"Was excited for this game since the original Alto is one of my faves. This game has ads much more often, but the real problem is, Alto is so tiny that I can't even see if I've completed a flip, so I have no idea when to let go of the screen tap/hold. And the writing is so small that I can't read the objectives for each level, I'm forced to start, then pause to see them and sometimes need to take a screenshot so I can zoom in. Some chasms seem too big to clear, maybe if he was easier to see..."
"It's 2019 and still no cloud save feature. This game is amazing, but my old phone died so I had to replace it. Well, I lost EVERYTHING. Funny thing is it remembered that I kept my ad free purchase and the coin doubler, but it didn't save anything else. Pitiful. I love the game but the lack of a save feature limits the overall rating substantially."
"Forces ads, even when you choose to skip them. Want to watch an ad to continue your run after crashing? No? TOO BAD! You're watching one anyway! An advertisement caused my game to hang after a video didn't load because I wasn't connected to a network. Of course you could spend 1,500 coins instead of watching an ad. Want to know how long it takes to get that many coins? A long, long time. Shame."
"Absolutely loved this game before the most recent update. Nice little relaxing time-waster with a great soundtrack. But with the new update (which isn't even published), after almost every single time you crash, it plays an unskippable ad that doesn't even revive you. It wasn't like that before, and with the absence of a ""No Ads"" purchase, I'm deleting it now. You had a great game here, but ruined it."
"Game consistently freezes at startup. Only the sound continues but the visuals don't continue through. Before this issue started occurring and making the game unplayable now, it was actually fun and relaxing. Once was a game I would play to lower my stress from other games and just calm down to. It's really a shame that a fix still hasn't been released for such a wonderful game."
"Great game but some of the worst ads I've ever seen in a game. I like the smoothness and ease of controls. I like the weather and time change effects. It's fun to veg out with, but they throw 30 second ads at you every other time you play. Plus, you can't get out of them. And, when it's over you have to fast forward then, ""X"" out of them. It's like they are fighting for your attention between the game and the ads! I like it but it just too irritating to validate dealing with it."
"its a very pretty game with nice music. those are about the only good things about it. the tutorial is very disruptive (and difficult?) especially for the style of game that it is. the tolerance for things like jumping off ramps and making it over the ""chasms"" is extremely low for being such a relaxed game, and it makes it very hard to play. it wouldnt bother me if it werent otherwise such a seemingly casual game."
"I am a fan of this series and I have about 10+ hours played on Alto's Adventure, but this game sucks...    Here are the problems:  -New mechanics make the game frustrating and difficult to enjoy. (The wall ride is buggy and confusing to use)   -It feels as it the game is design to have you fail frequently   -Chasms are unforgiving in this game (some chasm jumps alto can't get over and other chasm jumps don't have a warning sign)  -There is a  30sec video ad every time you level up (got so bad that I played the game on airplane mode)  -Some of the higher level task requires the main character to be in a specific region (for example grind 3 temple ruins) and it can take about 10-15 minutes to get to the appropriate region with a small possibility of completing the objective. If I use a compass it cost 1000 gold to use and if I want to skip it the objective that cost 1000 gold as well.    Alto's Odyssey feels like it's focused more on getting users to play the game longer (too make more profit) without make the game more enjoyable or relaxing.   It sucks because I think the series is great. The graphics and animations are beautiful. But these problems ruin the game for me"
"Beautiful looking game with nice physics. Unfortunately the random ads ruin the experience completely. There are way too many ads and they are inconveniently placed, long, and unskippable. It's difficult to close them and you will likely click one and be redirected to another app. I even had an ad pop up on my initial ap launch during the opening cenimatic sequence! Wow, what does that say about the devs and game immersion? I uninstalled five minutes after playing."
"god the ads in this game are rough. i love both of the alto games, but the addition/allowance of all these clickbait-y ads mskes them both borderline unplayable. the amount of times i've gotten an ad that (even once it's fully done) i fully cannot click out of is infuriating. it's always so sad to see games go down this route. 9/25: the amount of times ive watched an ad for a reward, been taken out of the game by said ad, and have had the game restart itself and get rid of the reward is unreal."
"Color choices blend the background and nighly invisible obstacles. The gameplay and audio are incredibly satisfying, but they quickly lose novelty due to excruciatingly repetitive and slow progression rewarding you with minimal content. The game is pay-to-play without ads, but you have plenty of time to try it out before the ads start showing up. It's an aimless endless autoscroller so give it a shot if you're into 2010 app gameplay with modern (although poorly planned) aesthetics."
"I loved the ios version of this game, and when I moved to android I was excited to see it was on the play store, however unlike the ios version the monetization is quite obtrusive, every time you crash you get a prompt to watch an ad to continue, then you get a prompt to watch an ad to skip one of the level up objectives, both of these defeat the point of the game. gameplay is awesome and super smooth, I would gladly pay for this game if was the only monetization but this ad fest makes me sad"
"The game itself was beautiful however the change in weather in the game is annoying especially since some of those changes make it hard to see what you're doing and there's no option to just buy the game. You get an option when you die to continue after watching an add or starting over. The first few plays you can start over uninterrupted, then every once in a while you get a couple long annoying ads when you start over (typically last from 30-60 seconds) then you get them everytime."
"The game was good on graphics and the atmosphere was calm, but it pisses me off when you include objectives which sometimes force you to pay coins to skip. Sometimes you go so fast that you don't see the next obstacle until you already collide with it. Pretty decent game, but needs a lot of work."
"this game could be great. the ads every time you die are SUPER annoying and completely kill the otherwise awesome ambiance of the game. Also I would like to be able to play this outside. I can sit in the shadiest spot, with my brightness all the way up, and I can't see anything when its ""night"" in game. zen mode is great, but I want to be able to progress without all the extra ads. I would seriously pay for an ad free version of this game. Did I mention the ads are terrible?"
"Good core gameplay, basically the same as the first one. They have adjusted the gameplay to monetize it, which is unfortunate. The game is ruined by awful video ads between attempts that you can't remove and they frequently auto open the Google play store. I am happy to purchase games or their ad free upgrades. I loved the first Alto game, this one is essentially unplayable as a way to chill out though. Tried to like this one too, uninstalling it now though."
"Three problems I'm going to mention here: • You get stuck in the ground when missing chasms often, and this makes it borderline impossible to play a single round even in zen mode • When you tap the players button to swap characters it often starts a new run instead of allowing you to swap characters • Felipe will crash even when you've lined up the landing to be smooth, no other character does this, just him"
"No longer a stress reliefing game until they start giving some terrible Ads to this game. Even those frustating Ads are not skippable! Its getting a lot of time to close!! This is a frustating game now...I have enjoyed this game since a long time ago, but now its not! Sorry to write a review like this :( All the other aspects of this game is good but all of them are wasted when they start giving painful ads!"
"Used to absolutely love this series. Now it's filled with ads with no option to pay to remove them. The performance has gone way down. Playing with a Pixel 7, it's very laggy. Never used to be like this (Alto is the same)."
Is this the Amazon App store version you just updated too? No Google play integration anymore? And the left most ad for Alto's Adventure says Amazon. Looks gorgeous in full screen though. I bought the double pack for Playstation.
"It's genuinely a great app, but holy CHRIST the ads. It ruins the experience and I wish that game developers didn't have to be so reliant on them, but it just completely wrecks the immersion."
"I loved the game, did not play it in a while but now the adds are very frequent and can't be skipped, you have to sit through them for almost a minute every time. Take's away the joy of playing this wonderful game."
"The game would be great if it didn't require you to watch ads to get an extra life. I'd be gladly to pay to just get a few lives from the start without having to watch ads for other games (I'm aware of the option to remove pop up ads, but that doesn't save you from the opt-in videos, and I think the missions are relatively difficult to accomplish without watching those)."
"I like the game, music, graphics (albeit sometimes too dark that you can't see rocks without increasing brightness to uncomfortable levels). Sometimes ads launch without clicking to revive and they are too long. Edit : lately i haven't been able revive. I watch video till end and then nothing happens. I tried several times over several days so since the problem is consistent and there is no update i had to edit my review and rating."
"Beautiful scenery, simple but realistic kinesthetics, and a really good balance between fun and challenge. Chill music & sound and the randomized levels are done very well. The words that pop up on screen are really distracting & cheapen the experience, as do the many screens you have to flip through to replay a run. The average person will spend about 1/3rd of their game time flipping through unwanted screens! Not including ads!! Remove the words/screens, give first levels & we might buy it!✌"
"Almost excellent. However, selective ads don't seem to have a ""skip after 5s"" feature, forcing you to watch the whole thing which is considerably annoying. That alone takes two stars off. Also, sometimes the goals text doesn't shift between black and white depending on the color of the background, so good luck reading that. EDIT: The achievement banners are enormous, blocking your view of the character if they're midair. I've wiped out twice because of those notifications, so one less star."
"It's kinda fun but I have no understanding of the incredibly varied outcomes to any move I do. Sometimes I go flying up the wall, other times, when I feel I've done the same move, I get into a backflip that I didn't want or I just slowly start sliding down. The changing times can also be frustrating. You have to decipher which blurs of black on the screen are going to end your run, or if a rock just randomly pops up because it's black blended in with the black of insert random background object"
"seems fun, but the sound is messed up. Crackly and poppy. This was installed on a ChromeBook"
"The tutorials aren't extensive enough for such specific timing needed. I love the background, music, and aesthetics, but there's not enough contrast with the foreground. I can't see all the rocks or tell them from bushes in the background. The player is way too small to properly see the shield while looking out for rocks. I would love a visibility option where the character and rocks are simply BIGGER or more zoomed in or more attention grabbing."
Deleted this games within a day. Beautiful graphics but to many ads!
A frustrating and less enjoyable sequel. This game introduces the 'wall grind' trick which could have been fun but is mostly frustrating. The physics of this new move are unpredictable which often results in crashes. The challenges also rely heavily on random generation luck. For example one challenge is to 'see two birds' but you have no control or knowledge over when they appear so it's just frustrating What made the first game great was its calm gameplay. Making it frustrating ruins that
"As wonderfully atmospheric as it may be, the gameplay is pretty hard to get into. And what especially annoys me are the rocks!! They blend in with the background so much, you don't see them till it's too late. It also feels unnatural to only press to/during the jump tbh, I keep wanting to press down for the character to accelerate, now it's a bit frustrating that he can't"
"The game itself is fantastic albeit when it goes dark it is slightly too dark to tell the difference between a rock or something else. The biggest annoyance is the ads - am fine with ads popping up to support the game makers but what is annoying is that the ""X"" to close the ads takes pixel precision as I am taken to the page to install the game at least about 5 x everytime I try closing the ad. Suspect this will put me off eventually - at least have a pay once for no ads option?"
"A fun, offline game with simple yet beautiful graphics. Unfortunately, I immediately uninstalled and will never play again for one reason: The optional ads are not optional. I understand the need for ads to be in a free game. However, you are presented with a choice when you 'die' of: End the run OR watch an ad to continue the run. Every two runs, even if I click end run I am still presented with a 30 second unskippable ad. Nope, I'm out."
"I originally downloaded this on iPhone and was happy to see that it was free when I made the transition to Android, however, this comes at the cost of constant bardes of in app purchases and ads that greatly take away from the core experience and atmosphere of the game. But in the other hand, the gameplay is still amazing and the visuals and music are absolutely stunning; it's just a bit of a shame to see the game wind up like this and I would gladly pay the AU$11.50 for the full version."
"I used to love this game but recently the ads are becoming way too bothering. After you die, you get a 30 sec ad with loud and annoying music that ends either with a bait demo or a screen that you can only skip with a small button that when I try to press, it takes me to the play store page of the ad because the button is either too small that I always miss it or most likely a fake. The devs clearly don't care anymore about the game and just use it as a cash grabber. No more updates. Just ads."
"I've tried playing this a few times over a couple years but the bad trick system always makes me quit within 15 minutes out of frustration. The reason is that, once you begin turning for a backflip and you realize you won't be able to make it, you cannot revert it by turning the other way around. The game forces an All or Nothing, full commit to the trick, and it feels horrible and unfair (since a failed trick means you die and must start over)."
"The game is simple, and enjoyable, but it is plagued with ads, and asks for $3.50 to get rid of them. This would be okay if they were able to be skipped, but many of them do not close properly, go on for too long, and place links in commonly pressed areas so that I'm forced to close the game to get rid of them. Also, the characters after Maya seem to suck the fun from the game with seemingly useless traits. In conclusion, it is a good game with trash execution."
"Had worked fine for a few month and suddenly it just freezes at startup. I have not done any changes to my phone or installed any new apps. I'm a technician so I know computers and programming. Deleting cache did not help, nor reboots. Deleting ALL data for it working again but I'm not about to start all over with all progress I had made, so now it will be uninstalled. It was getting quite annoying with ads that run for 30 seconds or more without being able to bypass them."
"The game is absolutely amazing, but I didn't play for like three days and it wiped all of my progress, I was quite far into the game too and racked up a lot of coins so this honestly makes me not want to play incase I lose all progress again. I was trying to find the cause and I found a way to reset your progress but I had never seen it before my progress actually got wiped, is there anyway to get my progress back?"
"I could play for hours in this lovely game, but the frequency, lenght and loudness of the ads is just beyond my understanding. I have no problem watching ads, but not every single time after the character fails, and not for 30 seconds, and the fact that the ads don't have a close button, and you have to go to Play Store and then go back to the app is just mind blowing. I cannot understand how there is no possibility to pay and completely remove the ads. I stopped playing the game."
"An awesome game, let down by one thing....The music stopping, jumping & skipping for no reason is annoying. I pre-registered for this game & the sound had been an issue since launch. 2 stars only because the audio shouldn't STILL be an issue since launch. I have sent a bug report via email & my review score will be altered, subsequently."
"I wish I could give 5* - It was good at first, I like the gameplay, but now after every run I get a long ad which then takes me straight to the play store. The only way to escape is to close the app, and after a few times I really can't be bothered opening it again. Its a shame, I had got quite far with the missions, I was starting to improve but this totally ruins the experience."
Love this game but the ads are very intrusive. Locks up my phone up where I can't get out of the ad videos
"Very enjoyable game.. Would happily pay money to disable the jarring video ads, and if that was an option my rating for this game would be much higher. Totally spoils the wonderful ambience to be confronted with aggressive video ads at the end of a run. Also the day night cycle is nice, but night makes the rocks much harder to see. Maybe give them reflections or something? Otherwise it's incredibly frustrating. I'm uninstalling the app now."
"It's just a big meh for me. First of all, it lacks good feedback, which makes alto not really fun to controll. Second of all, it's got redability issues, I lost too many times to obstacles I couldn't really see. The only nice detail is the fact that I could safely do backflips when I didn't see the ground, the camera moves down and the fall speed is low so there's enough time to react and land right side up. But this isn't enough to make up for the other problems."
"Bought having played on Apple Arcade. Was disappointed this version was missing the lost city. That premium version of the game was just a lot better than this version, mainly because a lot of the jumps weren't placed specifically to knock you over so you'd have to pay or watch a video to keep going. If you offered that version of the game I'd continue playing."
"The only great thing about this game is the audio. Other than that, obstacles are too blends into the background that it makes it difficult to spot, especially when your gameplay scene is set to night. I believe rotation speed can increase. Right now it's too slow, so its difficult to do ANY flips at all. Overall, graphics and audio are great, but boring and unrewarding gameplay. it gets monotonous after a few hours of playing."
"Pretty good game. Controls are hard (for me) to get so every run ends in a chasm as my jumps are not good enough. Also, instead of increasing difficulty of the runs, they just reduce the contrast making it hard to see anything. Got tired of never quite going fast enough to jump a chasm. Uninstaller."
Every time I went to jump over a rock it wouldn't let me and I would have to restart or watch an ad.
"Great game hurt by agressive adds. I understand and want free games to have adds, but when they put auto install buttons where the play again button is, or hide how to exit them, or auto open to the store anywhere you touch the screen, it really ruins the experience. Its easier to close the game and re-open it rather than be subjected to that."
"Beautiful game with lots of potential, disfigured by free-to-play trappings. Sure, you can pay to remove forced ads or grab the coin doubler, but the game is still tuned to make you watch as many videos as possible. I honestly don't care if that's how every one else does it. I don't care that this game is a mild offender. That still sucks. There's a reason I don't play anything without an upfront price. I broke that rule based on someone's recommendation. Never again!"
"Great game, stop giving me an add after every go. I get if it's let's say every 5 or something and if I wish to continue when I die, but I'm getting one after every attempt making it incredibly annoying. A shame as it's a fun game but don't wish to spend so much time watching ads."
You can't transfer progress between devices even though you're logged in via Google Games. I bought several upgrade packages on my old phone only to discover none of it transferred over to my new phone. I sent the devs a support email almost two months ago. I'm patiently waiting on their reply. Other than that the game is great.
Does not function properly on Galaxy S23 Ultra.
"This is an infinite runner game with tight controls and overall solid and interesting mechanics which is held back by one major flaw, that is that the rocks that kill you if you run into them are more often than not indistinguishable from any other background decoration. As a result the majority of deaths do not feel like the player's fault. If the rocks stood out more visually I'd say this would be a solid four stars but this one flaw makes it very frustrating."
Really nice and atmospheric game. Unfortunately the gaming experience is destroyed by an overwhelming amount of advertisements. This is especially annoying because there's no in game purchase option to get rid of the ads. I would totally pay for an ad free version of this game.
"I don't understand this. This is a winner of a game. Gorgeous clean artwork. What's wrong? The entire game is filled with ads and popups. The video ads don't go away even after paying to remove the ad pop ups. So, after every death in a round you end up seeing an ugly 3rd party advert video. Lord. I don't get why developers would ruin a beautiful UI and art theme with it, but oh well. Uninstalled. Good luck getting players to stay with all the ugly obstructive adverts."
"Good graphics and nice audio, but there are bugs with the system, there are constant glitches, very slight but still noticeable as microseconds of the display getting stuck, the ads are too loud with no mute option, the ads pop up way too frequently and often without even requesting them and there's no option to close them early. This feels like a money grubbing scheme where you guys just took more money and have less control. 2 stars was generous."
"Good game except no way to turn off between-turn ads. What really got me to put this down once-and-for-all was an unskippable 20 second ad. I don't play that. I'd pay .99, 1.99, something, for those to be gone. But only having ""pay to disable popup ads"" available is a deal-breaker."
"I get why people like it, but it just wasn't as fun for me. The graphics or style is beautiful but I struggled to see obstacles in time because they often blended with the background and seemed small. The music is excellent though. Would just listen to the music on its own."
"The physics in this game are absolutely crazy. Sometimes when you've gained an extreme amount of momentum and you jump really far and high, when you land you either glitch into the ground or completely lose all momentum. I once nailed a jump towards a ramp to cross a chasm perfectly, but because of the broken physics I went through the ground and into the chasm."
Original Alto was much better. Alto Odyssey is just nowhere near as consciously or intuitively built. Odyssey tends to prompt you to intuitively do things that will force you to fail. Sometimes the ground on the other side of chasms is too far or too high to reach even if you complete the chasm jump the way they want you to. You have basically no control on wall rides. Often goals are based upon settings that may not pass after a really long time. There's just no room to improve with practice.
"If you fall, you have to pay in game currency (really!? why?) or you will start over. Either that or watch a whooping 30 second ad of some trashy game every time :( Just make it a paid app instead for crying out loud. Music is relaxing. Repetetive backgrounds and levels. Overall disappointed and generally not impressed. Remove the annoying redudant ads and in-game currency and I might rate it 3 instead."
"Too many adds. Like, literally after a run there's 2 adds pop up, and you have to wait at least 5-6 secs before been able to turn them off. The game's been enjoying so far but adds? No thanks. Alto games used to be relaxing, peaceful and especially ad-free. Not full of junks like this."
"When you complete all three objectives , next level should start within the same gameplay. Thats how it should be. It happens many times that what you have already achieved in prior gameplays, come up again in next level as new objectives. If i achieve multiple objectives, they should be considered as achieved even when i have not reached that level. Guys please sort this out. One less star for not sorting this issue since last time."
"I loved the original Alto and I still love this game, but it's just too buggy. Alto used to be a fun escape but a lot of the time Odyssey lags extremely hard on a run and causes a crash. Mostly after you've gotten very far, which is very demoralizing."
"This game is very aesthetic and pretty, but the game itself feels kind of cheap. There are many things rushing past you and the game does a really bad job of explaining which ones are harmless and which ones will end your run if you hit them. Other hazards like chasms have a little danger sign before you hit them but you cant see the chasm shape until you are already jumping off. The main problem is by the time you can see most obstacles its too late to do anything about them."
"A potentially wonderful game ruined by the adverts that occur every time you crash... I've just started playing and I'm crashing all the time, so it's advert after advert after advert. Unfortunately I'll probably just delete it. What a pity so many good apps are ruined with excessive and irrelevant advertising."
"Game looks awesome, but I had to uninstall shortly after installing. The game itself was great but after just about every run there was a 30 second+ ad. Being bad at the game at first means you spend more time watching ads than playing the game. Quite annoying."
"The only reason I am giving this game less than five stars is because of the ADS.. in the original game (alto's adventure) you would only see ads if you wanted to continue after failing during a run. With this new game I'll ads all the times, not a lot, but just enough to be annoying. If the ads were about similar games I wouldn't be as aggravated but they are ads that don't relate to this game at all."
"What is the point in an option to choose to watch an ad to stay on your run, if ads play anyway. No matter what you do ads pop up everywhere! I really really liked this game, and was fine with watching an ad if i want to keep going, but now i have to watch ads to play in general!"
This game is soo cool and relaxing to play ... But the free ads clearly ruined the mood. If I have to watch a 30 sec. video to revive my player then why do I watch the ad anyway after I end the game and go for new one .If your showing us ads for no reason then atleast compensate for it with gold or free revive.
"Despite being a sequel to Alto's Adventure, controls seem worse. In the prequel, flips could be made in very tight radii with less speed and hight. In Odyssey, it seems flips need either more space or have a very tight landing hitbox, making combos and run longevity difficult to maintain."
"I would love to give this game more, because it's beautiful, but I can't play it. Every time you do a run, the light changes, becoming darker and making it so, so difficult to differentiate obstacles from the rest of the scenery, especially if, like me, you have poor eyesight. Until there is an option to disable this change of lighting, I won't be able to play, which is such a shame, because it has the potential to be such an amazing experience."
"i like the game quite a bit, and would very gladly pay for it, but the only option i have is to sit through ads. this is very much not how i want to spend my very limited leisure time, and because of this, i play it very infrequently. also, the ads break the momentum of the game, and i get impatient waiting for them to end. if i want to feel impatient, ill go sit in traffic. i don't want to feel that way after a long day at work."
"DEAR, developers the game is good and awesome gameplay I have only one demand and that is you guys should add some more action on the game I just love the music on the game Woh itz just amazing thank you thank you very much.. keep it up good luck Edit: I used to love this game after a while I reinstall the game but my previous data is not loading I don't know why I tried every a possible 😓 very disappointed"
"It's a great game and I've been playing it nonstop for about 2 months. But after I signed in with my Google account , weird noises can be heard in the background which is quite irritating. Also the amount of ads has increased substantially. Would've given a five star otherwise."
"Really not up to the hype. Tutorial wants you to jump a gap. Puts messages you have to tap to dismiss. The tap messes up the jump & you respawn without enough run up to clear the jump. So head straight to the main game, which has a ""watch adds to continue"" mechanic. The game punish you hard before you get a chance to get to grips with it, then it's pay coins or watch adds. Overall, Looks pretty. But it's not ""immersive"" or clever. It's another run and grab coins game with a nice soundtrack"
"The game is relaxing and chill. You surf around looking at beautiful scenery, doing sick jumps and flips. Had a few upgrades too but unfortunately till recent, the game is now crashing at the main menu, freezing the phone until I get the message that the app is not responding on the Razer Phone 2. Tried reinstalling and clearing cache but nothing. Razer Cortex is saving it from me uninstalling it because of the daily silver."
"There's no issue with the game itself, but the damn ads. It's every, single, round. And on top of that if there's an ad playing I can't close the app? And the ads COVER the button to end the ad. Decent game but you need to find a better revenue source because this is ridiculous."
The game is good. I unlocked every character in the game. Now when I reinstalled the game it's starting from beginning even after saving it to google play games. I also have achievements of every character unlocked but still not getting the game from where I stopped..
"hardly notice a rock when dark, especially it on top of the background with dark color. cant see what on the signboard when dark, causing hard to decide to do a back flip or prepare to wallride. too many ads, popping up too frequent, it becomes very annoying and frustrating when you keep fall and the ads keep popping up, should just show after a few minutes"
"There are goals that simply cannot be reached. I did 10 backflips like 10 times and it never counted. Now I have to do a wall ride and a flip across a chasm....only one problem, I have never seen a chasm with a rideable wall in front of it. How am I supposed to complete a goal if there is no place in the level to execute it? Stupid. Uninstall."
"Amazing game, terrible developer. Ads are very intrusive and annoying. I'd easily pay $20 for the option to switch them off. Developer used to be great but have followed competitors to become greedy and lazy with a focus on ad revenue from extremely questionable and scammy sources. Shame as the game is quite special."
"The game is is really nice, with the graphics and the music. But the ads are just insufferable, there are many 30 seconds ad that can't be skipped and you have to sit through those ads everytime you die."
"It's cute and fun and all, but theres so many clickbait ads that show up every time you fall in the game. And theres no X to close the ad until the ad has played for at least 5 seconds. Ads suck. Makes me not want to play."
During dark theme (night and sunset) is unplayable. Can hardly distinguish the character from the objects in the background. Obstacles are difficult to see. It's frustrating. Need some contrast added to the textures to help out.
"Ads are crashing the game now. I've played this for hours, with no objectives left to complete and I've maxed out the power-ups (even the useless compass), and I keep playing. But I can't and won't play if the ads crash the game"
"So frustrating, game is literally on the line of being awesome. character flips way too slow (good luck landing flips) , rocks are too small to see too avoid crashing into making it very easy for the player to start all over again or watch an ad. I'll pass."
"Ads gradually become more frequent, i get that its free but when you start playing the ads show rarely but as you progress ads are shown after each game and some are 20-30 seconds long without a close button. Shame because game is well done. Same applies for the first game in this series."
"So many ads and you can't even skip them The game itself is pretty boring, you can't really control the character that much, the upgrades are useless, really the only thing this game is good for is relaxing, but after playing it a while it gets boring and the ads just annoy you more and more"
"I dont like that idea where the player has to end the run to achieve goals for next level, why cant developers reset the parameter or the new goals value to zero as soon as previous gets achieved and let the current Run stay. Otherwise i love the game ,its superb . if you guys can acknowledge and reply to this with something acceptable i am good with it . i really wanna rate this game as 5 star"
"Visually appealing game but terrible gameplay. The person flips so slow there's no chance for you to correct yourself. The rocks come up so fast you're worried about making sure you hold the screen long enough for you to compete the flip only to smash into a rock you can barely see. Screen needs to be zoomed put more, and faster flips. This game would be 4 or 5 stars."
"Another endless runner with no storyline. Control is not that fluid. Your attention must always be directed to the bottom-right corner of your screen to look for rocks so that you won't stumble. The worst thing is, on a steep downward slope, your reflex won't be enough to save you from stumbling (the rocks appear from almost bottom-left corner of screen). Probably it's the intended mechanics so that you have to watch adverts to revive your player."
"I loved the first game, and love this one as well, but the ads are horrible. I'm fine with ads, even video ones, but when it pauses my music in the background I'm all done. You annoying me isn't going to make me pay you money to stop, I'll just not support you. Would have paid to remove ads had you not resorted to the intrusive ones you went with. You decided to allow ads that greatly hindered the user experience, so I won't support you. Goodbye."
"this is a great game but I'm unfortunately installing because whenever I reach around 280,000 points, the game crashes. this is preventing me from completing the final goal of 350,000 points. real shame. this bug has to be fixed."
The look is beautiful but nothing new about the gameplay that's worth the difficulty to get the hang of. I play games to relax not to stress myself over random things that'll appear in front of the character.
"Good one. But the previous version is preferable to this. It's mainly because of the sound system. Besides, this version has strange colors. I felt sth fishy when played it for half an hour and moved my eyes around."
"not able to distinguish between a rock and a plant during nights and thunderstorm . The obstacles come out of nowhere and all you can do is fall into them . The drops of radio are falling behind the player . This game is full of bugs and errors ! It was a wonderful experience at first , but has become an source of irritation for me now ."
I enjoyed playing this uno game my only issue is there is an increase in the number of ads and commercials it's between every other game plus everytime you do something extra in the game there's more ads and commercials on top of that and it has become a nucents. This game needs some work. I also think that if your friends give you coins you should be able to collect them and there shouldn't be a cap on how many times you can collect in one day that ridiculous. I hope you fix the issue. Thank u.
"This Uno game can be extremely fun. I do not like that you must have coins for every game. You can get ""free"" coins but you must go through several hoops and ads to get them. Lose one hand and its back through the hoops. Thats when I quit. Also there are a lot of ads. Like A LOT. I also think that the time limits on the game and hands are extremely short. I feel very very rushed in both. This game does have its fun parts but I find myself more annoyed then amused. I just wanna play Uno :("
"Good game and all, but this app is rigged as hell. I went from having nearly 20k in coins to less than half that amount in the span of one night. I was winning 1 in every 5 or 6 matches. The gameplay is flawed and filled with bugs. For example, if a player is down to one card, he'll change the color to blue. But when I challenge him on blue, (I know he has blue) I end up having to draw the cards. Meanwhile, he lays down blue anyways, giving him a win."
"I was really enjoying this game for about a month. I won and lost, both fair amounts. I ended up getting up to 100k in coins. Now all of a sudden it is impossible for me to win. I win maybe 1 out of every 10 games, maybe? My coins just keep decreasing. And when I first started playing I got shields all the time for x20. Now is only get them for x4 or x8. Seems like the game is designed to make you spend money. I'm about to give up playing it."
"I love Uno. The game is set up in a way that only allows you to play if you have enough game coins. In the beginning you have great hands and win more game coins. Later, you have bad hands and lose coins. The app then bombards you with request to pay real money to get enough game coins to play. Seems like a set up. This makes uno frustrating instead of fun. Uno should be fun."
There are TONS of ads. When you do a x4 like I did it can take much more than it said. It said it would only take 500 and ended up taking 1500 coins. It pressures you to make micro transactions relentlessly and most of the time there not worth it. The only point when it's worth it is when you're playing with friends and even then you can only do that for free 10 times then you pay for it just to earn xp
Fun with an exception...I been playing this uno app off and on for years. The game is designed for you to win a few and lose A LOT. Especially if you have a lot of coins. Once you reach a certain amount the game will keep making you lose no matter how good of a hand you have. Absolutely annoying and unfair.
"Such a scam. It's really hard to save up coins in this game, so after all the bonuses in the beginning, you shouldn't do the high multiplier challenges. It also constantly disconnected me and forced me to uninstall and restart the game, losing all of my progress. I also spent $2 on the game for extra coins and diamonds, but it actually disconnected me again and I lost that virtual currency. Fun, but a bad addiction."
"Great game! Could play for hours. Only problem i see is with the Uno Universe. Each level gives you tasks to complete (earning you special items), but the other players only want to hurry up and win instead of doing the tasks and earning the special items. It makes it almost impossible to do it. Also, there is no way to openly communicate with the other players."
"Would have liked it more if the tutorial wasn't so annoying. I realize my opinion may change later, but please, at least make the tutorial optional or skippable? To add onto my complaint, computer player turns take too long and it is hard to tell who's turn it is, going into each game because the backgrounds are too busy, making it hard to see if any of the players are highlighted. Overall, the ganeplay was nice, but I had a very annoying experience."
"This game is both fun and annoying at the same time. I like UNO, but hate the coin system. I also believe the game is rigged in some fashion. The cards are most likely not truly randomized and a winner is already preselected before the match even starts. Scenario 1: I can go from 500 coins to 28,000 and then lose it all to 0 in less than 30 minutes? Scenario 2: I get up past 2000 and then get knocked back down for over a week over and over and over. Remove the coin system and make it random!"
"Too many tech issues!!! This game needs a serious overhaul to be the excellent game that it could be. In a single match, the amount of times the game freezes & then says ""timed out"" is ridiculous. Of course, there's now an issue with the nonexistent update, where we can't even log in. The algorithms set on the game is too far from a true game of UNO. There's no way to communicate with other players, which is seriously dated. Compared to the revenue generated, it's lacking."
"The game is, for the most part, fun and playable. It's the little bugs that bother me. For instance, with some frequency, a game will just suddenly end BEFORE time has expired. And I don't mean 2 or 3 seconds. I mean, like 20 or 30 seconds before time expires. Also, if the game comes down to the wire, and you literally discard one of your cards into the center just as time expires, the game does not register it for some reason. And the support? 👎"
"The app needs some work. The cards are ""sticky"" so to speak, meaning it fails to register which card you're trying to play sometimes and either does not play it or sends out the wrong one. I experienced issues with lag where my turns were basically skipped by the game. It's also on a gambling system, which, I'm not a huge fan of but that's a personal preference."
"Having a mandatory time limit for a game that sometimes requires critical thinking and planning is garbage, not to mention the amount of ads you get at once. Was on a loss streak of 12 before uninstalling, 6 of em by the time limit, 4 of em from server lag (even got kicked out a few times), and 3 of em bankrupted me. You may have made the game more challenging by these, but not in a good way. This is now one of the most frustrating card games i have ever had the chance to play."
"The point system here is just greedy and designed to ensure that you lose. The game itself is fun to play, but it's incredibly difficult to make progress because of the way they designed the cost vs payout from playing. At it's most basic, it costs 130 coins to join a game (100 for the round and 30 to match you up with strangers). If you lose, you lose those 130 coins plus more depending on how many cards you have. You could potentially lose 250+ coins just by losing. If you win, you profit less than what you bet. You'll win around 30-100. That means you're always taking one step forward and two steps back. It's completely designed so that the more you play, the more you lose. Obviously their end-goal is to get IAPs, but this is a terrible way of doing it because you can purchase 3000 coins and easily run out after a few rounds. TLDR: The point system sucks. If you win, you'll win like 30-100 coins, but if you lose, you lose 130-250 coins. It's designed so that you lose coins at a faster rate than you win them."
"The two stars are for uno itself, the game is a classic and it did bring back some fun memories of playing it after school with friends etc. The app does a good job of capturing that. However, the enjoyment is short-lived. I don't like saying this about a game, and I use it as an absolute last resort. The game has rigged outcomes designed to keep you spending money. You can go from having a hot streak to the other players (possibly bots) with unbeatable combos that end the game in a few turns."
"I was doing great then I wasnt. Clearly not all functions work as they should. Either a result of poor programming or the game is totally rigged. I would like to see the formula they use to 'randomly"" select matches. The option to hit UNO before a player calls it, works inconsistently. Of course there are in app purchases that are annoying and there have been glitches where the game doesnt come back after the add has ended and you have to restart. Anyone experience this? ."
"Uno should be fun. This version is not fun. I even purchased the no-ad version (I was wasting so much time on ads), but the game is rigged to bankrupt you, so you have to watch ads. I've lost over 180,000 coins and been bankrupted almost 40 times in the month that I've played. This morning, I won more games than I lost and still was bankrupted twice. I am uninstalling and moving on."
"I like the game but it does tend to get confusing with all the extra distractions. Since I can win coins and other extra perks I have zero issue with that. The app will only allow me to play using wifi at my house.( I checked my settings) I assume this is because that's where I started playing. I have tried to restart my phone, force stop the app and uninstall then reinstall. Nothing has worked which is extremely frustrating. Please fix ASAP"
"The game play is fine, but *do not* purchase coins for the game. Play lower levels & build them up. Their point system isn't totally transparent and they don't mention at all that there's a minimum you can lose. So winning with a card total doesn't seem to net you as much as if you were to lose with that same total. Since you can spend real money, it doesn't seem like that should be allowed, much less legal."
"2.5/5 frozen and wont go past the load screen after last update. Game seems to be very fixed with A LOT of bots that time out and never call uno (kinda sucks having one as a teammate). Freezes a lot during my turn which doesn't allow me to play the card I want. The ads don't really bother me. If the game worked, with less bots, and it didn't seem so fixed to make you watch ads because all your tokens are gone it would be an easy 5 stars."
"Everytime I open up the app I'm bombarded with tons of pop ups and messages. When the app initially came out it wasn't bad and didn't hit the player with a ton of messages, but that is not the case now. whenever I go to open the app I have the expectation to be able to just hop in a game and enjoy a couple quick rounds. I inevitably end up spending the same amount of time as two rounds just trying to get past the ads/messages to get into a game."
"To be honest when I first downloaded the game I was having a super fun time but as time went on it just felt more and more rigged. One thing that especially bugs me is that all the games are timed, like really? 3 minutes to play a game of uno? And then at the end with the reduced time limit it sucks even more because if you're not doing great you're at a huge disadvantage. I have so much more to say but there just isn't enough space here. If you're looking for good uno, get the pc version of uno"
"It was okay but the sound effects were extremely annoying, the profile photos looked strange, and the controls were a bit complicated for me since I'm more used to playing Uno on the Nintendo Switch. I wouldn't download but this is just my opinion. The game play was good. Just some things that bothered me."
"It's an alright game, if you don't take into account the forced stop of the game for about a day if you run out of coins to use and how that can easily be done with higher multiplier rounds where it gives opponents all the skips and draw 4 wild cards in the world to the point you and your teammate simply draw cards never lay one down. You just have to pay to play the game in that case and if you don't want to or can't, you're out of luck without diamonds or the ads for coins."
"The app is a hot mess - constantly crashes and freezes to the point I have to open it five times before I even manage to start a game. But, I'll live. However, I am totally over coins. Rigged or not, I don't know, but it's ridiculous to play nothing but modes where >200 coins are required only to lose 800+. Provide a free mode, or limit the amount you can lose per mode. And, maybe it's just me, but it's always so BUSY. I'm sick of all the collabs and miss when it was just Uno."
"Its a classic game that I expect to be fun for everyone. It just seems like the coins system is broken. I think it would work better if you didn't lose anymore coins than the requirement to enter the match (ex: x2 Go Wild! Is 200 coins minimum, you shouldn't lose more than 200). Ive losts just shy of a thousand on x2 Go Wild! several times and it just feels like a tactic to get you to spend money."
Complete disappointment that the game is all about getting more coins. Every game is timed and there are no options to play a real classic game. All games seem to be live play and again zero option to just play against bots. Seriously after waiting for UNO to come out with a better version of their previous beyond glitchy version I was so excited when I saw this one. Now I just miss the version that included the special versions of UNO with different rules. This app has lots of room to grow.
"Edit: App got even worse. So much clutter, useless features, difficult to accumulate coins--all up to chance in 3 mins. Might as well be a gambling game. Deleting. Main issue is the 3 minute time limit. It leaves so much up to chance and it gets abused as people intentionally take as long as they can (without much penalty, if any). That's simply not UNO, and is not an incentive to invest any money in the app. Why use all the extra features and boosters when you hardly have time to strategize?"
"This game at it's core let's you play the UNO game we all know and love. However, the amount of pop-ups ruined the experience. This includes microtransaction pop-ups and even those annoying out-of-app banner notifications at any given moment. I just don't like having to tap through a ton of different screens in order to play a quick game and it made playing the game laboring."
"The game lags, my picture doesnt show, and when i start a game, I'm stuck on the loading screen when the game is continuing. I quit the app then go back and the game is half way over. Sometimes it doeant let me pick a color, or let me know when its my turn, or even let me know how much time I have. I recently upgraded my internet so Please Fix It !"
"This is a tad different from old school Uno. The game is fun but, once you make one purchase it will ask you to make more on an annoyingly consistent basis. They tried to get me to spend so often I eventually uninstalled the app. Also, if you play in classic mode it costs you 100 coins to play but you may not even get 100 coins if you win...you lose way more than you gain with this game. Coins go fast because of what's required to participate in a match. All about getting your money!"
"3 minute games.... most games are not won by getting rid of your cards, like in the table-top version. in this version, most games ""time-out"" and players are ranked by the point value of the cards left from their hand. would be nice to at least give the option for longer games, 4-5 minutes would be great. it gets annoying when no one really wins, over & over again."
this game is fun for a little while but once you hit level 11 they start rigging it to make it impossible for you to win. in the beginning you get plenty of wild cards and then after level eleven you get almost none.. making it really hard to win because the other people are constantly playing wild cards on you. very annoying. I will be deleting the game.
"Fun for a little while but if you don't spend money, the game works against you. Opponents getting stacks of +2 and +4. You have to earn coins to play but the point system seems to triple when you lose so even if you've got a single number 1 in your hand if you lose, you'll lose about 100 coins each time. All in all, fun for about 20 mins until you can't get out of a losing streak and no way to come back without spending money."
App constantly crashes now. Please fix. Was unable to finish competing for rank in ranked mode for the last week of the season. Please don't tell me it's my phone or network's issue. This looks like it's a large portion of your player base. I run a Note10+ and I can run mmorpg (like BDM) without issues. Your basic non graphics heavy card game app crashes at LAUNCH. So how does restarting the game repetitively fix the issue? Don't blame the end user. Investigate your issue.
"It was initially fun as some games can use strategy, but then once you get a certain amount of coins then they'll make you lose game after game so that you use all coins and will have to pay to buy more. They're out for the people that play several games in a row, if you play only a few then they will let you win, but not several, their aim is to get you down to 0 so you have to pay. There are also lots of ads after every game and some you can't x out of so you have to restart the whole game."
"I cannot get into the game. The loading screen stays there forever and I keep completely closing it and it still does it. I went on the website to contact them andet them know about the issue. After I filled out the form I did the little captcha check mark box and it turned green. I clicked submit and it said I failed the robot test. So they make it so you cannot conact them if there is an issue. I enjoy the game when I can play it, but the lack of ability to communicate with them makes mad!"
"Fun for a bit. Turns into a pay to play or get rained on with ads between games. Some are loud, others can't be skipped, and the rest loop you through different websites or try to install other games. Game play is alright with quick match making. It will switch you to bigger risk/reward games once you win a few times without knowing and loose your progress once lost. Good to waste time with finding free coins in the 10+ menu options, but not worth the hastle."
"Game has excellent potential. The coin system is set where it cost you coins, even if you win 2nd sometimes you lose coins. If you don't have at least 100 coins you can't play. It encourages you to play for higher stakes where if you lose you lose more. There is a 3 minute time limit. In the beginning it's great, because there is plenty of extra coins given. The coin restrictions & time limit, with some people running the clock out ruins this game. If you can deal with the aggrevation? Go for IT"
"The basics of the game are good. Easy to play and with good graphics. However, all the additional junk they threw in to make it ""interesting"" is a mess. And the worst of all, ""Uno Universe"" is nearly impossible to advance after some point. The NPC's get an automatic win almost every time."
"There should be more ways of earning diamond's, coins & other rewards. Cost of items is to high. It would be nice to see more options for graphics. I had 5 stars in season 8 ranked mode. I couldn't get the game to update or play. So, I uninstalled it and reinstalled it only to find out it deleted my fifth star and left me with 4 stars in ranked mode. When in ranked mode, I loose almost every game. It seems rigged to loose to get me to buy. However, it makes me want to stop playing altogether."
"I like the game a lot, but there's a few things that need to be fixed. The scratchers always give you a weak prize and are rigged and everyone should be able to get the good items, so they don't lose coins and etc. I haven't gotten a shield, since before this recent update. Also fix the videos. The (watch videos for coins and diamonds) sections don't work which is really frustrating for people who lost all their coins forcing players to spend money or wait 24 hrs. Please fix this."
"Game is constantly freezing. Ruining the games, causing you to lose. Sometimes if you purchase a package, it doesn't give you what it's supposed to give you and they won't respond to the complaints and if they do, refuse a refund or refuse to give you what you're supposed to get. Edit- as I responded before, cashe is always clear and no other apps running. It's clear something needs fixed as it looks like I'm not the only one with problem and other games do not act like this. Figure it out."
"I LOVE Uno and this app is good in many ways HOWEVER there are NO instructions. I have found some things just by experimenting. But no way to just pause the game. Instead it tells me it ""lost connection"". When it reconnects of course it charges you more coins. Also would be nice if you could opt for partners you have played with before and veto others that didn't play that well. That little icon pops up on the last round and even though I have a card ready to play it plays a different 1 ."
"This game has so much potential to be fun, but like other reviews say, they just want you to spend money. They charge too many coins for everything. You have to pay to be matched with a partner, pay to play different formats, pay to win and pay to lose. I know that sounds weird, but if you play, you'll see what I mean. The worst thing is that when you win, you get like 50 coins, but when you lose, it's like -350. It's hard to follow sometimes, too, like the rules aren't super clear. Uninstalled!"
"It's not great. Way too many self promotions, way too many money grabs. Costs game currency to play each round on top of whatever you lose (based on score). Still have to pay for the round if you win. I made it a month. It was a love/hate relationship the whole way through. Sucks all the fun out of the game."
"The game itself is good. But the ads are ridiculous. I continuously get an ad in a foreign language that you cannot close. The buttons (in a different language) at the bottom do nothing but open a spam website, same with clicking anywhere on the ad. An X to close it never appears, no matter how long you wait. So every time I get this ad, which is after every other match I play, the only way to resume playing is to shut down the ap and reopen it Horrible user experience"
"I'd give it a 100 stars for the game and the apps stability, but the ads are too annoying I noticed the frequency of ads has been increased in the last week or so, It's a full screen non skipable ads that show up every other game and it's really frustrating. Please try a different approach to show ads such as banner ads from the home screen till the game screen and reduce frequency of full screen ads, apart from this I absolutely love this game. I hope the Team reads this, Have a good one 👍"
"The game is great to play. But I'm not quite sure how the teammates are chosen. I will play with folks, and they puck the wrong cards on purpose like it was a bot trying to lose on purpose. And it's always after I buy coins. Always. And then I get terrible teammates back to back. Then, the game freezes, during my turns and the computer plays my turn, choosing a card I wouldn't. 🙄 . There are glitches."
"Pretty good game overall...the biggest thing the devs should definitely look at changing...is if someone plays a draw 4 and you challenge and win the challenge...the color should NOT change. People are taking advantage of that loophole abd winning by sacrificing playing a draw 4 just to change the color to win. Fix that and it'll be a higher rating from me. Also the trophy system ratio is horrible. Example...you lose, you lose 12 trophies but when you win...you only win 8!?"
"Nothing I love more than 5 popups asking for purchases or ""side missions"" when I open the app, when all I wanted was a simple game of uno. Please don't turn this into one of those ridiculously annoying apps where this becomes a permanent thing. Please. EDIT: I will happily change my rating if/when there are improvements."
"Love playing this game but this app is designed to only take money from users within the game and outside as well. You have to pay to remove ads or to participate in seasonal events. And every game has a ""match fee"". You end up losing more coins than winning."
"Once again AI is not believable. Somehow the cards always favor one player way more than others. You can spot winner after one or two rounds. So unrealistic. And I stand by my words. The draw cards defy the odds. In Ranked mode it's somehow harder to win even though you're supposed to play with the same deck. This game is fun for a while, then you lose your patience."
"I'm a bit disappointed with this game, the randomness of card draws doesn't feel fair most of the time. There's matches you start and have great hands, but more times than not you have nothing to play off of. I've never had this bad of luck in the real game. It borderline feels like the game is cheating for the people who pay to play. Ads suck but are expected with a game like this. Hopefully things change"
"The most ads I have ever seen in any game, seriously. I tried to force myself to ignore it, but I just can't do it anymore. Every single freaking thing you do, an ad will pop up. When you open Uno 2 or 3 ads pop up, before you even get done with every single game all the way, an ad hurries up and pops up. You have to watch multiple ads to win coins since you need a certain amount to play the game, or you could buy coins/gems with real money. It's sad because I wanted to love this."
"Frustrating. Game is enjoyable, unfortunately you regularly win three games in a row, lose the forth and end up bankrupt. You loose far more coins than you win. Additionally too many bots and odds stacked against you. Basically if you want to play for any period of time or play at the higher end then you need to spend really money. The game will try and force you to do so. I won't be spending though so I will have limited play time."
"The time limit of 3 minutes is too short for a decent game to be played fully. People also abuse the time limit by riding out the fullest extent of their turn. Nothing is more frustrating than having one wild card left to play to win a game, but you aren't able to play it because someone decided to try to beat the draw 4 before the timer ran out. (They didn't beat the timer, and also screwed me along with them)"
"I really liked it at first glance. Nice design, different type of games. Really nice touches. BUT! The ads are unstoppable, everything is based on the ads or the purchases. For me, it lost its meaning. To play, you need to have coins. If you win, someone loses coins. The same if you loose. Someone wins. I don't like the mindset behind the development of this app. There are so many other games to play in this pattern, why spoiling a world famous party game?"
What in EARTH is going on with this site? Game lags so much that it is impossible to play as one should; there is NOTHING wrong with my phone or internet. I'm losing a lot of credits because of this nonsense and want it to either stop or be reimbursed. I am a long-time player and you've had enough of my money to make your site work.
"This game is addictive but I really don't like when the players are not dropping any cards and the game do automatically if the game instead dropping automatic should make them to take automatically that way the players will pay attention, please stop automatic dropping cards make them to take automatic cards. Also we lose more coins than we get when we win."
Too many ads.. and the bot players are boring. All about making money.. you get ripped off constantly. How is it possible to to get tricked into a game and the leader can change it from low to high.. you get ripped off.
"I like this game. However, it is really annoying how you can't claim all rewards at once, instead, having to claim them one by one. Also, the sudden tutorials taking me away without letting me decline. I don't care about the stupid events, so stop wasting my time. And then there are the pop-ups. Every single time you open the app, they bombard you with 5 to 6 pop-ups that you won't read. And there's no way to turn them off. I would not recommend downloading."
"Very addictive and fun, but feels like you're getting nowhere. You just keep on losing all your coins, and then need to start all over again. Started playing Monopoly Tycoon, MUCH MORE REWARDING and super fun."
"It's a great concept but wow, there are still some really annoying bugs in regards to watching the ad, but no with reward. Very much PTW too, which is sad to see a childhood game evolve into. As I said, I've enjoyed this a lot, but the bugs for FTP users is very demoralising."
I like the game but the Glitch..This is my second review. It didn't change a thing. I think it became worst. It always happened to me like when i won alot of coins the next game will have glitch. Frooze or disconnect and can not be reconnected. When i log it in again almost half of my coins were gone. It always happening whether i am connected to wifi or mobile data. I play also play mobile legend or rummikub or even clash royale i didn't experience that i disconnect from the game.
Good game to play to pass the time but it's clearly rigged with bots. You'll get dealt good hands to win some coins but then suddenly go against impossible hands and lose 10 games in a row. It's set up to make you spend real money on coins. Just don't spend any hard earned money and watch some ads for free coins
I used 2 love playing this game. I have reached out sooo may times due to losing coins in the middle of games but they dont reimburse. Yet the glitches & freezes continue constantly. Ive unistalled this game so many times but still go back cuz its fun. As soon as another glitch Im mad! Playing this game is a gamble & a risk. Ure definitely gonna lose coins due to the glitches no matter how much u risk. Just play at ure own risk. I honestly would love this game if it didnt freeze so bad
Game is fun but it allows others to cheat and win. Challenging a draw four and winning the challenge can actual hurt you in the end because even though the opposing player has to draw the cards for bluffing they still get to change the color. Fix this and this game is awesome.
"I was very much enjoying the game. But they did an in-system update, and now it runs so slow. I keep getting ""connection issues"" and it's causing me to miss turns and run down the clock. The game is now unplayable"
Quite terrible. The game keeps crashing on my Xiaomi even in guest mode. I played it before on other devices and it's fine. It was fun on other devices so I'll give it 2 instead of one. My phone is limited to Android 8.1 so can you update the app pls? That would be great 😃 Thx.
Ads. Lots of ads even back button leads to an ad to buy coins and gems its frustrating. And coin mechanic is really poor when u ran out of coins then you cant even play. Either remove the coin system or implement better system. Overall did not have fun.
"The whole set up is a mess. The gameplay, the amount of coins you need to play a round, the way the online play is set up... Everything is problematic and takes all the fun out of playing. It's a shame because it's one of the most fun games to play in real life."
"I love this game, I have been playing it for YEARS; but I miss the old event stuff. What's with the collections of cards thing?? I don't want to collect ""decks"". What is this??? ""Yu-Gi-Oh! UNO! Edition""??? I'll change my review once this collecting nonsense events ceases."
"It is a fun game. But it's kind of stupid when you play 2vs2. You lose, so your teammate loses all coins of 4k while you lose 10k coins. There should seriously be a controlled gap. Im tired of losing 10k at a time while these random players only lose 4k to 6k in the same match."
"Never had an issue for 2 years. Went to log in today, says I have to download latest update to continue. I download latest update, now for 7 hours it won't go past the ""Attempting to reconnect"" screen. Tried Uninstalling & reinstalling, same error."
"What on earth is the ""gotcha"" feature where every time youre about to hit uno the opponent magically gives you a +2? And its always a higher ranking opponent? So many rounds ive been ganged up on like this...and i cant find any rule in their settings that explains this? Honestly just really frustrating and kind of unfair..... Honestly, even when we press UNO it still allows the other team to pull a ""gotcha"" and give you 2+ cards..."
"The game would be a lot better if you could at least skip the ads after a certain amount of time, it makes you not want to play because after every match come the ad and the only way to close it is by closing the app"
"Ever since I was a kid, I've always loved uno! This app 90 percent of the time is fantastic. Then the app freezes, or someone on it is cheating, and you lose everything !! NOT OKAY!!"
If you like watching adverts with false stop buttons download this game. If you like watching adverts after every hand download this game. If you like loosing to a rigged game download this game. Unless you pay you have to watch adverts after every hand. The game seams to have pre determined winners. Some players just constantly pick up wild cards and pass them on. Can play 10 hands in a row and loose every one? In real life this does not happen. The AI is tipped in the games favour.
"Good game however too many ads and it feels like teammates are chosen to make you lose in order to incentives the buying of coins, find myself waiting to get 200 coins to play the 1 game Ads that provide the coins also tend to not allow you to claim until you rewatch the ad"
"Game not bad, but when u want to play, you press start comeback same player who make you loose, should be a place to cancel middle of the game. Some are useless to play with them, they don't play as team ,this is annoying me.I know there is a place you can choose whom you want to play with. I wish to call stupid the one i play with, but the word is not there. They make me loose every time. Egg and tomato are not enough. I want dung 💩 to throw on his or face."
"This game is perfectly what I am looking for. However, it does have some bugs that are really annoying and make me want to leave the match because they affect my movements and make me lose the game. And if you want to play a match again, you have to watch ads, which is kind of annoying for me since some ads are kind of long and I cannot skip them. I've got to finish it first before playing a second match again."
The game has a mind of its own when you want to play it wouldnt let you start the game! I had this game ages ago but couldn't remember why I stopped playing and now I know because the game wouldn't even start. It keeps saying it's a connectivity issue even tho I'm literally typing and posting this here!
"Definitely a fun game, but the matches seem stacked. There should be a 1 in 4 chance of playing first card. Well I'd estimate about 90% of the time it's the player to my left that starts. Games that I do win seem to award in the hundreds, but games lost are in the thousands. Also appears to be impossible to complete the card collections. I think I play a lot, and don't think I've ever come close to a complete set."
I absolutely love this game and play it a lot. The reason for the 2 stars is that many of the ads are inappropriate for a game that is played by children. I don't want to see those kind of images when I'm playing a card game. Soft porn is not appropriate. I will only continue to play if those ads are banned. Love the game though
I cant play friendly more than 10 times in a day it asks me to wait for another 12 hours to play again why? We have to play as we want. fix this pls . and it will be more awesome too. I will rate it 5 stars.
"Fun game, except their ads force open pandora on your phone. You watch a pandora ad, it force opens the app, and then refuses to give you the reward for watching the ad, this has happened to me exactly 9 times now in the last few hrs"
This game is good but there's always an ad right after i play a match which gets me so frustrated and annoyed. i am playing this game to have some fun man. Let me have some fun.
This game is full of bots!!! I get one real player in 6 matches. Also it makes you lose all your money once you lost one game.
Too frustrating. So difficult to keep playing with the amount of funds available or given. Stopped playing because of that.
This sucks. 3 minute time limit on game (ridiculously short) and you get timeouts so quickly if you didn't realize it was your turn again. You basically lose if that happens. Bad uno app game
"Game is great! Did enjoy quite a bit but since lack of internet, I couldn't play properly. It's sad that it has to be online, well atleast an offline mode? That would be great! But overall I love the game."
"First of all, the game is good. But it keeps doing the same things. You win a few times then he gives you very bad cards and gives the best ones to the opponent. Then you lose more than you gain. It goes on like this and tries to trick you more. this is nonsense."
"I've never seen a more ad-riddled game. If it's not making you watch ads with the promise of coins that never come, it's interrupting the flow of matches with Candy Crush ads that hold the Uno app hostage and won't let you back in to play until you restart the app."
I love this game but the app is crashing multiple time since the last update. I can't finish a game without it crashing and it is very frustrating.
I like this game but it's sucks because there's so many ads and sometimes those ads don't have any button to go back so i need to exit this game and it's stressing me out. This game is kinda stuck too. Please do something about this.
I have a feedback on UNO universe 100% impossible to achieve complication. Not fair gameplay. Have been trying to 3 paw a level for over 2 months now!
"Ok the game graphics and style is good enough. But the reason why i rate this 2 stars is because there is a limit for playing with your friends. Plus i came to find a local, bluetooth or offline version but this popped out first so i tried it. But no, it needs internet just ti even load the BASIC content. Even Heavy storage games could load faster than your game"
"The game looks amazing, and the animation is fantastic. But the trick prompts work for me about 10% of the time. I gave up on mission three at this ledge where I was supposed to do a flip or something, but no matter when I timed my jump, it just wouldn't work. I spent about 5 minutes just retrying that specific jump to no avail. Veeeeery sloppy controls."
"The idea and everything is really cool, but the controls makes the game so bad. You can be at the accelerate part and if you don't move your finger in a perfectly straight line he will either slide or jump. Then 9 times out of ten when I go to jump he just stops running and I have to start all over. Lastly, when you are at the parts to do those special moves you can swipe at the perfect time and then they still don't do it. It gets irritating."
"Okay, this game is great. But, it's way too glitchy and hard... I've played rage games easier than this... 3/5 storyline, great details for it, but pretty unoriginal. 3/5 gameplay, every couple attempts on a level, it glitches somehow. The first glitch happened on default mode lvl 2, i made a mistake by trying to climb to a window. It was too far, so i fell. It showed the enemy guy just running in place inside the building. Theres also no way to pick an easy/hard mode because the game is hard."
"Very bad control. Some tricks are just impossible to take event though I tapped on it multiple times, the characters keep missing all of them. Believe me he was on that trick and swiped up but didn't perform it. It's good but not very good in controlling and handling."
The game is good and all but the only thing that makes it bad is the controls can you please fix that because it won't work if you don't put a straight line and if you mess it up once you'll probably have to start over it's a good game and all I just want the controls to be changed
Very disappointed in this game. I was generally exited to play it when I first saw. On the second level I couldn't jump at the jump at the end. So I ended up spending time and effort to get the the impossible end of the level. Do not recommend.
"This game gets you hooked. Believe me, its great. You should definitely try it, but then the problem starts. It makes you believe it is a seamless experience, and i was fooled into it too. But it is quite opposite. When I swipe up, many times instead of jumping, the character slides. The experience is very bad. Also, when the hunter makes a mistake and we leave him behind, he suddenly teleports near to us, as a debug."
"To get all the stars for each level, you have to do ""tricks"". The second level asked me to buy a trick before I started but I didn't have enough currency. It's the second level. This could have been worked around: comple the level, now you can replay it and do tricks to get all the stars"
"It's too hard U have to get 3 star before u can unlock and the worse part is, u can't use coin to unlock another level 😔 I don't spend time on games like this"
"It's a very fun game but there's many problems, for example the game restarted my phone on multiple occasions, then twice the game has deleted all my progress, not just a couple levels, I was reset back to the start TWICE. Very annoying and Im deleting the app because I've noticed my phone is working far worse since I installed the game. Would recommend for people who can be bothered to keep playing the same levels over and over, otherwise don't install."
"It's a good game visually, but getting money for new skills is super hard. Not impossible, but super hard. The controls suck, most of the times jump registers as sliding down, or even slowing down. and the ending is lame. I was pissed because it took so much time to buy all tricks and complete all levels in 3 stars. Also, this game for some reason is not available in the UK play store."
the game is amazing but the controls are so bad. you can just tap the screen in the exact same place and achieve different directional movements each time. sometimes you can swipe right and it goes left or swipe up and it goes down. all this makes it extremely frustrating at time. if controls are fixed it would get 5 stars.
"Good until the second chapter. Every new level requires 3 new moves which all cost 650 coins, which is hard and annoying to get, and the cube thingies are in tricky places which you can only get by taking a different path 5 obstacles ago, which means you have to restart, and every few restarts there's a 40 second unskippable recroom ad. I will still be playing since the parkour is satisfying when it works."
"Good concept but the actual gameplay my god. You literally have to play the level multiple times to know the location of the cubes (which aren't a secret, they are needed for the game), you can't use your reflexes or instinct, you just need to play it multiple times. Also you need to remember the exact and I mean exact time when to jump on each platform if you want to get the cube, so sometimes you can end up replaying one level over 50 times. Also the controls just don't work sometimes"
Apparently this is another one of those pay-to-advance type of games much like Ghost Recon: Breakpoint. It doesn't let you play the next level unless you've obtained enough stars on each level of the story. I'd appreciate it if you can play through all the levels without having to keep grinding for cash just to unlock the level after that one. But sometimes you still need to collect money to unlock all the tricks needed to advance to the next level.
I really wish when I swipe up on the screen the dood would stop freaking sliding. and when I swipe right I wish it wouldn't make the guy stop running half the time. really aggravating when you tell it to do something and then it repeated does the opposite.
This is one of the best mobile Parkour games ever! Except for one thing. Has anyone noticed even if they do slide or jump it'll do something totally different instead?I also have an issue where even If I don't swipe or click it'll do a move like jump or slide... fix it and I'd give 100 stars but I can't enjoy if I cant control the game.
"Was fun at first but then got way too annoyingly hard, first, when the chaser is behind you it can zap you even if it is 4feet behind you, so you either need to stop this or make the electricity go from his hand to the body (to make it less confusing). Second, when i do a trick i have to time it PERFECTLY no more than 2 or 3 pixels to the left or right. Third, on one of the downtown levels it is extremely hard to get one of the little cube thingies, if not impossible. Please fix these problems."
"It's a cool concept and I remember really liking it when I was younger, but one thing I didn't remember is how poorly the game controls. There's a tangible delay from when you swipe to when the character actually performs the action. This makes precise controlling basically impossible."
"I can't find a reason for this to be good. It's a good concept, I'll give it that. But the controls are unresponsive, as it took me 12 times just to successfully back flip, and it is way to difficult, and I ended up rage quitting at level 1-4. Part of the difficulty is from the bad controls. Fix the controls, and I'll give it a 4."
"If I'm gonna be honest I had high expectations for this game because i remember growing up playing it. So I come back and this game dooky! Dont get me wrong the concept/story is great. But the gameplay is horrible. So many bugs that need to be fixed. For example, whenever you swipe up to jump there's a 75% chance your character will slide down. Before making a second game maybe you should have fixed the first."
"The concept of the game is great, but the controls are terrible! A lot of the times when I'm trying to swipe up (Jump) it registers as a swipe down (slide). It's impossible to play like that when you're on a time restraint to complete a level. There isn't even an option to change the controls to buttons. 👎"
Still not as good as it could be. Controls are fine however activating the tricks at right time seems to be nearly impossible. Most of the time my player just jumps instead of doing the trick. Tired of replaying a level to get the trick only to have it somehow not work. Especially after paying to unlock the stupid tricks! Why should I have to buy the tricks I need to get 100% on the level? Absolute nonsense.
"Dear developers, I've found an issue in Hunter Mode Story 3-3. The hunter climbs an invisible wall while vector goes up an elevator and when the hunter reaches his elevator, it doesn't go up at all. Just stays there. Unable to complete the game due to this bug"
"1. The tutorial isn't good enough for the tricks, I can't do the trick at the second level (it's bought) no matter how many times I try. If I need to watch youtube videos on how to do something in this type of game, then the game isn't good. 2. Sometimes the objects and the background get mixed up so you can miss the object you need to make an action on. Overall it's a bad user experience."
Only problem is that level 3-5 and 3-11 in hunter mode are bugged and are impossible to complete
Unfinished. This is more a proof of concept then a game. For example disabling all sound in game stills disables all background audio. What is even more frustrating and game breaking is the fact that horizontal swipes almost never register correctly usually resulting in a jump or a slide forcing the player to repeat even the simplest levels multiple times. I hope the devs give this game more attention because while it is unplayable at the moment it has a lot of potential.
Has one of the worst if not the worst controls out of any game I have ever played. The game graphics are fabulous but the mechanics are so sloppy. When I try to speed up it either jumps or slides for absolutely no explainable reason. This is a big issue and if u want more people to download your game I suggest you fix this annoying issue ASAP!
"Unfortunately the gameplay becomes quickly boring. There isn't any actual free play involved, as you are required to perform the jumps at an exact specific moment every stage in order to pass. This causes repetitive gameplay that quickly zaps the fun away. Why no bonuses? Extra speed would make the game funner. Or something that would slow down the guy chasing you."
It's a great game that is very challenging but there are major flaws. I like games that are hard but some of these Levels are impossible. Some cubes are in the worst places making it very close to impossible to get them. Some are so out of you way by the time you get back on track the hunter is directly behind you and your dead. Also the ADS! I get millions of 1 minute ads with no skip buttons after every 5-7 attempts. This was a major factor in me deleting the game. Swipesnotalwaysrecognised
"I really loved this game when i was young, and i downloaded it again yesterday, and I have OCD so i need 3 stars on all my levels. But the game keeps on getting bugs! First it started when I swipe up I couldn't get any of the tricks to work! Then when i swiped up it instead slided down! This made me really frustrated and please fix this! (By the way I have video proof of all of this happening) if you need the proof of you dont believe me or something, reply back."
Super fun game. Love it.... Except for the controls. If not for the fun factor? I would rate this one star or less if possible because of the controls. The controks almost ruin this game and that's a shame as it's fun and super addictive. (when controls actually respond) Fix the controls and you have a 5+ stat game easy.... Oh.... make this multiplayer and that would be boss!
"The gameplay is good and all but the so called 'functional' is not even in the controls everytime i try to jump it slides instead everytime i try to sprint instead it jumps the story, voice acting, animations, an parkour is marvelous but please do something bout the controls and maybe it changes not mine but others minds to play this game ok that didnt make sense at all but if you read this and understand, thank you im not saying i hate the game im just saying there are some bugs often."
"Cool design for a game. Never seen anything like it, but the controls when trying to do a skill makes you jump instead of doing the skill. This ruins the game and makes it impossible to get to different levels without buying them. Please fix this."
"It would be fun if it rewarded more reaction based gameplay. Unfortunately, this feels more like a memory game. You need to memorize the better paths and the placement of the points, or else you're going to miss a point and have to restart the entire level. Meh."
"Ehh, this game isn't for everyone. It's neat and the music is alright. But how can you perform the tricks if you aren't shown how to do them? Like a normal demonstration of the move when the trick is unlocked would be very helpful. Instead, all you get are squares that show, ""Do the trick here,"" without knowing how to actually do it. It's kind of a dumb way to present that. Tap the trick, and either read or be shown how to execute the trick. I shouldn't have to advise you that. Common sense 🤨"
"This game is nice but after 2 to 3 minutes the game says ""vector has stopped"" and I have to start the app again. For some days I played it and I reached ""Technological park"" and started playing story 3-1. But when I open it says the same ""vector has stopped"" so I thought I will restart the game but still saying ""vector has stopped"". Please, I requst NEKKI to fix this problem. Well I like your games but I have played only 2 of your games (Vector) and (Shadow fight 2)."
"Excellent concept, beautiful graphics, but I have to admit that the lag of touch recognition really kills the game for me. I'm not sure if it's just my phone or actually the game, but for how much space it takes, I was really hoping to enjoy it, but it didnt stay on my phone longer than 2 days sadly."
well it is a cool game but the game keeps crashing everytime..i dont know about anybody else but it happens to me especially if i reach the end of a level it crashes that is why i have the audacity to give it a 2 🌟. If u fix the game i will surely give it a 5 🌟 because it is really annoying how it keeps crashing all the time...so probably on the next update
i really want to like this but my enemy is faster than me not that it shouldn't be its like when I try to reach 3 stars and if make a mistake along the way I'm done for and restart collecting moves and cubes is super annoying you have to jump and climb literally perfect.. literally.. which we're supposed to have fun with the game not be a sweaty try hard and making money and buying moves is annoying and hard it's not fun..gives me headache i have to play literally perfect to go to higher levels
"I really wanted to like this game because the opening scene was amazing, but the controller are do difficult. It's like sometimes it doesn't listen to when I swipe, everything is slow and it is just very annoying. And it sucks because this game has a lot of potential, y'all just need to work on the controlles and how laggy it is."
"Controls are unresponsive. Which is incredibly disappointing because I really wanted to enjoy this game. The gameplay is fast paced and fun but whenever I jump, most of the time it just makes the character slide, and I imminently lose. At first I thought it was a user error and that maybe I was doing something wrong. But attempt after attempt proved that it wasn't just me, it was the game."
You need to fix the controls everyone is saying how you have to fix it. in being generous and I'm giving you two star because it would be an amazing game but the fact you can't control it makes the game unplayable and I will delete it as it frustrates me to play please take on board these suggestions otherwise your game won't receive much attention. Please fix this I want your game to succeed
"Great graphics, storyline, and input of gravity. It's unfortunate that I give it a two because of the controls. I suggest that you give an option for buttons. Other than that, I appreciate the hard work you give the game. Unfortunately, I will need to uninstall the game solely on the controls. I did love the game. Good job."
"Parkour games should be smooth, fast, easy to control, and with a lot of move and enviornment variety. This game is none of those things. Controls to ""use"" a trick are hard to utilize and inconsistent. The AI ""hunter"" is a good feature, however."
"The gameplay is pretty good but I hate the fact that you need stars to get the next level, it should just be completing the level before. I have also had a problem where the tricks don't work so I can't get any more stars and I'm just stuck on the first 10 levels."
The game itself was good but u have to get enough stars to unlock the next mission.that gets hard at level 11 then also it will freeze up and slow down ur whole device. But over all the gameplay was good graphics are good it's challenging but the freeze ruins the whole experience.
I always played this game a few years ago. I just downloaded it again. It absolute sucks. Whenever I swipe when the fast boost before a long jump appears It jumps and slides instead of runs faster. Improve the game.
"The game is fun, but controls are really bad. Sometimes jumps don't happen. Also after first few levels you can not complete levels if you don't know the walkthrough of entire level so you have to try so many times to know the whole path so you can complete the level."
Loved the game before but after installing it about 6 months later the jump doesn't work well. It keeps sliding even when you swipe up. Couldn't even get past the first level. If just keeps sliding when you wanna jump ://
There are bugs I found in this game:Its impossible to pass level 5 in hunter mode also in LV 11
- There are no checkpoints. You have to play the whole level again and again. - controls are bad running fast registers as slide. - Pits can come at any time and you will never even know.
"The only problem I have with this game is that it sometimes doesn't register when I swipe up to try and get a trick, and instead makes me jump. This is very annoying as I am trying to completely finish each level"
"The controls are trash, like swipe up to jump ""slides"". Vector 2 has to be better than this for 5 stars. And also level 4 of downtown, WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO GET THEIF VAULT WHEN IT IS PLACED IN THE DUMBEST SPOT ON EARTH!"
"Your controls on the game are not that good, when i go to a stunt, I do the thing to swipe, but nothing happens. Even wherever i swipe nothing happens. Also tried anytime like near,middle, and far. Please fix this"
"Nice idea but horrible, the controls slow to respond. You try to slide and the guy stumbles around, you try and jump and he stumbles, the hunters can hit you from 10 feet away, and your special abilities don't work."
The game is good and all but why is this so hard to get the new tricks like when am I supposed to jump. No matter how many time I jump I just don't get the trick... It really bugs me. If I have purchased it so I should have it throughout the whole level why do I have to jump and try and try to get it. It really is annoying.
This is real a good game but th problem is the controls its making the game boring.when it comes to increasing speed one has to use the same control way of sliding down which is so annoying.i really dont want to unistall the game but i hope you can change the controling
I have had a great time playing this though I've having troublesome time jumping for example I'm running and then the big jump but instead I slow down. I have no idea what is going on with that but thats my review.
This game was pretty good when I first started but then the game started acting up and the controls would be getting mixed up for example when I tried to run fast it would make me hump or slide making me lose and have to restart the level pleas fix this
"Honestly, the introduction was amazing but good concept, bad controls. My experience with this game was frustrating. The controls for certain moves like the backflip just wouldn't work. Overall 2/10 game"
I was enjoying the game up until story 2-8 where for no damn reason the difficulty is spiked to 100. Why would you put a level so extremely and annoyingly hard for no reason. That one level has completely ruined my entire experience and for such stupidity 2 stars seems like a good review.
"If you are going to make a game that relies on controls so much, better make those controls work properly. Graphics are good, animations are fine."
The gameplay seems great but my only issue is a big one with the swipe controls. I'm not sure if it's just me or the controls just don't work as well as they should. Either way for me this is a good game that is ruined by bad controls.
"The first time I played it it was good alright. I beat the game, everything was alright. Now that I downloaded it back, the screen frames started acting up. The characters movement can be seen one frame at a time."
"I have been playing this game for about three years and the reason I am giving it two stars is because I have completed all levels and no more levels ,tricks ,weapons etc I have deleted it"
It's a fun parkour game the art style is great and the animations are flawless but the tricks are impossible! All I am asking is to make the tricks more obvious and less impossible.
"Poor controls, slides when I jump or sprint, jumps when I sprint or slide, and overall kinda bad at what it does good... the parkor makes you feel like a bad ass but it has really bad response times."
Graphics and music are the best qualities of this game. The game play is frustrating as well as the scoring system. Too many controls are automated leaving no true control for the player.
"Game is good but the way moving to the next level is irritating , we has to collect coins to open the next level by playing the previous stage for more than 10 times which gets bored and frustating ."
"Controls are bad. The guy that chases you does certain actions way too fast and sliding makes him catch up to you, even if you do it perfectly. The star system is stupid. I've completed the missions, I don't want to do the already repetitive missions over again to get some stupid star."
I would have loved to give five stars But I'm having this problem which others are experiencing so I don't think I have much to say.
"(MEANT TO REVIEW BY 7/10/19) When I got this on the 9th of July of this year, I couldn't complain about the game UNTIL when I wanna dash forward, swiping to my right (>), it makes me slide SOMETIMES. To Shawn, it's how you swipe that makes you slide when you head to the dash section. this is still an awful game though."
"Not very responsive: swiping down causes the character to jump and whenever an action is done by the player the character is late with the corresponding animation, causing problems in the game."
Not that fun but annoying and the reason for this is some times when I tap it dosent respond and that gets annoying fast and it's annoying. At time gameplay feels very slow. Cant say the same before the second game becuase I haven't played it.
"Well, It was fun, Until the 3rd level of the downtown map came, I just feel like he's faster than you and sometimes I swipe up to jump instead it swipes down, So I'm giving this game 2 stars until you fix this problem."
"It is a good game actually because it's similar to the parkour but the control of slide, jump speed is not good because when you speed it sometime it will be turn to slide and the competitor have some like electricity in his hand when like the distance is when you stretch your competitor's and the electricity in the hands of competitor is still touch to my competitor.😤😠😤😠😤👎"
"The game is good but, why Nekki why? The whole point in playing as a hunter is to catch the thieve, not to collect the Gems hanging in mid-Air. There is no difference between playing as a hunter and as the other guy, except for the position. The Game would be much more fun if we could play as the hunter in a more badass way."
Good game but the controls are god awful and make it near unplayable. I can't tell you how many times I've slided instead of jumped because the finger registering in awful.
"Got to map 2 with 3 stars on every level and got to about level 8 on map 2 and got stuck. I couldn't get 3 stars on it, if anyone figures out how to do this let me know."
"When I try to slide, it jumps, when I try to jump, it slides. I like the game and think it's cool but when you try do do an action, it will do the wrong one. I don't recommend this game unless you like raging."
The game is awesome and interesting I really like it. I hope the data of game can be restore and can be load to google play games...to save the game. I hope you fix this problem as soon as posible to make the data of the game safe to Vector Player. Tq
I like this game.but the only thing is the control.when the instrution ask me the swipe the screen to run.i did follow.till i reach level 3.i did follow the instrution too.so i swipe the screen to run but it make me skid.i keep losing and losing just because of the control . i give up.so i delete this game.the control are terrible.
"I love this game I truly do, but in hunter 3-5 it is just not completable the elevator bugs out or you can't control your character at all. This is a shame since I spent well over 20 hours getting the 15000 points required to unlock hunter chapter 3. Don't waste your time on chapter 3 if you wanna 100% the game"
"It was previously good when it came in 7 years before..,now it just Has Adverts..and off course these people never Really Repair The Glitches in game at some hard lvls.its just not Fun anymore. Most Ly He Does Not Jump and Slides At Action and Vice Versa it keeps happening...We Lose The Game.."
"I remember this game to be fun it to be honest the controls ruined the game for me.I tryed jumping but most of the time it would slide and when I tried to,do the running and jump it would just stop completely the controls ruined the experience"
Game is awesome 👍 literally awesome but there is a problem in flips while we jump it shows us in slow motion where it really sucks and irritating where it is difficult 😡 to play the game
love the game but need to make it less tougher I keep sliding and not jumping sometimes if can fix this be awesome. and when I swipe up to jump it will sometimes slide?? same goes for swiping up
"Yo, you need to have a tutorial or special swipe combinations to activate the new stunts we are acquiring and how to get the stunts on maps passing through them aint getting them."
The most sucks game ever I played. The skills is good but the problem is we controlling the character or A.I controlling it? Cannot gain speed and the other stuff was so expensive. I'm out now.
"I'm really upset with this game cause I expected more. The hinter always catches up with you no matter what, u have to buy each level which is hard, plus the backflip doesent even work. Plus the controls do thier own thing so its ridiculous plz fix it"
"Awful controls. If you try to sprint, you end up sliding. Try to slide, you end up jumping. The only good thing about this is the animation. Completely horrible game."
The hunter is way to fast compared to the character and almost everytime I try to jump it slides and it doesn't pick up the skills... ever.
"Control is the cornerstone of any game. This game has plenty of potential, but I just can't invest in one that has controls as terrible as this one. Uninstalling."
"Fun but when ur the hunter and u do everything that vector does sometimes its not the same and thats why i rate it 2 and when u need to buy tricks u need to do the other level over and over again and its so annoying and pls just make the reward more higher and at the gear shop it says u can buy ""Pants,Hat and scarft"" so if u cant buy all of them then what is vector wearing on his bottom part ??????????"
Do you know why I had left another three....bcaz this app makes me irritated...there will be 2 notification's only(😤) when at the time I keep my phone for charging... what's this...but the game is very cool and amazing tooo ...please fix this bug.
Bug fixes ? Nooo I got bugs which didn't exist before this update and now I am struggling to beat the hunter level cause the camera angle changes along with fps stutters .why ?it was already perfect I cant even go back to the previous version .
Pretty fun game although the main flaw is the controls tend to slip up a bit like when I want to jump it slides so if they added more control options it would be better
Ugggh i enjoyed it but the music is way to repetitive. Outa the whole game i can name 5 soundtracks that play. I need to hear alot more and diffrent music.
"Non-responsive.I swipe up,he slides.I swipe sideways,he jumps.I swipe perfectly on the tricks and it doesn't go through the animation,he just jumped and I get caught."
"It's a great game overall, but I'm honestly done with the whole bluetooth problem. This has been an ongoing problem for a year or so, and has yet to be fixed. The output audio can not be changes, which is truly infuriating, because the default (on mobile at least) is the phone output, and I would like to connect my earbuds to it. It infuriates me knowing I basically can't play this game, because I'd rather not disturb my peers. Please fix this, because I believe I've waited long enough."
"I like all the games. But some don't show up, even if you search for them. And it drains my battery faster than any other app I've downloaded. Chat filter needs to be toggleable, or customizeable. It sometimes forces me to leave a server because of a number of bugs that can occur which make it unplayable, such as shoving the screen halfway up the screen so I can't see anything."
"Good game for people who don't play on chromebook. Otherwise, it's not so great. not only can chromebook users not even scroll down, let alone going in shift lock, but after just a few minutes of playing on a game, the screen turns grey and kicks us out. Not to mention the fact that it usually thinks we're playing on mobile, and won't let us move anything. We can't join private servers unles a friend is playing in them, because we can't scroll down. Would love to see this get fixed."
"It would seem they still haven't fixed the problem with Chromebooks crashing and freezing up while playing the game. When this happens, I cannot turn the Chromebook off at all... all I can do is sit and wait. This is rather infuriating as I have spent a good amount of money on Roblox, and I can barely use it... With that being said, when it doesn't crash or freeze up for Chromebook users, it is actually quite fun, many different things to do."
"I like the game but there are a few problems about it, my screen would freeze at any game i would play,sometimes it would zoom in and out, the joystick would sometimes lag,and same with the other reviewers. Roblox is the only app ive been lagging, ive tried other apps to play or watch and it was fine, roblox please fix this. there are no problems with my internet. still not fixed"
It is a very fun game but it is very glitchy and it is really slow although the games are very good but it just is very slow literally everything cost robux so it is very hard for me to get my character to look how I want her to also when you buy a tool on that game as soon as you leave you have to buy it again. I think there should be a game to get robux. Other than all that I love all the games 🎮 😘💕
"I have benn playing this game for a really long time now, and just recently i have switched to a chromebook. The game as always was a bit buggy but since the laptop was new i didnt think much of it, now with having some time pass by, i realised the game is just super laggy, choppy and always kicks me out. and i know its not the laptop and on every other device it works just fine. Please fix this issue."
I have been playing roblox for 4 years and back in 2020 it was very smooth and great gameplay but know I can't play any games not even rated for all games or 9+ games or 13+ games so pls fix this issue as soon as possible!!!! And after updating the app it still does not work! Even if it is just my device I still love roblox but I can't play it and my avatar does not appear in some games but other then that roblox is a great game it can be laggy or buggy but that's fine pls fix this issue.
"Extremely Laggy and Glitchy on a samsung phone. Everything tends to freeze, or just be VERY slow. For some reason its only on a Samsung since when I play on a PC its perfectly fine. If Roblox can fix this issue for Samsung mobile players that would be appreciated and i'll give 5 stars. :)"
"Good games and all but, on my pc I can't play because of an error that wants me to ""memory dump"" and I've heard everyone talking about it and they said they've reported it but nothings been fixed. It's happening for alot of people. Used to be a 5 star but this new bug won't even let anyone do anything."
Amazing ideas and games. The only thing is the control.. absolutely terrible 😞 was having fun but trying to control the view while walking sucks! Make a permanent control option for the games? If your actually reading this please consider. thanks
On the mediatek mt8183 the game textures flicker and most of the time the entire world flickers. My only issue is the flicker of the game and if they just optimize the game for mt8183 then the game would be a 5 out of 5. it runs good when lowering to 3 bars graphical settings but wish they just fix the flickering on the mediatek mt8183(hp chromebook 11a).
"All I'm really going to say is that I'm a pc palyer who is now using chromebook because my laptop broke. The overall roblox game on my old laptop was a 5/5 experience, but my chromebook has issues. The chat and shift lock don't work, and I can't move around with my keyboard. Also, if I scroll too far to one side, my cursor gets stuck and I have to turn mym ouse the other way. I would have to say this is about a 1.5/5 experience now bevcause of the issues my chromebook has with it."
I've used Roblox before but stoped playing but now I've started playing again. It was loading and letting me play before but now it takes over 30 minutes to just load on to the server. It's really frustrating that it takes that long to load. And I have full service bars and everything else works on my phone but not Roblox. I've deleted it and then download it again but it's still messed up. Maybe it's just my phone but it isn't working for me😠😐
"Not really the best because I'm always getting disconnected and I've always had these weird problems with my screen where it doesn't move or it moves while im moving my character which then causes me to leave and rejoin and always getting notified to update but, still a good app to be on to pass time"
The game is fine and entertaining my favorite being blox fruits. I use to have another one but it can't be played on mobile which sucks. But the biggest one is the freezing making 2 of the games I use to grind unplayable because I'd freeze in the loading screen and my phone couldn't even turn off I'd have to force cut it off which makes some games unplayable but I don't have the best phone being a Motorola 4g but the only game that's fun and I can play is blox fruits please fix this.
"There is less options and many lags in mobile some of them you need to rejoin then IT works and after some time the lag come back and its so annoying so pls fix it and improve this game for mobile players pls, and the game is unavailable in some countries (for example ""Oman"") if you fixed that this game would go to another legendary level"
It has its bad things and takes me out for connection error when I don't have none. My internet is fine but everytime I'm talking with my friend in the phone while playing the majority of time it takes out of the game (specially 3008)
"I love Roblox I been playing since 2018, but there are many bugs in the game. One main bug takes away from the game...I cant play any games without getting kicked out after joining. I tried many ways not to get kicked out. I logged out of my game,deleted the app. But it still happens. Im not sure if its only me but If you cant get this fixed you will lose a roblox player."
"The game is not working properly. All games currently are glitched with you either being a noob skin and not being able to use any in-game mechanics, or you get stuck on the loading screen. I've joined many severs with other people on all devices saying that they're experiencing the same problem, so it's across all platforms. Can you please fix this? I really enjoy this game, and not being able to play it is kind of annoying."
"This game constantly asks my son to buy something and is connected right to my Google account and as easy as 1, 2, money is subtracted out of my bank account, sometimes four or five times in one day. There is no way to contact them, and they have gotten me for hundreds of dollars, no exaggeration. My son loves to play it and begs me with his cute little face not to cut the game off his account. Occasionally I give him 20 dollars as a reward to use on his game, but the game keeps asking for more"
"Very laggy,when I leave a game my home screen just turns pitch white. I have to leave and come back to keep playing, other than that I have a big problem. The update begs me to download it right, and I can't even download please fix this roblox. I would totally give a higher rating if this is fixed."
"ok let me get into the point: this game doesnt support mobile as much like it use too. really lots of bugs and, it doesnt support my wifi??? my internet is honestly working good with any other online apps/games and stuff but its not working with this one. this game is a big community i know that helping out everyone who plays this is hard but kts really hard for mobile players to properly play. please provide more support if you dont want people quitting."
"Love the game, only reasons for 2 stars is 1. Sometimes on mobile u can't see the chat. 2. On PC I can't play the game at all, roblox will not open, just says roblox is opening before closing and never coming back, tried reinstall, everything plz repost this so roblox can see this and fix it 3. Very rare bug makes me always pvt chatting with someone. Finally. Sometimes on mobile the camera becomes fixed and I cannot move it, more rare than before but still happens. Missed event to :( fix da chat"
"I love playing some Greenville on Roblox, But I never get to experience the PC version because it keeps crashing evreytime I try and play a game on my chromebook. I always have to play on my phone which is annoying. I kinda blame Google because they advertise their chromebooks as ""ideal for work an play."" Google, if your going to slap an intel celeron processor in your chromebooks, please dont advertise them for play, because it's just not going to work out."
"I loved this game not any problems, but when I stopped using it for awhile, and I joined a game (Evade) all I could see is is characters pure grey and blocky and didn't have any moving action. Pls update it, I'm hoping if it updates and makes it better I would make it a five star like I used to. Please, and thank you. 😌🙏"
"I love this game but... There's a bug on the game on screen that I can't rotate, and there's a rude player which is slenders and bacon hair beginning to be rude too. There's a hacker, scammer and etc. But can you please fix the bug on the the game so we can play better and I will give you 4-5 stars soon..."
"The game is so fun, but if you play on laptop then you cant scroll down to see the games and it kicks you out of almost every game. For example ive tried playing royale high and bloxburg but it just kicks me out. Even if i close out and join back it does the same thing. Its just not the same as mobile. I cant go on the website because i have a chromebook and chromebooks doesnt allow games so i have to install them."
"Ok, good game, but it won't let me sign in on my Xbox because ""something is wrong with communication with roblox servers."" Please fix this sometime soon. Also, I see you have fixed bugs and other stuff, but my problem with Xbox sign in still won't work. It has almost been a year since I last tried to log in on roblox on my Xbox, and I STILL can't log in because there is a problem connecting to this sever so just fix that please"
"This is absolutely appalling I've only had my account for about 7 days and I have already lost it to a technical glitch, I tried signing in with my character that I paid money to obtain with and now it won't even let me sign in with the character, it keeps showing two different and not my character which is ridiculous, give me my account back or this game never gets another penny from me."
"Ok this game works on an iOS device, on this phone that I'm using it's sooooo bad like when I join a game the internet signal appear on the screen and just kicks me out from the server. Overall this has been a great game like I love it but like I said very great on iOS device. Oh and 1 more thing u have to stay close to internet And this is just sooo laggy"
I like it. Nevermind when I wrote this I was just a kid but now I've been experiencing much more problems with follow due to all these updates now from a five to a three im only giving it a three since roblox has been apart of my childhood for 4 years and it can be fun to play. Another two years later and it's still terrible
"currently can't enjoy the game in mobile, for one the new update somehow ruined walking, at times while panning the camera the player stops moving, also the catalog is still a pain to navigate, it loads really slowly and group clothings have to load in the catalog wasting so much time."
"I mean~ It's ROBLOX. It's a great game on my PC but ever since my PC broke, I had to play on Chromebook and it was a horrible experience. The game always crashes and freezes up, and when it does work, the game is really laggy."
"I used to say roblox was cool. I don't know what happened. The economy is sorta weird, but it's alright, then we've got the Please rate my app after I already did. Plus, everytime I try to get into roblox, I've to close out the app and restart it for it to load. Plus if I play a game like, ""Find the Chomiks"" it crashes. Even with the bad version of find the chomiks, it still crashes, same with other low res games. My storage is fine. Please fix this, and the screen bug. 2 stars."
"I hate the new rules, i understand that you guys want to make the game safe and all but removing games like murder mystery 2 is just unacceptable also about the removal of clothes such as bikinis and crop tops are not inappropriate content because bikinis are swimsuits and are used to roleplaying games for going swimming same goes for crop tops they are used everywhere in the world and is not inappropriate, i suggest that you should just check every clothing or game to see if anything is bad."
"The reason why I gave it a 2 star is that it's a complicated game and makes me angry like I contacted roblox support and they sent me an email saying someone else's name like ""Gro"" and ""Flora"". What is this? And also don't get me wrong it's a nice game but I can't play games anymore because it randomly put my age limitation of the game age for everyone and put the authenticator app even though I didn't put it and it's annoying before roblox was simple. now it's complicated and weird. am i wrong?"
"I've played the game since 2014 i like the game I've played it on Xbox and PC and now on mobile but there are a few problems it kicks me from the game saying that same account was launched from another account making me have to change my password every day and it's kinda annoying. I also got banned for standing up for myself, and telling my little brother to go to bed. I wonder if you have 11 year olds working for you some times I'd give it 4 stars but just no."
"Stick to Desktop Roblox. Roblox Mobile, after recent updates, has become effectively unplayable. With a slightly low end device, Roblox will always kick you out of an experience within 5 minutes and blame it on ""Check your internet connection"". Would not recommend Mobile, but however would recommend Desktop or high-end (good performance) devices. I hope the Roblox Developers finally take action against this bug."
"The concept is great and i love it so much. And I've been a player since 2019 but since the latest update, I've been experiencing there has been alot of bugs on the game lately and also it lags sometimes and it freezes most of the time and also the camera sometimes get stuck"
"Its just cool and fun and they put a lot of hard work into the game its a very creative idea and game. But one problem is that the game keeps on DISCONNECTING me from the game and it's a little Laggy and I hate that they added the ""shirt"" feature because when I put red shirts in the catalog it puts 3D shirts and that's annoying. Also when I put black classic shirts it STILL PUTS 3D SHIRT'S. Fix it please"
"This is a fun game and I love to play it. There are a few big problem though, some games I can't even play or my phone will crash and I have to turn it off and back on. Sometimes it glitches really really bad. When I try to update the game, it says something went wrong or my storage is full (and it's not). I really wish they could fix it!"
"It would be good, if it didn't randomly make it where I can't play games. It will let me see the game for like 6 seconds, and then the app will restart. I've reset my phone, AND hard reset it. None of them work. ROBLOX if you reply, please tell me how I can fix this. Thanks."
"I was able to fix the problem, but for some reason, the app won't allow me to wear any old items or things I bought. It allows me to only wear new ones. If I have a item on, it will disappear, making me frustrated. I reopened or tried waiting, it still dosnet work. I believe almost half of my stuff is content deleted. Please fix this."
"This was orginally a 1 star but i added another star for the gameplay. If you didnt know, Roblox is a really fun game! The only problem is the unbothered bugs just there. Just imagine, a multi billion dollar company refusing to fix some bugs that are mildly annoying or really trash to the game. There are too much bugs you would think of. The updates dont really do anything. Fix it or not. We will continue to ask to fix it."
"I can't explain. What i feel playing this game, actually on first i thought it's great game but not. I encountered that it has a lot of bugs, ALWAYS, but tho maybe i'm only. But, sometimes bug gones, and tho- it's so annoying everyweek/everyday it has updates! Causing bugs. Update says bug fixes, BUT. Wasn't fixed, just been more than early. Not only bug is my problem. Even tho.. there alot of players is annoying i had alot report but nothing happens, nor replies or review Not that good but fine"
"I really like playing it on my laptop but for some reason on my phone it wouldn't let me in because it was due for an upgrade, so I made it get an upgrade and when it finished I went back on and the servers weren't working, so I tried retrying but it didn't work. I hope it gets fixed so I can change this. (It was an connection error even tho I have internet..)"
It's really annoying when I'm playing a game and the joystick and the jump button are so small so it's either I jump but don't move and instead I move the screen it would be appreciated if the size of those could be changed to be alil bit bigger so people that have bigger thumbs can play better with having the trouble of that all especially when playing on a phone ofc or maybe if that happens for people that play on ipads but over all except that all its a good game and runs good
Its extremely laggy on chromebook and kicks you out on almost every game with good graphics. Even if it doesnt kick you out it still is very laggy and it will be impossible for you to play. My rating would be higher than a 2 star if they fixed the problems for chromebook players.
Good app besides the CONSTANT UPDATES. & The constant unfixed glitches. The lag the kicking you out of games. And all that other stuff :) edit: you still didn't fix some bugs and issues like the one whenever you try to turn u zoom in or when u try to move ur camera follows the movement of the joystick
"Too buggy on samsung devices. Sometimes the camera locks itself and stops working, or either the joystick starts acting as the camera. The graphics aren't very great neither bad, but on my S10, everything a few meters away from my character is blurry, or either pixelated, even with full graphics settings. The GUI is pretty smooth, but sometimes I find them too big or too small in some games. Due to having a phone, the game forces you to have 3 inventory slots, which limits gameplay."
"The game since about a week ago has slowly lost functionality making simple things with workarounds not work to, like right now, not be able to open the game. It started when the Home page wouldnt load and a few other small useless things also didnt load. It made it hard to play games I've already and i cant search up games as it also doesnt load. AND NOW i am greeted with a ""We could reach our servers"" message. Retrying wont work. Reopening game wont work and neither will restarting my phone."
"All the events are just music concerts for the most part, and if they aren't it's a name brand event. Not only this, but technically robux is worth more than USD. As example $1 (100 cents) can only get you 80 robux which is a little strange. Some other honorable mentions are: terrible moderation and constant server problems. Edit: There is also constant glitches on mobile for example when walking it zooms your camera in often. They know this exist but it would cost them money to fix it."
"Ok, either you're not reading my replies or you like neglecting your app version of Roblox. Because I really don't like the constant crashing that will even cause my mobile device to crash and turn off on it's own because of how big the data is for the game. Either fix this or the 2 will eventually devolve into a 1 star. Because this is not okay you can't be having this game causing an actual system crash!!!"
"This is a very fun gaming platform and millions of games to play. There is just one problem with this one from google play store, lagging. This game takes up alot of storage and it is hard to even get into a game without it takes 5 minutes. Unfortunately, this game can make your whole device laggy and it's not fun. Please try to fix this."
"Was a very good platform for games made by the people in the community, which are great despite minor lag. But now, i can't access the actual app because it keeps restarting my phone! This happens to a few other people as well. I can't play on Roblox often on my phone anymore because of this since late Oct 2022. My phone is alright but this hasn't happened before then! The actual Roblox platform is just seeming to get worse..."
"the game is really laggy and when im playing on chromebook the mouse does not work, and you can only use so much screen. Sometimes the game just crashes for no reason at all, also you can't move after typing a message unless you press enter, alot of times the camera gets stuck in one spot and you cant possibly play the game at all. Very disappointed please fix these bugs."
"I had this for ages, and I don't play it much anymore. When I do try to engage and open it, the game will lose connection or crash randomly. There are also lag and glitches with my camera angle and in general. They never had this issue until recently last year or so, and it's just getting worse now."
"It has some fun games but it crashes waaaay to much for me to enjoy it, also can you make console more playable? Like I would definitely like to talk in chat with others, also add a servers list so I can join other servers that don't have many people in them, and make it to where we can add others on cross platform so it's more playable"
"Every time it needs an update, I update it but it's not working and I have enough space ! Instead of higher starts am giving you guys a 2. For that reason this game has laggy, glitchy and it makes you rage completely! And if you could fix any of these problems it'd be nice. Thanks to you if you do ❤️"
"Having a MAJOR issue with my attempts to first redeem a gift card, then to add money to purchase Roblox. It keeps telling me to add Google Play payment. I have and it won't let me purchase. I am seriously frustrated! It didn't use to be this complicated."
"I'm saying 2 stars because when i try to get in the platform it doesn't load and i have to try a few more hours and sometimes that doesn't even help, issue is it doesn't load anything and it doesn't let me load into any of the games when the home screen is done loading it only works as if it had a mind of it's own"
"It's annoying that sometimes when the screen can't move, but if it happens just press the roblox icon on the top left corner and it'll be fixed. Hackers too, It's unfair for other people and it's annoying."
"This game isn't as fun as it use to be. Everytime I try to join a game it takes 30-40 minutes tops to load in, my wifi is pretty good AND I use mobile data. My phone is only 3 months old, and Roblox still moves slow as a turtle on the highway. I'll bring up my rating after this is fixed"
"Its so fun and you can friend people and there are so much games that you can play. Edit: The only thing that I don't like about this game is that the avatar clothes and hair styles are not nice, that are for free. Please improve this edit 2: still haven't changed a single thing and it's still laggy"
"I have good internet and its a fun game! But it always lag and glitch then I get disconnected randomly for nothing! Sometimes I can't enter this game, and somedays when I move my camera moves and its super anoying and when I finish something nothing happens and I don't earn robux sometimes if I join a obby I get teleported into another obby."
It's good but they have changed alot that most people don't like like the oof sound and they have made realistic ppl most ppl like the original characters I personally hate the realistic ones (not realistic) it would also be good if they also made games cos most ppl have played most of them and get bored and don't know any other games they like apart from that it's a good game you play with friends and the games on the game a very good 😊😊
"Blox Fruits: Could the developers consider a different strategy for ""dropping fruits"" within this specific game. There has been a recent influx in the amount of times people's fruit are being stolen - not when the character dies, but specifically when ""dropping"" to another user. This is causing some distress. Could we propose ""Gifting fruit"" directly to another user through ""tagging"" or ""assigning"" via the inventory as an example. Happy to elaborate. Really cool game - this is just :("
"I bug out of games constantly it is very buggy and overall very hard to play. I enjoy the game alot but i can't when it kicks me out of the game. So please respond and do a bug fix. Thank you, Roblox"
"Roblox is fun, you can play with friends and other games that are amazing to play. Ever since the latest update, Roblox is just unplayable on any mobile device and you NEED a computer to play it so it would load graphics faster and not lag. UPDATE: nothing is fixed and roblox decided to scam my money by not giving me my robux"
The game is great but I would like to say some problems. First: When you increase your graphics it starts to be laggy Second: sometimes people behave badly a little Third: many people play on mobile and roblox is miserable at mobile Fourth: there are bugs and glitches Please make the game better it doesn't taste all of this maybe the reasons might look stupid but fix it 🙏
It's so laggy wonderful game but it just makes me mad most of the time I love all the detail that goes into every game it's just there's really a lot of bugs and it kind of ruined the experience if it wasn't like this it would be five stars some of the things that happened to me while I'm playing a game is my screen will randomly not let me zoom in or out or turn to look at another Direction other ones are like it won't let me jump or walk I'm a mobile player so it's kind of hard to play :(
"In roblox the moderation is bad, but there is some fun games to play. Also there are a lot of visual bugs for example on some old huawei devices the games parts start disappearing and the reappearing again rapidly."
"I've been playing since 2020,and roblox has been laggier as soon as i play a game, my connection and phone is great,yet am still lagging,i have tried a booster, still laggy, i don't know what is wrong the app or my connection,i am pretty close to my router yet lagging, please fix it,hackers are still pretty easy to find, slenders and dating isnt, so i have seen great and worse progress in this particular app,also honorable mention, the fact that the friend joining system is sometime is broken"
"it entirely depends on what you play. some games are actually really good and worth playing, while others are absolutely terrible. the moderation system is absolutely disgusting, no matter what you do, the infractor will get away with it 90% of the time. incompetent employees and easy-to-break rules. if you have a child, do NOT let them play. this is a pedophilia hub, and your child is an easy target. only let your child if they are above 13."
"i love the game so much but on chromebook it crashes and lags alot and often freezes and wont even let me turn my computer off, sometimes it crashes that bad my computer doesnt turn back on and i have to wait a day or two to turn it back on so it works."
Overall worked for me for 5 years then suddenly games stop working such as adopt me and Brookhaven same thing with my cousins so far two games have stopped working and it's getting to a point where I'm going to delete Roblox because if all my favorite games get canceled then there's no point in playing because I'm not going to play a game that I'm not interested In. Hopefully Roblox can fix it but until now my review stays at 2 stars.
The game is very good but it's unplayable. There's always pop up that says connection error and we are experiencing technical difficulties even tho my wifi is good.
"Have experienced non receival of robux through premium membership, made numerous attempts to contact help in app and through Roblox customer service number. Made attempt today to contact developer after canceling premium membership since it's due for payment again today and do not want to pay for nothing in return. Game is glitchy in many areas but my son still loves the game regardless."
"Having fun so many games and you can play anywhere The problem is that when you play games on roblox, the screen suddenly freezes, then the screen always plays tricks on roblox, then when you walk, there is also a problem."
"A lot of the games have a horror theme that is inappropriate for little kids. While you can choose settings to limit content, the app still shows the games as an option, rather than just showing approved games for the age rating. Also, the games don't seem to be regulated very well as some of the inappropriate games slip through. I don't think I'll be letting the kids have this app for long."
"not very good, laggy, glitchy, and way more i can list off, like whenever im in a game it just disconnects randomly out of nowhere + the “SaMe DeViCe LaUnChEd aT tHe SaME tImE„ like can you shut up? and the lag, oh my god dude, what in the actual hell? the only thing i like about this game is just no ads, and the lack of features on mobile, cant even play a simple damn game because of one feature (and the buttons in the most stupidest places), please fix these issues, even if it breaks roblox."
Ig its a good game. Not very fun without friends. There are hackers and scammers on the app so be careful. When you buy clothes with the game currency and they get deleted you don't get your money back. Some games also don't give you your money back if they delete a game pass. There is a lot of online dating and most of them are kids. Though the game needs a lot of work done its good.
"Aight, game won't open, there is always a connection error, everytime I log in it just says ""something went wrong try again later"" . I checked my internet and it's good, it's fine yet Roblox refuses to open or connect. Assets are not loading properly now."
"Good game but the fact some games aren't mobile compatible isn't really fun as you have to switch over to a PC, second reason is the lag. No matter what device it is,, you lag. Third, one of my accounts have been ban for no reason which I found strange. Fourth, some of my clothes keep getting deleted, mainly some new ones I bought recently. And lastly, Online daters and scammers. I've been in many servers, the first thing I see? Heat/online dating and scammers. Wish they'd get banned."
I think that this game is cool but the none stop updates and glitching could be better but I feel like it's entertaining and fun to play when bored. All though I haved this app for at least 3 years and the glitching and not responding to the game has been the worst the game completely stopped working on my phone
"Love the game but OBVIOUSLY this game sucks on a chromebook like almost every other game. Your sweaters will come off during certian games, it is glichy half the time and sometimes the settings don't work. Still confused why they hype a Chromebook up when the games are THIS BAD."
"Too many updates, I'd rather use the web version but it doesnt give you the maximum opportunities as it does on PC. (Also the game has gotten massively boring recently during 2022 and 2023 especially)"
There are a lot of issues. EVERY SINGLE SATURDAY the entire platform goes down because of ONE game. Roblox needs to resolve this. There are just WAY too many glitches and it's basically unplayable for mobile players. It's incredibly difficult. Often the games kick me out on my IPad mid-game.
I this game it's really fun. But sometimes the game the game lag or glitch and it will log me out or sometimes I can only zoom in and I can't move my screen sometimes it would just like disconnect me for no reason if I'm off like 5 minutes it will tag it would make tags whenever I put something normal but it's really fun game and also sometimes I act like upgrade it after I just upgraded it but yeah I gave it a three-star cuz it's fun
This game is so bad for mobile unless you use PC the lag is annoying and in game like blox fruit if u go from four bars to three bar then back to four the game crashes and it can't be fix unless you rejoin which is furtrating and sometimes you just lag and can't access anything on ur phone for a while so annoying the problem needs to be fixed
"Horrible on phone. On every other device I don't have a problem with disconnecting, but on phone, I disconnect every less than goddamn 10 minutes. And can we talk about how your game is cursed. Uninstalled it once and my phone froze and wouldn't turn back on for like half an hour. Switching games will absolutely DISTORT earbud audio and the app will not hesitate to restart your phone if you somehow manage to run a game for more than 20 minutes. FIX YOUR GAME ON MOBILE."
"I love this game, however, this is only on mobile, and I keep glitching out in certain games OR my camera gets stuck where I have to leave and join back in every time. Now back to the glitching, when I play a certain game like hello kitty cafe, puppet, ect, I join, it's completely normal, when I join a different part of the game or die, it randomly glitches me out to the point where my screen is stuck at the home screen. Please fix this! It's really annoying, I would give it 5 stars if you do!"
"Honestly I don't see why I still play it, it's too laggy, even in the low quality games with no graphics it still lags. I have been kicked out of multiple games just for lag. Just last week I went threw all my storage and cleared about 20 GB, but it still runs the same, with lag and all. ITS NOT FUN!! I CANT PLAY LIKE THIS, AND THE UPDATES DONT EVEN DO NOTHING, THEY JUST MAKE IT WORSE, IF THIS GETS FIXED I MAY RETHINK, BUT FOR NOW I'M UPSET ABOUT THE LAG, FIX THIS!!!"
"On my opinion, this game is nice but there are a few things that irritate me 1. I got banned for 1 day for nothing I was just chatting with my friend in the game chat and it banned me for saying ""it doesn't let me"". 2. When I die the camera changes. Like when I die in an obby, the camera mode changes from default to something irritating. 3. The net. Yes, the net. EVERY SINGLE GAME IS TAKING SO MUCH NET. Even if it was a 1 player server it takes so much net and my 2gb is lost almost instantly."
"Personally, I really enjoy roblox but I'm experiencing an issue. I'm my phone, I can't login to my account. It says something is wrong please try again later. I checked and my phone isn't any of the phones that were discontinued on roblox. I thought it was just like that for an update, but It just updated and it still won't work."
I love the platform but the problem is that the games would glitch amd kick me out of the game and bring me to the Roblox loading screen. It even signs me out. My cousins even get upset when I can't play the same game same them because it either glitches then kicks me out or is just kicks me out immediately. This just makes me mad 😠.
The play part is great but it's very hard to make your own game and clothes/accessories I think it should all take place in Roblox and be able to make a game with help coding or a tutorial for it I really want to make my own game and clothes/accessories but can't because it needs something else or it's to complicated so please make it easier for all of us (I was going for two and a half star but I can't)
This is very bad it used to be good but nowadays its kicking me out when I try to play it! Okay maybe if you made it less laggy I would like it but yeah. This ruins my gameplay whenI play it to which makes it even more bad! As a result I do not like it what's even worse is for some reason you have to spend money to get robux. The games are good this is not to the developers of the games on roblox. All I'm saying that roblox is very laggy! Maybe if you add something can give you atleast one robux
"It's good and pretty fun , But I've having a problem since these days , The Roblox can't let me play and it says "" connection error , Unable to contact server. Please check your internet connection ! "" And my brother is telling me it was just a lag/bug please tell me if it was a lag or a bug , And if it was how can i fix this??"
"You can join a co-op, meet people from all over the world, compete in regattas and events, and build your town. Edit update: the game is not nearly as fun as it used to be. If you don't play the mini games, you don't earn enough points to win the golden ticket final prize. The mini games are difficult, boring and repetitive. Even 1/3 of regatta tasks are for the mini game. I've asked customer support several times to drop the mini games or bring back some old ones. Nothing changes. Down 3 stars."
"Used to be better but the mini games have monopolized it. They take too many of the regatta tasks. I never play them, they're boring, repetitive, and frustrating. I wish they'd bring the regatta task icon back. You have to keep jumping back to the regatta to track progress. There used to be more player interaction outside of the co-op but those activities went away. Lastly, the holiday town decorations are gone and those were nice. Long time player, but miss the older versions so much!"
"I got stuck on level 45 in the mini game. It's impossible to pass in 18 moves. Barn seems to always be an issue of always being full. The game is more frustrating than fun. The concept of the game is amazing but you get stuck early in the game taking away the experience. The train system is too slow for upgrading community buildings, impeding town progress. It started out real cool but becomes infuriating early on. I can't imagine how upsetting it becomes further on. Waste of time and money."
"Was fun. They have become so monotonous with the mini games and events. They took away the cute decorations for holidays. Now you have to pay and they aren't as good. The mini games used to have variety but now it's the same 3-4 rotated. Bring back the regatta task counter and the completed task check above the boat. When I play the mini games, my touch screen stops working periodically and I have to leave the game to fix it. I've contacted support multiple times with no resolution."
"I'm seriously getting annoyed with the mini game play having every other level be a hard or super hard level. I can't compete for anything like the farm races or ernie's cup because those levels are ridiculously difficult AND more frequent the higher you level up. I agree with others that if you purchase a golden ticket, you shouldn't lose all of your barn upgrades at the end of an event. Half maybe, I get it, it's an expiring event. And i call BS saying you're working hard to make changes."
"I have played for years, and it has been fun. But, recently, the seem to have run out of ideas for prizes and side games. For a cpl years now, all the regatta prizes have not changed. And, the mini games have lost their appeal. For me at least. The new merge game on now, for 20 plus days!, is quite boring and just repeats the same merges over and over. It takes so long to unlock some other merge item. I still like this game, I hope they can come up with more fun ideas for minigames."
"I enjoy the game except having to play an extra side game for tasks. Building materials need their own storage. Especially since we have to save up a certain amount before we can spend it. Most importantly, and the reason I want to quit this game is that if I pay for a golden ticket and get extra barn space, I should be able to keep it. I paid for it. Taking it away is a greedy move, and that's putting it nicely."
"I paid for the golden ticket, and since the mine event, the game has been frozen for me! Took my mining equipment, money I received from treasure chests, and gave me nothing but frozen! I can see the trains roll in, but the border is completely unresponsive to interaction. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared cache, etc. Nothing works. I don't know what else to do. No response to emails nor tech support either. I'm definitely frustrated with the whole situation here!"
"The game randomly stopped working. It won't get past the load screen and just crashes every time. Fully updated , plenty of storage . I played fine for a few mins yesterday and now it just won't open. Support was a bot and zero help. Edit : if I can get it open, lots have a loading sign on them . It still crashes often though, with the new Easter update. Reply to the reply; I've stated that I've done both and it hasn't fixed anything."
"I have mixed feelings about this game. It's awesome that there are so many different parts to it, but when they say the mini games are hard or super hard, they mean they are near impossible. As you go along, they also become more frequent. They want you to buy stuff. Getting started is tough; your barn is ALWAYS full at first. Even now, it's almost always full. The mini game they show in ads is VERY rarely played."
"This is the only app on my phone that heats up my phone so badly that my phone turns off on me. Then I'm not able to turn it on for about 10 minutes. I try to play as fast as I can before it happens again. Some of the mini game levels are so hard to pass. They don't give you enough moves. It makes it almost impossible to pass unless you spend money or use all your power-ups. I have since started to not play as much. Since downloading the app,my phone doesn't keep its charge as long as it used to"
"Disappointingly expensive in cost and effort. Mini games ramp up in complexity too fast, time and costs of activities are too expensive to enjoy without either playing mini games that pay out too little per game to go forward, or spend money to buy the material to move forward. I only made it to 14 before I gave up because it was just discouraging"
"I used to love this game, or at least the town parts. I was never particularly crazy about the more traditional match three subgames which were just designed to make you spend real cash. But there was a technical issue with the game which has halted my progress, and it's almost impossible to get any sort of tech support, etc. I have enough trouble tracking down people to do their job in the rest of my life, I don't need it in my recreational time."
"The perks aren't as good as before on this Halloween event and the mini games are getting too difficult, where you have to spend money if you want to get ahead. Do better, or many players will leave. Several ppl in my co op are already getting frustrated with the level of tasks. It's supposed to be fun, not a 2nd job. Update: I stopped playing. It was getting repetitive and boring. A shame since it had great potential."
"It was pretty fun, but the mini game that is played in ads of collecting the cash and then distributing that for products to take back to customers is B.S. and not what you actually do. I actually enjoyed playing this, no matter how absolutely impossible it is to get the items you need to upgrade your barn at all. My real issue is how I wanted to play on multiple devices and now cannot access it from my main device since it's a different version, and the new version isn't available on Android."
"NOT cross-platform compatible as it claims. This game is fun and I would like to play it more. But it is a memory hog and crashes constantly. I usually play on my tablet with everything stripped off except this game and it often still won't work (especially updates). Tried to load on laptop and was told by Support different platforms, different servers. So you MIGHT be able to play on two phones or two computers, but you can't play on a tablet, then a computer then take it to go on your phone."
"1. My app keeps crashing 2. The fun in app games are almost non existent anymore. I don't care for the endless puzzle games. The roller coaster and gumball etc games are more fun to play. 3. There are fewer ways to earn in app cash than before and the games are increasingly requiring more in app cash to compete. I wish the trains brought the ""supplies"" that are needed for individual expansion. For example, I don't have any buildings left to build but I have plenty of spaces to expand to"
"Downgrading my review due to the unachievable completion of it's mini games without spending real money frequently. Highly addictive gambling like aspect to it's mini games (that require spending your money to advance), which are just their version of popular games in the play stores. Adding mini game tasks to regatta's make it less fair for the many people who don't/won't/can't play the mini games but want to compete in the regatta's like it use to be."
"A great time killer, and I played off and on for a few years, but I then realized many of the challenges were the same old same old, once all the factories and community buildings built, and mini challenges too few and far between, it went from a time killer to a boring waste of time. I would think part of the appeal of any video game is as the player levels up, the game becomes (and should) become more challenging. Which is too bad...there are little details to Township which are adorable."
"Township is very fun to play in the beginning. However, once you get further into the game, it's just annoying. It was very hard for me to balance the work of filling orders, loading trains and plane crates, finishing construction, and many other tasks. The game has real potential, and the idea is great, but it only gets more annoying as you continue -- which is the same with your games Homescapes and Gardenscapes. Graphics are good, I'll give you that. I just wish the game was better."
"Started out like a nice little game. Seemed cute - mindless way to pass spare time. Except after 10 or 15 minutes it flipped back to the train conductor tutorial, which I had already done, and I can't do anything. Tried to close the game out completely and that didn't fix it. Restarted my phone even and the gameplay jumped right back to the tutorial and froze again. This is really disappointing."
"I loved this game for several years & gladly paid for it. It was that good. I've invested so much time, energy and money into my town. I'm quite proud of it. The game didn't require hand eye coordination, there were a few puzzles but it was mainly strategy and teamwork. The original introduction of the experiments was wonderfully done and so much fun. It brought a new element into an existing game without changing the game's design. Then they started focusing on mini games. Now to get good decor you have to grind through these horrible non-township related mini games. When they first added mini games to the experiments, it was minor and you didn't have to do them to complete the experiments. But now, it's not only flipped, they've made the difficulty level so high that only those who cheat or don't mind spending hours doing the same thing over and over again will get anywhere. In order to get 1/3 of points needed to just get through 1 of the 25 stages, I have to play the friggin' mini game 200 times (400 boosts, 2 boosts each game, is 200 games, it's crazy). I am unable to play hand-eye coordination games so I don't do it and I don't enjoy them. Support has been useless, they just say ""we'll pass it along"" but nothing ever changes. Are they getting THAT much more money from these changes or something? I know not from me, I only make one small purchase a month now. It's killed the joy that this game brought to so many of us. I've continued to pay for the gold pass in hopes that this will get better, but so far, it just hasn't. I'm starting to look for another game that is what Township used to be. I don't want to play knock off frogger or a gum machine or road spans game. I installed Township - I'd like to play that game again."
I've played this game a year or so ago and really enjoyed it. Went back on recently and wow things have changed. PROS: I enjoy the side games. Kind of kills time while waiting for crops to grow or items to be made. Graphics are great too! CONS: I wish that you could do a full 360 rotation on the buildings and homes. 11/23/21 - The underwater room side game is terrible. Most levels seem to be difficult making it hard to advance to the next level.
"Use to be fun, but getting worse. This time the gem game, i got to play like 4 levels. Then a super, super, super hard level came on and i was stuck there the entire game. I didn't even get to sweep the floor. I always paid for the upgrades but... I quit paying for ""the experiments"" after the last one they were talking about score a phenomenal amount of points and beat like 30 levels in a row without dying. Just way too rediculous. Scared me and my checkbook away."
I used to enjoy this game. When the professor’s experiment was 3 to 4 times a year and the tasks included things like build a bunch of sweaters or harvest a bunch of silk there was variety and it was possible to steadily move through the levels. Since it switched to one starting right after the other it is not interesting and the all-minigames-all-the-time aspect takes away the fun. The explosive game has gotten so hard you can’t win and the sheep game hasn’t been winnable since it started. What happened to the burger building game? Other aspects have changed also. This last time there was not even a race of champions between regattas. Once all the buildings are built there is not a lot to keep someone in the game except variety. Doing the same stuff over and over again sucks.
"In the beginning it was time consuming and slow to advance. Now at level 56 it's too complicated to play and it is more time consuming. You are limited from the beginning on how many items you can have which makes it harder to play. As I said, it is too much time consuming but it is adictive game. I spent a lot of money trying to advance on those 2-3 $ purchases. I probably spent more than $150 for which I could have bought 2 PC games."
"This was once a great game! I have been playing for almost 4 years. When I started you could spend money and enhance the game play or with a little money play for special items, but you could have just as much fun if you just dedicated your time to gameplay. In the past year everything has switched from gameplay to success in the mini games. The mini games have also gotten extremely difficult to progress in without purchasing extra in game features. The money grab is becoming very annoying"
It's not a bad game to pass the time. But I don't like how much everything costs to expand and build. I'm having a hard time making any gold or cash because everything costs so much so I'm stuck. I've bought more gold and more cash from offers and packages and it was a waste. The real money cost to purchase more gold/cash is too much for the amount you get on the game. Games stop being fun if you have to make real money purchases to keep up.
"I have been playing this game for years and am at level 80 or near it. In the last few days, since the game updated from Christmas to Chinese new year, thr game crashes within a second or two of opening. Tried everything to fix the problem. Only thing to do is to Uninstall it, then download it. If I turn the game off, it crashes again. I have sent feedback to no avail."
"I've never had any problems with this game until the latest update, and I've been playing for 3 years. Now anytime I try to access the regatta to select tasks, or to collect rewards at the end, the game freezes and crashes and I get booted out. This happened several times during the last regatta and caused me to have to repeat my task several times. I also lost township cash from chests because my progress wasn't saved before the game crashed. When I ""reopened"" the chests it was something else"
this game is very detailed & oriented. I liked the game at first but the only problem is . it's a ripped off! everything required real cash to upgrade or else you're stuck! it gets boring & people can't be putting all that $ in to play a game. the purchase is too expensive too. so far I put in $20 but that's it! definitely not recommended for kids or anyone on a budget. stick with hayday!
"I have really enjoyed this game until the latest update. Now it crashes all the time. I have had to uninstall and reinstall multiple times just to save progress. Support was notified by myself and several team members. Not much has been done by support to correct the problem. Playing the team item, the regatta event is so much more difficult with the crashes that I may even quit it altogether."
"Not at all what was advertized. I downloaded the game after seeing ads where they fixed parts of a town by removing trees, putting out fires, etc. Instead I got a simple game about building a town. Its an okay game for what it is, though the wait times can be a bit long and its really hard to find item to increase your storage. But its not the game I was lead to believe from their ads."
"the zoo needs to have another short cut window, just like the transportation used in order to keep up with orders. also once you get to a certain amount of coined money, one should be able to purchase cash. This would allow for one to reach the levels they want without having to pay so much money through out the game. or have an option to out right purchase the entire game."
"I really like this game, but it keeps shuting down. Most times I will only be on it about 4 mins and it closes. I've gone thru all the steps suggested, and it continues to shut down. I've cleared the cache (many times) uninstalled and reinstalled the game and even downloaded the updated 2019 version. It's really hard to do any of the timed events or get planes loaded in time when it continually closes. If I can't get a solution soon, I'll just uninstall for good!!"
"2 years ago, I downloaded the game solely to get a credit in another game. This game quickly turned into an obsession. I loved the different levels, competitions, and prizes. Now, it feels like all the software engineers and product team quit. It's the same 2 games every few weeks and I haven't seen any variety in the competition games since last year!! We keep getting the same gumdrop, roller coaster, and the puzzle games every month?? If you're not going to update the game, update the prizes."
"I used to enjoy this game. After all I have played almost 200 days straight and currently at the level 73. But the latest update (7.8.0) was terrible. It is much slower, crush often which causing data lost and not syncing between the devices. All my co-op players have same experience. I changed to 2 stars from 5 and hope the developer can fix the problems soon."
"Game is very fun when it wants to be. Every rotating mini game is really fun except the ""puzzle"" minigames. It basically becomes impossible unless you spend cash to continue, and never gets easier. Once you reach ""super hard"" that mini game is forever that difficult, even when a new season or event starts. If this game wasn't terrible ""puzzle"" games 90% of the time, it would be really fun. But I went from someone who buys the ticket, to basically done playing in about three months. It's a shame."
"It's fun if you like to build your own place and decorate, and also has different challenges available. I like it, but I had downloaded the game because of the ads, so I was a little disappointed when it was nothing like the ads. (Update) I'm kinda addicted at this point lol, It's the only game I still play (Update) It's annoying that we can't play if we don't update the game, especially since it takes up so much space every update. My phone has a lot of space, but it's still inconvenient."
"The game is enjoyable to a certain point, then it gets repetitive. It's really frustrating that every time you level up you're greeted with even more tasks (for example, the zoo), instead of tools to help you. You'll have to log in to this game, say, every couple minutes to stay productive. It's very frustrating when your T cash disappears and they don't fix it."
Been playing for years and look forward to the seasonal events. Wish the Halloween decorations would stay around longer or start earlier. Not a big fan of how to get zoo animals. Its a decent time killer though. Would be neat it as you up your factory levels and trains they would show a different style to match the upgrades like different trains as you level up. The mini build room games have gotten near impossible to pass without spending quite a bit of money. Not as much fun as it was.
"The game starts out fun. There's always something to do and you can grow a town quickly. However, after you get higher in levels, the factory times become way too long. There's too many places to check for orders and your screen becomes filled with tabs. It got to the point I could barely see the town I was building. Also, they changed the mini-game to a type of game I do not play. Because I had purchased the golden ticket, I kept playing it. Not fun anymore! Uninstalled game! Waste of time."
has good graphics. it started off being enjoyable but then it sucks you into mini games that become difficult and a lot of mini games at 1 time. it doesn't give you enough expansion tools. it forces you to use game cash(which is hard to get)to get past levels and people get turned off by same old rewards that don't really help...finally at times just want to delete it because it stalls you out of progressing for long periods of time
"This game was fun in the beginning. However, be prepared for it to turn into a ""pay to play"" money pit! Almost every ""bonus"" costs T Cash, which you can either win (rarely) or purchase. The mini games were challenging yet fun in the beginning. Now, they have become so difficult that it again takes T Cash to get you through some levels. I'm very disappointed as I really enjoyed playing this game. I have contacted in game support twice regarding my issues/concerns, but didn't hear back."
"Downloaded based on an ad that has absolutely nothing to do with the game, which is like false advertising and totally not cool. It's pretty boring, one of those games you do stuff and wait an hour to get the rewards or shell out big bucks for less than gratifying payout. I usually play up to a certain level and delete the app, will be the same thing here."
"Uninstalled it after many years of playing, just would not save my progess. I did not like the mini games. Same ones, hard to advance. Both boats and factories take too long. Really everything takes too long to progress. It was fun to a point but you would expect improvements to keep it fun. Interesting, and challenging but that never happened."
"Love the game but the special events are not done well sometimes. Most recent color block event is terrible! Not all elements of game work, they dont give you enough of the color you need to complete a level. Makes it imposible to get stars or past the level. Makes the game frustrating so i stop playing. Not a great way to keep players. And no way to give feedback to developers."
"Okay game, but NOT as advertised Downloaded the game for my 4 yr old, who really enjoyed the ""playable ad"" we found on another game, but this game is NOTHING like the ad. It's advertised that you choose what items are necessary to fix broken roads, etc... actual gameplay is totally different. Requires lots of waiting, place buildings on a map, farm, wait forever for required items to upgrade, etc. At level 20 now, and still haven't seen the guessing game like advertised. Dissapointed!!"
Now the game won't even open. I just get a black screen. This is BS! Still getting kicked out of game when trying to access regatta. Fix the game or stop having regattas until you do. Can't get into regatta tasks. Throws me completely out of the game & I lose progress so I keep having to repeat things over & over. Problems started during upgrade. Very frustrating & unfair to my team. Been playing almost 2 yrs & ready to quit.
It's been crashing every time I try to claim my prize from the event. I've since deleted the game and reinstalled it and it was working fine for 2 days. This morning when I got on to play it starts crashing again. Please fix the issue. I really like this game and would hate to have to delete it completely. 3/7/22 now I'm having an issue with the game saying my barn is full when it isn't full at all. I had to uninstall because it is still crashing after regalia ends. It never fails to happen.
"I play this game daily and have loved it in the past, but now I feel like it's just costing too much. I don't mind paying to play, but when I have to pay in order to advance, it takes the fun out. Unlike the commenter below, I LOVE the match games, but find myself having to pay more often than not to get through levels. It wasn't like that before, but now every other level is 'hard' or 'superhard' and I can't pass without paying. Even some that aren't marked hard, I eventually have to pay topass"
"Had to finally change my rating from five stars to two after a few years playing. Also had to uninstall permanently after 3 times of reinstall and still wouldn't work properly. Enjoyed the game... until it didn't work anymore. I noticed many of the recent reviews are not very favorable... maybe it's time to back up and punt. Sad about it, but moving on to a new game."
"Pretty solid farming game with a city building aspect. The events, however, are designed so you HAVE to lose levels if you don't spend money by making some levels literally impossible to pass. I've restarted this game a few times and it's always the same in that aspect, which is frustrating as I have no intentions on spending money on this game."
"Go back to way it was before the pandemic. Professor's Experiment used to be fun. Not I feel like it's a chore. Every month a new set to buy and totally tied to the mini games which also are more difficult and require purchase to move on. Same games over and over. They took away so many fun mini games and it used to be a side option of play but made it a requirement to get new buildings. Also no new factories, houses and other things to build in years. No expansion of zoo or islands either."
"The game itself, before the constant monthly updates... is great, been playing for a few years now. The ads are not at all what you actually do in the game. The designs for the rooms or areas to complete redecorating (usually for the match tile game) take way too many tickets to complete. I was so close to finishing this and was going to take 40 levels to complete! All that for balloons and a sign?"
"This is an extremely old game, and should be very stable. However, on at least five occasions, the game has gone into a CPU loop when attempting to find pieces to move down the screen. The technical support is pathetic. It reminds me of AOL in 1994 when they only solution offered was to have you delete the program and reinstall. Eventually you give up trying to be helpful and just realize the developers are not interested in the quality of their product."
"Too many glitches with updates! It keeps freezing on me after I beat a mini game & then makes me replay it! It has nothing to do with my connection! It also cheats when I play the mini games. I'm not the only one complaining about it, so are people in my regatta. I enjoy playing the game, but I don't like being cheated on! It also is not providing the little helicopter add on when I choose it. I won 25 minutes of it, and it just flys across the game and never activates! Please fix! Thanks."
"This game keeps getting worse. I am now lowering rating to two stars. The mini games used to be fun, but now they're just too hard to be enjoyable. The new makeover mini game is no exception, and robs you of rewards you have earned. In specific, I have earned multiple mini milestones to be rewarded pink tickets, but the game doesn't actually give them to me. All of the upgrades/makeovers cost a stupid amount of these pink tickets, so it's very frustrating. I'm close to deleting the game."
"While in the beginning this game was very fun and exciting it has now become tedious and monotonous. The side games are utterly maddening. They're far too difficult to be fun. It takes way too long to pass even some of the levels that should be not so difficult. Unless you have extreme patience I wouldn't suggest this game. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it still is a little fun to produce goods and ship them off. But, even these can be aggrevating with the production times wait."
"I used to really like this game, and played it everyday. Once I started getting into the higher levels I noticed a problem.... I was able to construct buildings faster then I could expand the land. That left me with no room to create a decent looking city. It just became too crowded and looked bad. Also, the game has become too ""busy"" with so many things going on in it."
"It's gone downhill. I've played this game for 6+ years. For years it was challenging. They had new usuable gameplay content coming out regularly. That became more infrequent and then stopped altogether.. Then they ruined the zoo by making it extremely easier (and extremely less fun). Now the focus on is mini games which are boring and too hard to win (if you even care.) The only good part of the game anymore is the regatta, the graphics and the familiarity. 3 years ago 5 stars, today 2."
"Changing my rating to 2 stars. I love the game and have paid into it, but as of today I'm unable to access the Regatta. The game crashes every time I try to connect to the Task Tab. Uninstalling and Reinstalling the game does not fix the issue, neither does clearing the Cache folder. Support supposedly is aware of the issue, so I guess it's basically a wait and see game at this point. I hope the bug is fixed sooner rather than later."
"My progress was saved to the cloud and when I reinstalled the game, the progress was gone. It had my achievements on my google play account, but the progress on the game was gone. 1 year of progress was all gone. Other than that, the game is pretty fun. Farming, interaction with other players, collecting materials, building houses and etc."
If you want to go very far with this game it gets really expensive. Im at level 47. It takes forever now to get any thing done for example a new type of candy takes 5 hours to make. Expanding into a new area takes 10 hours. Building a new building can take 2 days. Unless of course you want to spend the real dollars to buy play dollars to speed it up. Its not fun anymore like it was at the beginning. Im going to finish up the play dollars I bought and then delete the game.
"I had to change my rating. There have been so many changes made to this game since the second professor's experiments event, and they have sucked the fun right out of a game I used to love. Now I play mainly out of obligation to my co-op. It's turned into a cash grab and they've treated loyal players badly. It mostly boils down to this- they reduced rewards and ramped up difficulty/cost on nearly everything. What a shame."
"I loved this game at first. But now I'm at level 37, each task takes so long to complete, that it just isn't fun any more. Who wants to wait 12 hours for plant to grow, 8 hours for a ship to come back, or 2 days for a building to be done? On top of that, the game is structured to create shortages. The developers want you to spend real money to buy Township cash to speed things up or buy items. And the bonuses you get are pathetically small. It's not playable w/out spending $$$. I'm done."
"LOVE this game! I've been playing this for several months with no issues. But since the last update, it crashes ALL THE TIME without saving all the work I just did. HELP! New update...it works again! Yea! So it's 5 stars from me! Update! I have no clue what's going on with this game.... it will not open anything without crashing! Tired of doing the same thing over and over because it doesn't save! I hope someone is working on it, because I can't find another game that compares!NOW WORKS GREAT!"
"The game used to be great when it was designed for casual play with friends. Now, it's just a mainstream style cash grab with tons of competition that is forced down your throat by way of forced in game pop ups, a newly incorporated ""season pass"" designed only for ""pay to advance"" players, and very little opportunity to just be a casual player and still make advances in the game."
"When I first started playing this game, I had no problems when I would open the plane, or the co-op message board, except sometimes the game would crash when opening the renegade race. But, since updating the game very recently, I cant open the plane, the message board, or sometimes the professor's experiments w/o the game crashing on me, and I am very frustrated about this. I love this game. It is my go-to game, finally found a fun co-op group, but this crashing has to stop, please! PLEASE FIX!"
Very addictive game but very expensive to level up and build your town. Everything is so over priced. Can butmoney to buy things to build buildings or expand your space but yet it's way over priced and to build ur building you need materials that are barely brought on the trains or airplanes so back at buying with ur own money. I'm trying to get away from these type of games where u have to spend so much to build a simple building. The cost doesn't even go down the closer you get to building it.
"Latest update made a great game JUNK. Have been playing for over 6 years on a different tablet. Just started new town a couple of weeks ago. Then was cursed with this update. App doesn""t open, or stay open, progress is lost. Totally frustrating. Updates in the past have occasionally caused issues and you were quick to fix. Please make this a 5 star game again. Two years later, new town has been growing slowly as building has become more difficult. But as of yesterday afternoon app will not open."
"Last year I would have rated a 4 or 5, but this years heavy focus on minigames is disappointing and most of my COOP agrees. The core of the game, building production buildings, growing crops and sending shipments is good. At around level 110 there are no new buildings or new crops. There hasn't been anything new in the core game for a long time."
"What's up with some levels (of the side games, makeup girl, interior makeovers, etc) of these side games? They are stupid and very time consuming. Not everyone have the time and $$ to match all those tiles repeatingly, especially those who are sick or stressed. This is not one of those relaxing games. The main game is okay. It is sort of like an exercise in time management and organization."
"Mini games are sometimes impossible to play. The game closes unexpectedly at some point (always when you reach a particular goal) and when you reopen it again, you lose what you had played: trains sent, daily rewards, etc. Uninstalling and installing the game is not an option to solve the issue (did it several times)."
"This game slowly starts robbing you more and more. They really get you with the barn space. They make it near impossible to have any room in your barn to do anything unless you buy the golden ticket, which costs $5 per month. The golden ticket temporarily increases barn space and once it's over, you lose space and have 100+ items too much in your barn, making it impossible to do anything in the game. It is technically free to play. But to really advance you have to pay. And it adds up quick."
"Doesn't work a lot of the time. Just tried to buy some dollars so that I could get through a super hard level on the in game ""adventure"" (because the level is too hard without any level ups) and it wouldn't let me. Uninstaller right after because I'm tired of waiting for so long to try and get things to work. Looks like it's a known issue."
"This game used to be fun. It lost its way. Now it's trying to be every other money sucking mobile game. It's getting larger in size (Gigabytes). When you can't update it on a device because it's too big, it makes itself obsolete. I still play because I can have fun with some of my family and friends, but that's disappearing. You've lost the simplistic fun, and become too big and clunky. The constant popups telling you to do something is annoying and wasn't in the original design. You were fun..."
"As most games this game, as well, starts out fun & easy in the beginning progressing to a more challenging game, but it becomes so challenging it becomes almost impossible, if not impossible, to pass challenges. Especially in the matching games. When it becomes impossible that's when the Uninstall button comes into play. Challenging can be fun in the gaming world, but impossible is wasting time. And it's the same generated response by the devs feedback answers. Too repetitive! Thanx anyway."
"Too many game crashes when trying to do special events. I did all suggested troubleshoots, in game & email support. Nothing. Other players in Co op group say the same problem. Game itself is fun but if you want to do the extra stuff in Co op be aware it's a shot in the dark if you're going to be one that can access it. I spend alot of money in this game (my choice not a game must) it sucks that I'll most likely just delete it because of this."
"I Used to really enjoy this game, not so much now. I don't like playing many of the mini games. They have integrated them into the Gold Pass and Regatta, making it harder to complete them. I liked the Professor's Experiments better and when the Regatta was separate from everything else. I don't like being forced to play the mini games. I liked it better when I had a choice. It's getting too costly to complete things on there as you pretty much need Township cash to get anywhere in the game."
"I really loved this game, before they changed the contest. Now you have to play the mini games to win. Don't like this new addition to the game. The developers need to change this back to filling orders from all parts of the game. Hope you change this back. ( It is too hard to win the mini games without spending money, the green kind in the game or real money from your pocket) sorry, just not worth it!!!! I just removed a star! again! Support is bad!😭"
"this games works so hard to get you to buy town money with real money, & it still puts ads in it. the game is so slow moving, taking longer to do the same steps when you progress & adding hidden cost once you bought something. but the way the game is structured of having to process goods to make other goods makes it interesting enough to play once a day because of all the wait you have to do if you don't want to spend real money."
Been playing this game 4+ years now. Every winter update is the same. Game crashes when you're collecting regatta rewards force stops. You restart it and it's an endless loop. Last regatta I couldn't even participate. Had to install it on my daughters tablet and that's extremely inconvenient. Trying to play on my phone again after over a week and it's the same issue. Even after numerous uninstalls and reinstalls. I love the game and this is probably my only complaint. Still better than last year
"Used to be pretty good, but they've been stripping out features and games for a while and now it's just a cash grab. They've purged a lot of the variety to the minigames to only rotate in the ones that are the most apt to get cash spend to complete (removing interesting ones that emulate a cooking game, a fruit chop game, a fishing game, and a slingshot game, for example), so now you only see the same few games (a match game that's rigged, a platform drop game, a platform laying game) over and over. They stopped putting effort into seasonal events, instead focusing on re-naming an old ""professors experiments"" event repeatedly to give the illusion of variety. They haven't added new content in forever, once you get to about level 90 or so, you're pretty much out of things to build or expand to. This game feels like it's at the end of its development cycle and now they're just trying to squeeze the last few doucets they can get out of it."
This game used to be fun and would have different mini games to play within the game but now it is the same four boring games on repeat that they advertise as new... the only difference is the things you can win. Honestly it is difficult to win levels without having to purchase boosters. You can open chests for things needed in the game for 3 bucks a pop. It used to be fun but now it is just a money sucking repetitive boring game.
"At first I enjoyed the game. I was looking for a distraction during chemo. I invested about $11 and got to level 23 in five days. Now it's starting to be a lot less fun. Each time you fill a train, the next takes a little longer to return. Day 5 and my trains take 3 hours. Of course, with unlimited cash I could speed them up. And the new mini game has no learning / practice mode and I find it impossible. In the end, I will choose to delete because it's designed to become less fun over time."
I've been playing Township over 5 years and it's changed a lot. Now there are back to back events and always the same thing. I used to like the challenges it had before like harvesting and feeding animals. I don't use boosters anymore because there's nothing to boost with the same tasks over and over again. As soon as I find a better game I will go there instead. Thank you.
Forces you to play match 3 games to progress in the farming/town portion of the game. The match 3 hard levels are so difficult you can't beat them without using powerups which you get very few of. Purposefully makes the barn too small. Makes it difficult to get materials to build community buildings. Don't waste your time with this game. They're just fishing for in-app purchases.
"Love the game but when I lost all my ""Township"" progress during a transfer. It was like phone tag (But through email) with support. Then I got an email saying the issue was closed. Stating I didn't answer by their deadline. I don't check my email on a daily basis or not every notification shows. Having to lose all those levels, money used for the ticket and other purchases in the Township. On the account I lost and now starting over is pretty upsetting."
The game is but I purchased thr golden ticket when I first started playing. I enjoyed it fully. Thought it was wonderful to not have any restrictions. Never ran out of barn room. Now the new season started and its not fully playable anymore. I would need to purchase the ticket again. It's not worth $5 every few weeks. Uninstalling
"This app has a lot of issues. I went to bed with over 87000 coins and woke up with 27000 coins. Can u help? Stleast fix. Also, when playing the colored squares game it didn't up my points, many times, after a game was done. For example example I had 187 points then won with 64 points and nothing was added. I've spent money on this game so I think I'm about done. Keldpat at Homeland Happiness"
"This game takes planning, but has problems. The side adventure that you solve puzzles does not close when you fail to complete the puzzle and has impossible puzzles that cannot be finished. I am upwards of 40 attempts and have given up on it. Buildings require certain items that can take a week or more to get, which holds you back in growth. This game is not worth playing if you don't want to pay cash as you need the dollars to get the items you need to complete tasks."
"I love the game itself... However the mini games is what takes this score down so low.. the mini game changes ever so often. And sometimes you have to earn tickets by playing a ""candy crush"" type of game to complete things. Whenever we get that kind of minigame, it must be rigged because it's IMPOSSIBLE. I will spend 2 days straight on the same level then it never fails by the 3rd day all of a sudden it's super easy to beat. It's like they want you to spend cash and when you don't, then it works"
Absolutley every mini game sucks. Especially the matching one. It's impossible to complete any level without spending money. Other than that the game is OK at best. Tired of pay to win games. I miss the days where you could download any game for free or 99 cents and progress steadily without spending extra money. Rip.
I loved this game until it started crashing and stopped syncing my progress between devices. I lost hours of progress. The support system is an endless round and round with an automated bot asking the same thing over and over. Don't fall into the mistake of actually putting money into this app. You stand to lose it all.
"While the play is fine, it never seems to save my progress before I leave the game. Every time I go back into the game, several of the things I've done before leaving previously (planting stuff, feeding animals, packing trains, etc) gets reset when I go back in. It's such a waste of my time and then makes it harder to finish the quests in the allotted amount of time. This has happened way too many times and I've only been playing for a few weeks."
"The more I play this game the less I like it. I start to realize it was designed not with maximum fun in mind, but rather maximum greed. For example, back end contruction costs. Pay up front for your building, and once it's finished building you have to come up with more resources to complete it. Acquiring land is like pulling teeth and only gets harder as you advance, making it difficult to design a fun town. It has its charm but the greed factor drags it down the further into the game you get."
"Have been playing this game for over 5 yrs, guess I like it. Getting close to 6 yrs. Factories and zoo buildings are getting very expensive to build. Disappointed in that. Well, with new download, can't get on to play at all. Started 2 weeks ago and was having problems but now new Events Calendar started today and CAN NOT get on at all. Very disappointed."
"It's super fun but takes wayyyy too long to gain supplies and tools to upgrade your barn, finish construction, etc. After playing for a day now I just check in every couple hours and can only play for a couple minutes and then there's nothing left to do because I can't expand, craft anything, feed the animals, harvest crops etc. because I simply ""my barn is full."" Also, the train rarely brings what I need and you will never earn enough money to buy the supplies."
"I've had just about enough. Firstly, the ad that moved me to download this game was a COMPLETE misrepresentation of gameplay. Secondly, some of the events seem rigged in that they appear to have elements and ""glitches"" that make it nearly impossible to complete the rounds without paying. Thirdly, everything takes an eternity to load or progress. But, the last straw was when I couldn't enter the app due to an update (in the middle of an event AND a regatta mind you) that will not download!!"
"Playing since 2019. Each time I buy a package, the game gets harder to beat, losing coins I just bought. Not right. And ,I'm really getting irritated about every time there's an update; the game gets more and more stingy with the rewards. The latest one u guys took out the dynamite after digging up the treasure using most of my energy. Rewards with free lives are useless. We used to get coins or some other reward. I think it's almost time to quit playing. It's not much fun anymore"
I've been playing for years. I've just uninstalled it. The prizes used to be much better. It's impossible to get a winning streak going because they threw in these ridiculous super hard levels. It's just a scheme to take your boosters. The final straw for me are the levels where you need to eliminate puzzle pieces that come out of the little chute. How can you eliminate them if the game won't make them actually appear. Used to be fun. Not anymore
"Honestly, I've only been playing for a little while and it's very clear after the first bit of playing that the levels become almost impossible to be without a large number of boosters, so you will end up playing the same level 20 times if you aren't willing to spend money. It's also a game that rewards absence giving you free play time if you've been gone for a while. Not terrible but a subtle cashgrab for sure like most match 3 games. Bummer."
Second Chance No Better. Downloaded for a second time because of an ad in another game. I don't pay to play. Looked like they have changed the format based on the ad. They didn't. Stuck on the same level for over a week. Maybe more. It's one of their Hard Levels. Typically they do take longer but don't see a way to win without paying!
"You shouldn't limit how many moves some has especially on the special levels(like hard, super hard). The other thing, give us a little more life on the special games. Like right now trying to find Rachel. Why do I have to spend life energy or whatever that is, to collect items. Don't see that in other games."
"I had this game a few years ago and it was amazing. I never like matching games but it was great and I liked making the garden. I changed to an Android and had to start over sadly, but it was more disappointing to want to play the game and you can't. The mini games are a cool idea, but I'd rather them be an option and not have to click yes or no every time I try to play the matching game. I need patience for the pop-ups related to the game and ads, I just got more annoyed playing than before."
"Becomes almost unplayable when you get to higher levels. They are hoping that you will spend money for some of the ""helpful"" tools. Most of the ones you select before the levels will actually hurt your chances. The ones during the level just aren't worth it unless you're a move away from winning. The levels aren't really puzzles they are heavily luck based and the pieces are randomized. They are just hoping to catch the people who spend money without thinking through the lack of benefit from it."
"Playing since 2019. Really gone downhill. Story and mini games are still cool, but many levels, especially later ones are mathematically impossible without paying through nose. Examples include levels where you need to have a piece of a specific color to win, then 3 or 4 moves without piece appearing. Or you start in small box and unless everything combines into a perfect boost. Challenge is cool. Mercy of random number gen is garbage."
"Been playing this game a long time and it used to be really fun and relaxing. Now it crashes every two minutes, glitches with text and side quests, and cannot even stay loaded for very long. Sounds like it could be the new updates or lack there of, but overall it is extremely disappointing and annoying. Will probably stop playing altogether if it is never resolved."
"Be aware that the farther you go in the levels, the fewer moves you'll get. And game makers have changed moves provided in the last several years. One level that had 25 moves in 2019 had 17 moves by 2020 and now has 13 moves in 2023. It's a push toward more in-app purchases, but it's only convinced me to delete the game. There's no point in playing if I can't pass a regular level for several days - and the next level is a Challenge mode level that destroys any gained boosters. Not my idea of fun"
"I actually really love this game. Been playing for a couple years. However, the last 2 updates have made the game freeze constantly. As soon as I start up the game, within seconds it freezes. I tried to play in the Fall and gave up and waited for the update because I couldn't log on at all. The new update freezes as soon as I log on. I was able to play when I first updated and spent money that I lost becasue I wasn't able to play due to freezing. Im sorely disappointed-I just want to play :(("
"A wonderful game, until the higher levels. There is no way past unless a player pays for the extra lives and buys, with real money I might add, the extra tools. I would not mind if this were an one time thing, yet every few levels is too much. Thus the reason I have lowered from 5 stars to 2 stars and uninstalled."
Tricks u to spend money! I've read many other reviews and they all say the same thing! It's fun to play and decorate the yards but to advance in each project u have to beat a game... I spent $20 in less than 5 minutes because I was desperately trying to beat one level I was stuck on!!! Just to advance and run into the same problem. They give u clues but when u use them it just makes u run out of points and u end up either stuck and buying more or using all your lives to play it over and over!
"I've seen a lot, and I do mean a lot of reviews about how extremely difficult it is to play this game, especially the super hard levels. Like, level 94, how can anyone who's exhausted all their boosters and doesn't have enough in game cash to continue once the remaining moves are gone expected to pass it? Like seriously, 11 moves to get 40 highly baracaded acorns? Maybe on level 194 but not on level 94! And we shouldn't have to click on a link in order to get tips to pass certain levels!"
"I am on level 10000. The game recently is making it more difficult to even beat a regular level almost as much a hard or super hard level. Also, magic hats doesn't really help it forces you to once again spend money. I have spent too much money trying to pass easy levels. Also the ""challenge"" level makes you lose all your power ups unless you use your own power ups and then immediately to a hard level on the next one."
"I used to and at times still love this game! However, the further you get the more impossible it gets to beat levels. I've watched the game cheat me out of moves, and don't EVER pay for season bonuses --it seems as tho the closer you get to FINALLY completing one, you get stuck on levels so that you never finish unless you pay more. And if you do beat it, surprise, super hard level next with no bonuses. Not to mention the ""cost"" of renovation events are kind of a joke."
"I really used to enjoy playing this game, however, it seems every third round is a ""hard"" round that takes days, sometimes over a week to conquer. Very seriously considering uninstalling and spending more time playing similar games online. Fun game. Just wish there was a back button for a move that is a mistake. Also when there is free play, would be nice to resume if you have to stop. Not everyone has three hours to play continuously."
"I was really enjoying this game until I encountered an issue where an add kept returning during the matching game with no way to move past it without forfeiting the game and losing a point. As long as there are unexploded items a matching game is still playable, but it wouldn't let me continue. Selecting continue game got you the add screen and if I tried to close the add I went back to the continue game screen."
"I have been playing this game for years and am well into the 6000 level range. The last several updates have really been an issue, mainly the side quest games are becoming very glitchy, and game stops and crashes quite a bit. As this is the only game it seems to be happening with, I can only assume the problems lie with the game. I hope there will be some improvements in the next update. :("
"Despite being a fun storyline there are several issues. 1) When you get to the higher levels you don't get a sufficient amount of moves to beat the levels. 2) When you buy more moves you only get 5 extra with each package, it doesn't vary so you may end up spending quite a bit to try and ""win"" the first time. 3) No choice in completing tasks. I don't like birds and didn't want birds in my garden, but it forces you to get them. Overall, this game and in-app purchases should be restructured."
"Not surprised this is a top grossing game, but for all the wrong reasons. High pressure to buy things. Game quickly gets stupid frustrating. You have to win rounds to build your garden, but you have to do all the chores listed, including things like cracking the code on a useless old suitcase and washing the butler's fine wear. As the game progresses, you get a point where it's almost impossible to win a round without boosters, and difficult to win even with boosters, since the puzzles start out with so few available moves, that you're forced to use your boosters at the start when they can't do much good. So you blow through them quickly. Some game play gives you an automatic booster for ther next round, with no option to save for later. And I swear it has bugs it the play. I've done moves that should have freed up pieces, but didn't. Annoying game."
"I have played home scapes and garden scapes. The games are fun and entertaining. I enjoy the choices to upgrade and complete the house and garden. I do not agree with the fact that it takes 2 or 3 days ( sometimes longer ) to complete some levels for 1 star, just to have the creators to increase the amount of stars to continue on to the next objective. That is a ploy for players who get frustrated to pay for cheat help! With the amount of players and ratings, that should not be an issue!!"
"Started out fun , not enjoying the game anymore. Level 37 seems to be impossible to beat. To frustrating just to get coins , etc to fix up the garden . I will be deleting this game . The complicated levels take all the fun out of the game. I know they should be challenging , but not so unreasonably difficult. I'm really good at these games , never had to buy moves and wont start. It appears the setup is designed to make you buy packages or you cant win levels ."
"I downloaded this because of an in-app ad. I'm in the 100s and it is nothing like what was previewed. It was supposed to problem solving with different tools. I dont mind the matching stuff too, but you should have what was advertised included. It is incredibly difficult. I like a challenge but to be stuck on a level for DAYS is frustrating. EDIT 4/9: Thank you for the tips help line but you did not address the fact that in app advertising is misleading. What are you doing about it?"
It is a fun game but very quickly becomes very difficult. I'm at level 345 or so and the levels are nearly unattainable without significant power ups. At times it seems that the game is either glitchy or rigged because pieces will fall off an obstacle differently depending upon how well you are doing on that level. I'm not happy over all. but it is fun for a short time. don't download. It is a waste of time and they have it set to get too much of your money.
"The plot of this storyline could use some freshness. But the design is cute and friendly. We should have the option to ""be"" the caretaker of the property rather than have us removed from the action as the owner. The ads are misleading because 90% of this game is a ""bejeweled/connect 4"" type puzzle with the ""help me out"" challenges being too few & far between"
"I, like many others, downloaded this game with the expectations that I would be choosing between items that would best support the character to help get him out of certain situations. I have yet to encounter ANY of those types of situations. So far its a candy crush game to earn stars to fix up a garden. I have made it to level 45, I am stuck and have yet to see anything like the advertisement. I refuse to buy coins or items just to beat a level in a game that is nothing like I expected."
"Very fun game, however extremely hard to get past levels without spending money. I think levels should gradually get harder, however, levels are named ""Hard"" and ""Extremely Hard"" almost from the very beginning. You have to complete levels of gardens to get power ups which take forever to achieve. Love the concept but I'm uninstalling due to the amount of money needed to play the game!"
"I installed it because it was an ad for another game. The ad is nothing like the actual game which is a shame. In any case, the game is fun but like others mention, very frustrating. Not enough turns are given to even remotely come close to beating certain levels. As mentioned, spending money is required to advance further without ""chancing"" a win at most levels. I uninstalled it because I won't spend that kind of money and when you can't beat a level after trying 50+ times, it's not worth it."
"I liked this game at first. I enjoyed the concept of completing match-3 levels to help restore your garden and by proxy further the story. And that was fun. And I even enjoyed some of the more challenging levels. But it got to the point where the levels became TOO challenging to the point where levels were no longer a test of my puzzle solving skills, but whether I had the right buffs and items (and gold) to pass. Around the time the lily pads were added is where the game stopped being fun."
There game is not like advertised... I'm at level 42 and haven't been given the option for the life challenges or what if scenarios as advertised. It's more like sims meets candy crush. It's not bad but I can see it getting boring quick. Good thing... it's fairly easy to get lives and you can play for quite some time if you can complete the levels
"Starts off fun, but once you reach higher levels not only does the difficulty increase, but the number of stars needed to do anything increases, and later areas start sharply reducing the number of things you can actually choose the design of. Eventually it just becomes a slog, where even when you are able to do something, it more than likely simply puts an unchangeable item in the garden that gives you none of the creative control that was what made the game fun to begin with."
"This could be an enjoyable game, but as it is it's just another ""pay to play"" aggravation. While I don't mind supporting developers, I DO mind when the PTW element is over the top, and this one most certainly is. 900 coins for 5 extra moves (and you'll need them for a good many levels) is ridiculous when the reward for completing the level is about 60 to 70 coins. I'm deleting this one without hesitation."
"I spend way too much time on hard and super hard levels trying to earn stars, and not enough time building a beautiful garden. Ready to uninstall this game. I didn't say the levels aren't beatable. Just time consuming. Frustrating. If you have to spend even more time researching tips and help to get through them, they are too difficult, in my opinion. As you level up, you quit earning 2 stars on super hard levels!"
"I decided to try this based on an ad in another game, but the ad was completely misleading. It showed the garden in disarray, and you would choose from a set of tools to repair (or fail to) broken parts. The real game involves being assigned random things to fix by your butler (why is my butler telling me what to do??), and you have to play a match-3-tiles game to earn stars to complete tasks. It's boring. You can't skip tasks and the puzzle aspect had nothing to do with repairing the garden."
The game seems to cheat you as you move to higher levels. The game requires spending a lot of money just to move to another level. Then you lose interest. Do nit like decisions made for me to select an item or move to another section if garden or switch to an entirely new garden away from estate. Do not like some of the selections for garden. You have to use vendor's selection to customize garden. Many are poor selection.
"fun game but just like the rest of them, once you get up a few levels and think you are doing good the levels become impossible unless you spend money to get advantages. i refuse to spend money to win a game. i have been on a specific level for a few days now, if i don't get the colors to drop i need to beat the level, it will go like the rest and be deleted."
"I've been bombarded with ads for this game for ages and decided to give it a try. It is not the game the ads make it out to be. It's a puzzle matching game instead of the choice-driven game advertised. The game looks nice and has basic puzzle matching mechanics, but is obviously designed to encourage you to spend real money (as most games are now). Despite the misleading ads I gave it try for a few days. Pretty boring, very disappointing. Will be uninstalling it."
Has the potential to be a fun game. You get way to little for the minigames and they get to the point where it feels you are required to pay to progress. DEFINITELY NOT AS ADVERTISED. Also being required to play a minigame to do anything feels very excessive. Graphics are nice and story seems interesting. It wants too much of both my wallet and time to be fun though. Dont know if the games change as you get higher in levels as I only progressed so far.
"I have been playing this game for a long time and refuse to pay for boosters or lives. Therefore it sometimes takes me days to beat a level. The most frustrating thing is to need something that isn't showing on the board or to be only one square away from winning and run out of plays. I have almost quit several times. Update Dec 20: after 2000+ levels, the game has frozen. It won't load at all . It starts to loadand then stops so I can't play. Damn."
"The main reason why only have this two stars is due to the false advertising. The engaging ""choice"" games in the advertising are nowhere to be found in the game. It's a puzzle game similar to candy crush. That's misleading and should be illegal. In addition, the game is very monotonous and repetitive. You beat levels to gain coins and then use those coins to upgrade your garden. It's just a never ending game of clicking and waiting as different parts of the garden are being upgraded."
"I love the game! I do NOT like the ""in app purchases""!!! So far, it is possible to win levels without buying power ups etc. However it takes a lot of trys! I also do not like how expensive the purchases are! Other than that, LOVE the game! Well, it was fun and I liked the game, right up to level 137! That level has been impossible to win without buying ""in app purchases""! I've got better things to spend my VERY HARD EARNED money on! Uninstalling the game today!"
"The ads presented this as a choice-based adventure game. No, it's just a match game. If one wants to play a long time, many fo the prizes are for infinite lives for amfixed amount of t I'm me. I would typically have a couple hours banked up, but I don't want to play that long. More variety beyond a simple match game would make the game more appealing."
"I have NEVER spent this much money on a game! And I have spent DAYS on some levels. I have read some comments and they are spot on. One star per EVERY level is not ok. The ""super hard"" levels should pay off. It IS upsetting to do all that work to buy a phone call or pruning shears and not make any renovations. And the ads are very misleading. That game is a couple minutes in days of play."
"The game is ok. Some levels are very hard and 900 coins is not worth it to keep playing for only 5 more moves. edit: once you get to the higher up levels things cost 3 stars, and sometimes even more as you have to complete something in steps. if you have tons of power ups you can use them to beat hard levels but if you dont then you just spend forever on 1 level trying to get 3 stars to do something only for the next part to be another 3 stars. I'm almost to the point where I'm about to delete!"
"False advertising. If you were brought here by the obstacle course ads, THERE ARE NO OBSTACLE COURSES. It is all matching sliding pieces to bring down or collect pieces, to earn points to then restore and decorate sub-gardens, or points to use to apply their solutions to occasional problems. But I will still give it two stars, because other than not being at all the game that was advertised, it's quite engrossing."
"Okay, at first. The ad was extremely misleading. This is not a decision making game of consequence. I was disappointed but okay for a while. And as you progress to the harder levels it is nearly impossible to pass some without purchasing little boosters to assist you. I quit at level 97. A game should never be so difficult that you can't pass it without having to buy something."
"While it's true the game is entertaining, it's also very greedy, needy, and misleading! You must check in daily for bonuses, but this game basically requires you to play non-stop in order to get rewards and move up the leaderboard and get to the next league. Otherwise, you are demoted. Also, every single action in the game requires stars to execute, and you only get one star per level passed! They also rig levels so you have to use boosts to pass! And where's the story mode? I think I'll delete!"
"I really enjoyed this game over the years. I've spent alot of money and had several accounts on different phones. However, I just deleted it, because I was level 2000 and something and I'm getting slammed with back to back almost purple, red, and pink levels. Being stuck on the same level for over a week and losing all power ups isn't fun. Though I loved decorating the garden it's just not worth it anymore."
"I downloaded the game because the puzzles looked fun in the ads. Instead it's just a bunch of match three puzzles with some extra steps. It's cute overall, but since it was advertised as one thing and is another altogether, it has that going against it, for me. The way the puzzles are structured with limited turns, it really is more about luck than skill or strategy, which is really annoying. This is especially apparent when they want you to pay for extra lives."
"I was enjoying the game I've reach level 867 but now it has just stopped. I've restarted my phone, checked the app itself, powered off my phone and it still won't open. If I have to reinstall it and start all over I won't be playing anymore. Also, I agree with the cost of the power ups being insanely expensive. 1900 coins just for 3 rainbow spinners?! REALLY!"
"I enjoyed your game until I got to level 94. I've tried it with multiple power-ups and probably around 50 times. I am great with a game being challenging, but there is a difference between challenging and hoping you get lucky. Every game should be winnable if played right, but at this point I'm certain that your interest is in me buying something which isn't going to happen. Also, this game was advertised as a pull the pin game, but is nothing more than another glorified candy crush. Uninstall."
"There are many many times where I had gotten stuck on a level for WEEKS because I wouldn't or couldn't spend coins on extra moves. Which is a shame because it can actually be a really fun game.. The biggest problem I have, though, are the ads! They don't show how the game is at all which is very obnoxious and the photos on those page are no better."
"It takes to many lives to reach each level, that needs to be improved I have had to try at least 40 times to reach several levels i dont buy anything i play for fun, the graphics are great, but you need to let us reach levels quicker. im about to uninstall this game because of how many lives it takes to get to each level other than that i would like it much better and willing to keep it installed right now i am not sure if i will keep it installed? its very frustrating :("
Concept is good but honestly some of the levels are almost impossible to play without spending money or spend days on one level. Almost impossible to earn enough coins for power ups unless you buy it and can't get far on some levels without power ups. This game frustrated me to no end and I usually do well on puzzle games. It would have been more fun if there were more ways to earn coins to buy power ups without spending real cash. Buy to win type of game.
"If someone is looking for a match-3 game with other activities along the way, then fine. But that's not what the previews for this game show. It shows puzzles where you need to make decisions to solve a problem or get someone/something somewhere. Those puzzles looked kind of fun, but after a few hours of doing match-3 levels to get credits so I can put decorations in the garden, I had still not seen anything like the previews. If this is going to be primarily match-3, then they should market it as such. Or if they are going to market it as problem-solving puzzles, then they should give the user that kind of puzzles without having to wade through the match-3 levels, which I can find in dozens (or hundreds) of other games. Match-3 is not why I loaded this app (but it is why I uninstalled it)."
It's enjoyable when the levels are challenging. But it's really no fun when the levels are impossible to complete. For many of the levels the only way to successfully complete them is by making in app purchases. I guess because there are no in app ads they rely on purchases to make their money. As I said earlier in the higher levels the only way to successfully complete the challenge is to purchase extra lives. There are plenty of other puzzle games available that are much more enjoyable to play
"Looks great, and starts strong... But then quickly devolves into a pay to play model that doesn't really allow progress unless you shell out a continual stream of cash. You know it's bad when there's an option to pay $100 for some items and coins. No thank you. I'd much rather spend that kind of money on two or three really good Switch games."
"This is an addicting game but it's not like it is advertised at all. I originally downloaded it because the games showed on the ads looked fun but I realized right away that it was another matching game. I still play because it's still fun and I play it on my down time. It is however very much 'pay to play' if you want to earn enough tickets to renovate a room or advance from a hard level or something. Otherwise, you'd be stuck on a difficult level for days."
"It's ok. Nothing special. More of a time killer. Something to do while your waiting to accrue free play time on other more interesting games. It's a shame really. With just a bit more effort, they could've actually made it fun, challenging, interesting to play. Instead, they settled for, in my opinion, making the game equivalent of a ""Gilligan's Island"" rerun. It's an ""Oh well, guess it's better than nothing"" type option. They add external enhancements often but never improve the game itself."
"Originally 5, now 2. Are they under new management? The ads for the game are completely wrong. You have to match rows of at least three (think Candy Crush) to complete different puzzles. The game itself is fun! But the levels are now nearly impossible unless you use a powerup. They are provided via challenges (and forced tornaments) weekly, but are purposefully placed in the most inconvenient spot so you lose then pay money to continue on. Went from recommending the game to calling it trash."
Game is fun and addictive but it has many glitches that just aren't right like if you need to pause and get back to life for a moment and you are on a level with all of your progressive boosters when you come back you automatically lose that level and all of your boosters that you have worked hard for to progress through the game. I've reached out to technical support about this numerous times. They did not care really. Time to let this game go for me.
"Knocking it down two stars because the advertising is misleading about what the game actually does. I downloaded the game because it advertised me saving characters through decision making in difficult situations and I am on level 1317 and the game is still just matching fruit and decorating a garden! Pretty irritating. I have even spent money to see if I got to certain level, then it would be part of the game. Nope. If you enjoy match games it is cool. Same issue with Homescapes."
"Enjoyed it at first but the hard levels are ridiculous. It would be easy to spend $5 on just one level to get through it. I thought the points I earned could be used on upgrades but most now are for calling a plumber, carpenter etc. instead of actually improving the property. Too bad, I actually enjoyed the interactions with the butler. Instead I am deleting the game off my phone. All these calling for help is boring."
"I download the game due to false advertising. I don't mind decorating the land. I get really aggravated with all the unnecessary things you have to do for example feed the dog, call someone, change the tire. I just want to make the property look nice without the stupid stuff. I also feel like $900 is to much for 3 extra moves when you only earn $70 when you win a level. I actually go a long time without playing because some of the levels are very hard."
"Some levels are ridiculously so difficult, that yes, I'm sure you could beat without spending actual $, but it would take days to get through. I'm not looking for a super easy game to play, but I'm also not looking to waste that much time on one very difficult level every 5 levels or so. You can spot their pattern pretty easily after awhile, and it has become more annoying than fun now. I have switched over to playing Lily's Garden, which is much more realistically playable."
"Be prepared to become very frustrated with this game. ""Easy"" level? ""Super Hard"" level? Lots of power ups? None of it matters. Chances of beating a level is all tied to the game's algorithm of what shape gets dropped when you make a match. It's amazing how many times you're literally one move away from beating a level and you run out of moves. Unless, of course, you want to spend real $ to keep going. Are you trying to move a piece to the left to make a match? Nope. It's going to the right."
"This game was fun for a while, but like others said, once you get to the higher levels, they are so hard that it's not even fun any more. After 30 or 40 tries on the same level, it is just frustrating and not motivating to continue to play. Especially when I already bought extra power ups and coins, used them all on one level (that's not even listed as a hard level) and still can't get past it. I guess the developers don't want to program more garden areas so it costs players to just keep losing"
"Fun, but completely different then ANY of the advertising. I got an ad for it where you had to choose something to save two people. That is NOTHING like what the game is. I have gotten another ad that made it look like you have to choose the right thing to fix the garden. Again NOTHING like this game. Since everybody is making ads like this, somebody should just make a game out of it! Like I said the game was fun, but all of the advertising was completely different than what the game really was."
"This game has many levels, but you have to make in app purchases to get enough lives, coins, and aides to pass the levels. Progression is very slow as levels are almost impossible to pass. I cannot recommend this game. Do not purchase especially if you like playing solo. It also is not challenges like advertising shows. You are matching fruits to uncover hidden objects. Tedious and frustrating."
"Really enjoyed playing the game, challenging and interesting and worth purchasing resources to level up. Unfortunately I've lost interest after trying to solve a super hard level for a week, I was on my last move to finish game, it froze and the game restarted. Happened before but the last 2 were on super hard levels that took a lot of attempts to solve, both froze on the last move to finish. So demoting to 2 stars from 5."
"Worked great until the update. I have the latest updated version, but level 84 refuses to do anything. As soon as it's opened, it freezes except for the portal light animation. I've contacted support, but I'm stuck in an infinite automation loop. (see also, their reply to this review) Also an issue: the advertisements that become more and more false as the years go on. The game doesn't work the way the advertisements show."
"A fairly good game if you have patience. Can't get through levels very quickly without buying power-ups. The worst part is that the game sometimes bugs out and doesn't destroy certain tiles. This can be really irritating when it costs you the level. Other than the major issues stated, it has pretty good art and has about the level of story telling you'd expect from this kind of game. one thing that really bugs me is the false advertising of the game. I had the game before so its not as annoying."
"Number of moves have gone down, so it's almost impossible to beat the levels without boosters, or spending days on them. No longer have choices to make in area redesigns - there's only one or two things where you actually get to make a choice. The bonus redos are pretty much impossible to complete unless you spend hours on the game (and I really don't like the makeover one)."
"I've been playing this game on and off since it's original release in 2009, now on level 9642. It's sad to see how they've turned this from a fun but challenging game into a frustrating one that can't be beat without purchases. There used to be difficult levels, but with a few lives and a power up or two, they could be beat. Now the ""easy"" levels are almost impossible to win without paying for extras. I know everyone loves money, but this is ridiculous guys. You've ruined the game."
"The game is impossible to beat without spending money. I uninstalled for almost a year and only beat the level when I reinstalled because of in-game welcome back powerups. It would be great to be asked to participate in the races instead of automatically being entered. Let us keep our power ups if we fail the challenge levels, we're already losing significant prizes if we don't beat the level. I've been playing this for years but am getting fed up. I do love that there are no ads."
"App worked great until I installed a new update on 3/4. Has been VERY glitchy since :-(. It suddenly closes at very inopportune times. I always lose lives, coins, etc when it does that. VERY annoying! 1/21 I'M DONE!!! After update 12/20, I've had nothing but problems. I spend more time loading the app than playing because it keeps shutting down. Never got to play the mini games that are in all the ads. Only the match 3 games. Deleting app. Finding something more reliable. Austin is creepy to me!"
"WHAT'S WITH THE FALSE ADVERTISING?! Anyways,it's a great game at 1st, then it gets progressively harder, which is to be expected. However, like with most other games of this genre, the ""rewards"" u get compared to the amount u have to use to get boosters or power ups is ridiculous. Basically ensuring u have to spend money to keep playing past a certain point or end up frustrated and stuck. Really greedy on the developers' part. U gotta make money but this is overboard! Like all the others."
"The story is kinda fun, building the garden is over the top but not in a horrible way - the actual matching games are just annoying. Using any boosters, because they are randomly assigned spaces by the game, usually makes the game LESS winnable. Of course the further you go, the more you need to purchase just to get through a round. The higher levels are like scratching lottey tics - no skill, just luck. Gardenscapes starts as a decent time killer, but just becomes a time and money pit."
"I've been playing this game for a long time and used to find it fun and relaxing. The levels have become increasingly difficult to beat unless you're willing to spend $$ on power boosts, etc. You'll get a couple of easier levels and then back-to-back hard levels followed by super hard levels. This has led to me to play less ans less and to lose interest. I no longer find it relaxing and enjoyable. It's becoming more and more frustrating. Ready to uninstall and go back to Lily's Garden."
"The game is fun but the ads are misleading. You only do the problem solving things maybe like 3 times before they just give up on it, which is frustrating because I really enjoyed it. Also when you get rooms to renovate, you don't even get to keep the room if you don't complete EVERY ITEM which is does not happen once the levels get really hard. It starts to become next to impossible to do almost anything after a while. You're set up to fail, and spending any money on it is pointless."
"Played since 2013 and I echo the other reviews. Levels are nearly impossible now, even with power ups. I figure the programmers are tired of keeping up the game and are passively encouraging long time players to retire out. The super challenge levels have the purpose of stopping your winning streak and power ups and nothing more. Plus, there used to be fun features. For last few years it's the same game themes and layouts just less turns. They lost me and my money sadly."
"Fun but cheap instances keep happening. Paid a lot of money for this and that. The last 3 times I have just minimized the window/app (to answer a call or something), it takes away the powerups I chose to use from my bank (like normal) but when I go back into the game it's on the garden where I select to play, fulfill a task, etc. It doesn't start off where I left off in the middle of the game. Just takes my items and makes me start over. It's bogus!"
"I recently returned to this game again because I missed it and it's fun. I'm dismayed to see that now there are challenge rounds which you have 1 chance to defeat. They are almost impossible, and I lose all the special skills I had up to that point. I bought the season ticket but am stuck on a hard level with no power ups left so my money has been wasted because I would have to spend more to buy tokens or special skills to progress in time. It's gotten too hard and I am going to uninstall."
"I don't usually leave reviews, but I was so disappointed. Firstly, it's NOTHING like the game that was advertised. I wanted to be able to figure out how to ""fix"" plumbing, electrical, etc. What I got instead was another version of candy crush but with a storyline. It's not a bad game, it's just nothing what I expected when advertised while playing my other games. And not to mention level 8 is impossible to beat."
"Gameplay is good, and being able to see different parts of the garden rebuilt is satisfying. However, as the levels get more difficult, you are forced to spend money to get boosters to clear the level. I did spend some money here and there, yet I cannot justify spending more money when the payoff is so low. I understand the need to be profitable, but this game borders on being straight greedy."
"I totally disliked that you call this ""GARDEN"" scapes, but you force us to use our hard earned points on things like a pet. You also force us to change our gardens without giving the player a choice. Show us what designs we can change it to then let us decide if or when we want to change it! It's not easy earning points and there are plenty of places in the garden to fix without adding all the other stuff. I uninstalled the game because I was told what to do, instead of being given a choice."
"Not what I thought it was. It's a matching puzzle game, not what they advertise with solving puzzles with the man character which they call solving dreams. You only get 4 such puzzles. Matching the peices is difficult, and requires making purchases to get through some of the levels. Sometimes, the game is unfair. I am about to delete this game because of the difficulty of getting through the levels and I'm not wasting my money like that on a game that is based primarily on luck."
It's not the game that was advertised. It's a three matching game. Super fun for the first day you play and then the levels get incredibly difficult that you have to spend money on to even get a chance of winning. I've been on this level for like 2 days and it's extremely frustrating. Very little reward. Many other similar games that are better in my opinion.
Its good but I downloaded it thinking it was something else. All the ads I have seen for this advertise a pull the pin type game or a game where you can just design your own garden. Same with homescapes. Its a candy crush type game and you don't advertise it at all in the ads and in the pictures when you download you have to scroll pretty far back. I would rate it higher but it is not good for how it is advertised.
"Have enjoyed to over level 2000 but since you took away the weekly training it's almost impossible to win levels without purchasing coins, lives, or boosters. I'm not impressed enough to purchase, & since your algorithm makes sure you can't win without purchase, I'm uninstalling. If you want to keep people playing, they have to be able to beat levels at least occasionally. Definitely not purchasing something when it's obvious you'll fall into a black hole doing so."
when the levels are to hard to pass it's not fun. and it takes to make stars to keep playing a level and you only get 5 more moves. plus they put earned stars in a safe that you have to buy ugh. And it's to frustrating to keep playing the same level over and over again. I'm not say every level needs to be easy but most people play games just to have fun and this game is supposed to have you do things to fix the house but you can't do that until you pass the levels so what's the point.
"I *like* this game, but the levels are unnecessarily hard. I have uninstalled it before, but it's been a while, so I forgot why. But just a few levels in I find it all coming back. You get to a point that it is nearly impossible to beat the level unless you buy boosts. I wanted to relax and bust some jewels, not spend 30 minutes trying the same level over and over. Unfortunately, it's uninstall time again."
"The art and storyline are great, but like Homescapes, the levels are incredibly hard, taking very little skill to solve, but depend mostly on the lucky combinations of random pieces. I get a headache from mindless swiping through a series of useless moves, since there are few good possibilities. Very clear game designers don't know what they're doing."
"Power ups should help not hinder. it's obvious on some of the harder levels we win when you decide we do. Having plenty of turns left and waiting for certain things to drop or become visible. eg. rockets,. you need 10 but there are only 5 or 6. The boosters always land in a bad spot. i thought they were supposed to help."
"I really like the game, especially at first. But loading the game takes forever now, several minutes, in which time I get impatient and just close it out opting for a different game instead. Also, the in-game animating menus and leader boards from side games i don't care about pop up too often keeping me from just playing. I don't play as much any more, considering just uninstalling"
Dropped from 5 to 2 stars for the same reasons a bunch of other people have stated. The games is more set up to get you to spend more and more money to complete levels. The challenge levels are terrible because you only have one shot so they become streak killers. I've played and enjoyed this game for years but now it has become just a cash grab. I'm done spending money for nothing. Until this is fixed I will continue to play but I will spend no more money. Thanks
"Used to be entertaining. Now you can't finish anything without paying. Even if you ignore all the events, the levels are set up to require boosters or time, so progress is extremely slow. And when you get a bonus, like free lives for finishing a day, the level becomes so hard you can't clear it without extra boosters. Not fun anymore."
"I liked this game, yet I get frustrated to the point of not wanting to play it and even contemplate of deleting it from my phone. the game, like most users have expressed can be challenging (not in a good way), as well not fun. for the most part I keep on here for my down time or bored, which is very little. It puts me in a moody mode and can unfulfilling give the player(s) in a funk in which it could get better ratings, but yet it shows no improvements; and just for playing and failing ONE level"
"The adverts make you think this is something other than a match 3 game. It's fine in that regard, but the custonization options for the garden are lacking. Not a big fan of how it looks either. Like other match 3 games, you will hit a wall that makes you run out of lives. Also seems to not run particularly well if you have an older smartphone, since it seems to stutter a lot."
"Should have been an awesome game, 1 fatal flaw... the graphics and presentation are top notch. The huge problem with this game is that the screen doesn't scroll far enough when you walk!! Your character is almost always too close to the edge of the screen which gives you no time to spot enemies and start shooting them. You're just walking right into enemies before you have any time to react. Too bad."
"It is so mundane and easy. All the levels are the same. All the enemies are the same. Once 2 good weapons were leveled it was even easier. I played the first 60-75 floors with no armor getting 3*. Skill wheel is very irritating. You tap a skill and it closes. You open it back and tap again but it closes again. You do this 3 or 4 times before it registers or you die. Controls are so goddamn bad. Even with a controller, which it supports, controls are still garbage. Camera angle is so bad."
The game looks great but the controls are awkward and you can't back step and shoot at the same time. The camera follows you in a very awkward and dizzying you way. when you're low on the whole the whole screen turns a little too harsh of a red. Could not play this past 2 minutes
"An ok game limited by too many poor design elements. No tutorial, slow money-making (probably to encourage MTs), enemies spawning/teleporting right on top of you, & worst of all poor camera angles, which makes you spend most of the time shooting at stuff offscreen, using the minimap to aim, which makes it feel more like a game of asteroid. & since you're looking at the map so much, you don't see the enemies spawning next to you. Also refuses to give 3 stars on some levels."
"I had to rate this from 5 to 2 stars. The game is okay. The aim can be ackward as it doesn't lock onto targets as expected. Very terrible controls and bad camera angle and lacks the ability to adjust to character movements effectively. The stages are becoming so repetitive so it's getting boring. The only reward is the fact that you can get better guns, but it's because the enemies get harder to kill."
Came here after thoroughly enjoying Xenowerk Tactics. I must admit I was hugely disappointed 😥 The game is zoomed in too much and 50% of the time you end up with an enemy clawing at your face. The other 50% of the time you'll spend shooting in the general direction of enemies trying to hit them off-screen so the first thing doesn't happen. I couldn't get into it as the drunken camera and hyper-zoomed experience were too much. Waiting for Tactics 2.
"The game is relatively decent in terms of graphics but overall not recommendable cos the campaign sucks, the only customizable aspects of the game are the weapons and armour, the aim mechanism is god awful, the map is difficult to use cos you can't enlarge it and there is nothing in terms of waypoints here. The game needs a lot more work before it could go toe to toe with games like space Marshal. But good effort."
"Very fun gameplay. Simple, intuitive controls. But the game gets really frustrating when the levels get harder. Even with seemingly unlimited respawns, I find some of the boss monsters impossible. Guess you just need to spend real money to get better gear. Sad I have to quit the game."
"Tedious and poorly developed. It's good horrifically bad controls and a weird camera angle, where you have to rely on the overlaid map to know where enemies are coming from, but you don't know which kind until it's too late. There are no real missions, no sense of wonder, you just meander through empty corridors looking for aliens to shoot."
"The camera, virtual joystick and aiming is terrible. Character often turns in the wrong direction and when aiming will spin around and shoot in the wrong direction. The shotgun I had didn't even work either. I think this just controls terribly on a phone, even if the game itself could be sold."
Almost works.. Touch control limits (8 directional) also applied to controller when it should be limitless. Makes the controller useless/hard to aim/ operate. Will check for fix on next version. Unplayable as-is imo.
"actually, I like this game but it's hard to be comfortable with annoying view that always moving to give 3d experience.. for shooting, please add auto-aim or auto-fire, cuz you give overheat feature.. if this game for pc, maybe it would be a different experience, but now I just play it in phone btw, it's so hard to get the floor complete with perfect score like that ways :("
"Hard to control the movements. Even if you adjust the sensitivity to zero, the character is still hard to control. You can easily earn credits by watching ads but that is just too easy. You can have good weapons by just watching ads and not by playing the game in it. I recommend to limit the watching of ads for 3 ads each day so players will not do it frequently just to buy a weapon. Let them play the game to earn credits."
"2 Stars are for the fame olag machanism and smoothly, but couldn't be more. Because the floors' design are super close, always 4 kinds of monsters, no story line, not enough weapons and characters. And the map and view double rotation is frastrating. Needs lots of improvements."
"Potentially Good game but BAD v. BAD controls. The control buttn on left is all wonky with all the given settings in the options menu. It nvr lets ur character move in the direction you want it to move. Also, why do we have to slide to shoot on right action buttn? Why can't we just press the rt buttn to keep shootng? Pressng on right buttn instead keeps swapping the guns when we already have a separate icon next to it to swap guns. If dev wud fix movement, and shooting controls this game is 4/5."
Aim is horrible. You auto-target everything but the enemy swiping away at you. You literally turn your back and shoot a wall...when you have an enemy in your crosshairs 5 feet away. Camera is smashed down on top of your head - can't see anything. Very repetitive floors. Could be good - only reason I give 2 instead of 1.
Yeah I agree with many of the comments about its repetitive nature...although it has nice graphics I just couldn't continue the game. Space Marshals was much better and more tactical. And yes the camera is really bad... 80%if the time I'm relying on radar and firing on targets not even in the screen.
"I like the gameplay! Moving the character is OK. The aiming part is really bad! I hate it! Very difficult to aim! Hope there's an option where there's an auto aiming. Controls should be like the game ""Broken Dawn""."
the thing i mostly dislike is the camera. can't see anything and I'm basically moving in the map just watching the map in the corner cause it's the only way to understand if there are enemies. also aiming feels terribly difficult to me (using a gamepad)
"Graphics are great, movement is smooth but i uninstalled it because you cant really take an aim accurately and shoot enemies without being all over the place with the controllers designed this way. Fix that and it will be a hit"
the controls really are a bummer because other than that its a cool game. 5 star game if you could add some aim feature that will stick to the monters when moving so i can run back while i shoot. seeing my weapon swivle around like its out of control is comical at best.
"ok, the quality, gameplay, graphics etc was good. but the levels are the problem. Its boring when u have to go through floors. when ur done with the first level there's more and more."
"I absolutely hate the view you get, and it has awful aim. This game has a lot of stuff it needs worked on before i download it again. Didn't even get past the second level before Coming here. It looks like it would be a really fun game it the 3rd person view was better, and t he aim didn't glitch so much."
"Ok game, good graphics. It is sort of repetitive but fun. I would give a higher rating if the camera angle was adjustable, it needs a more forward view in most situations in the game."
The game feels a lot like Space Marshals 2 but it falls short in storyline and the controls are terrible. The levels feel repetitive with only more enemies each time. The game can be much better.
"The controls make this game nonplayable for me. You turn, run, & shoot the opposite way when trying to back up and is highly sensitive so locking on a monster (or even hitting) is almost impossible."
like the graphic style and the game play dont like that there isnt a separate button to fire you cant aim first which seems a little daft to me. also dont like that with the controller support the character moves forward constantly have tried with two separate controllers
I lovethe graphicsand music but the game play is to repetitive itnmade me feel like I wasn't even changing level same monsters and boring levelups. I really wish it would have more spontaneous aliens popping up. thank you for the game.
"I have given two stars only so you would notice, not because I dislike the game or anything. I like it a lot and would give it 5 stars any day. I played until very far in this game but when I just reinstalled it, the game logged into my old account and it shows my username and everything from before but all the progress is gone. On Google play games it still shows all my past achievements but it doesn't let me continue from where I left it. Could I be helped? Again, sorry for the two stars."
"The game is good but its repetitive and lacks creativity so much could've been added in the game but they wasted it a good opportunity, and the worst thing is the game has become Impossible at military base floor 10 level you move and you are dead"
Seemd good at first cuz i thort it was my fault i kept getting killed.but after the 50th time i realise its the controls that are failing me.everytime the character has been killd its due to the horrible controls.she constantly wants to shoot sideways and somtimes backwrds but rarely ever actualy at the enemy which has been the reason for her being killd every time.movments sketchy aswell.constantly having to reset the camera during a fight when already struggling to shoot.frustrating game
This game has good storyline and graphics. But the camera rotations and aiming isn't working for me. First floor mission got me headaches by roaming around. Space marshals 1 and 2 are better in terms of gameplay.
The controls are weird. When you move the game changes the camera view. It's difficult to aim straight and sometimes the controls seem to lock up.
"Difficult moving and aiming at enemies. Practice makes perfect. Although this evening I purchased $100,000 credits. They never appeared.?. Could not find any other method to contact.... anyone :^("
Graphics are okey but camera made me feel sick shooting was a pain I was just shooting all over the place which is down to very bad controls If these things got better I would have kept playing but I uninstalled simply because of the reasons I think the game could have been good but I dont wanna feel sick playing a game.
Wish there was control over view. It adjusts itself based on direction but often its frustrating and made me dizzy quickly. Targeting is difficult.
"i like the game the graphics but the control is so anoying I hate the controls how to aim and move if you fix the controls I think this game is great but now all I can give is 2 star.. and I think the game will be perfect if there is a story, thats all."
I think the controls are too slippy. I use Galaxy J6+ and the controls were fine when I play Space Marshals. But in this game the controls are a little bit hard to handle. I wonder why?
"Game gets boring because you can respawn endlessly (or maybe a bug), what's the purpose of life and powerups when we could just spawn right away? It's so hilarious i passed a hard stage for spawning endlessly."
Would be a good game but I find the camera movement hinders the entire experience and ad a result the contract suffer. You can center the camera but it is very inconvenient when you are fighting something.
Nice game... but view range for shooting have problem. I cant see enemy clearly to aim and shoot. Because of that firearms is useless when enemy only 1 feet from my face.
Pretty disorienting. The map should not move with the character. Graphics is ok but gameplay is almost the same.
The controls really suck so it's very hard to aim and control the shot so that's a 2 star. You can't even play the game if you die cuz they controls suck.
This could be a nice game. We need to be allowed to move clockwise & backward we also need a map that will show directions or an indication. Other than that this is the nice game.
"The game is okay, The graphics are great but theres not much content and its quite boring after doig the same repetitive missions and the guns are all just better versions of older ones but the game is repetitive"
aiming sucks balls!!!! total waste of time. no customized controls. dont waste your time if you're a real gamer. trust me.
the grinding got so repetitive that i actually uninstalled it. i mainly play mmorpgs so grinding doesn't bother me but this game doesn't offer many different levels and the levels are cramped. game was just really boring.
Controls are clunky aiming is difficult not fun. Looks good but struggling to hit enemies that are right next to you is a joke.
Graphics and sound design are decent but the fixed track camera angle is more than a little irritating and the firing controls are trash.
"Game is too good. People who say anything about the gameplay, i dont agree. It's ultra smooth and camera need not change. But... But... It's damn repetitive."
"The game is boring. You should have better weapons and different classes such as: assult, tech, medic, etc. Also the capeabillaty to name and choose your character."
Please change the camera angle. I have to guess I'm shooting a zombie cause I can't see them. And i don't know why every level feels like the previous one. Please improve something so this game feels fun.
This game is exciting and has crazy aliens to battle but the controls are terrible. There should be a button to fire.
This game could av been great but only one thing that spoils it but major major problem is the aiming and firing while on the move it is bloody terrible why not an auto aim or something I uninstalled it straight away bugger that frustration
"It's a cool premise abd the art is good, but the levels are repetitive and the controls are awful"
Controls are a disaster! Graphics are OK. Gameplay is dull and repetitive.
The graphics are great and mechanics work. Only problem is that it's way to easy and repetitive.
"The game was terrible. Poor graphics, poor gameplay, bad controls. Overall it was not a good game."
The game is not that optimize now. Before it didn't really have much of a fps drop. But todays version has a lot of fps drop.
this could have been way better. Aiming is very bad. and camera view is disturbing. i uninstalled the game just after 10 minutes.
Game would have been good if the camera view was higher. Can't see the mutants at which I'm shooting.
"The floors should have enough distance camera view in all angles, to know where to run to and fire the monsters."
This is more of frustration+trash than a game. You guys really need to work on this piece of garbage.
Having headache playing this game even for a short period of time. Aiming is really hard.
All is good but annolog is bad because they are not set the point for the shoot and also the key is not a good position
love it dude super addictive but I cant retrieve everything I got was close to beating the game almost got last armor and got great guns all gone now because I got a new phone thanks DELETE this
"The graphics of this game is ,and the gameplay is amazing"
Game is good but the controls are just idiotic. You can't aim and hit anything. Big shame
"Look like a loop, every stage feels same I would've given 5 star if location would've changed with every stage."
I'm not interested in a game that forces me to sign in to Google play! If there was a way to play without this requirement I wouldn't uninstall so soon
"Sorry, but it's a very boring game and the constant camera rotation drives me insane."
"Nice graphics but the weapons control is horrendous, really badly conceived."
Tried to shoot and instead the game kept changing weapons until i died. Not fun.
"Neat game, just gets super repetitive and has a lot of bugs."
It would be great if you could face the mutants and not be above the character.
The controls and aiming needs improvements
great concept nice control system just repetitive stages all the way.
"The game has great graphics, but I keep uncontrollably running in circles"
Really this type of game doesn't even want to have good graphics that could help it
The controls are pretty bad and the game feels baseless.
"Its gameplay is too difficult, and also sensitivity is very high,"
First game on mobile that makes me nauseous and the navigation is bad.
Game crashes every few minutes. Fix issue for better rank
Worst controls & cammera angle looking a game with good control.
Not much in way of interface and control.
"You can use a controller, but you cant shot with it!!!"
Controls are too hard to use and are very clunky
Some levels are impossible to pass through see into that plz otherwise iam going to uninstall it😂
You should get 3 star lvl with point but not killing all of enemy 🙄 I hope you can change it
"Game looks nice, but the camera makes it basically unplayable..."
"This game is available for TV, but doesn't load accurately."
Its good game but repetitive and no level progression its .
Movement and aiming is no good for this type of game.
Game concept is good but worst view angle to hard to play worst controls
"Controls are difficult to aim, not that entertaining"
repeatitive ..same kind of actions..change is in only..increase in number of monsters...huh boring
"The aiming is not great, otherwise kinda cool looking"
Fun excellent graphics but lacking goal oriented story
Good shooting game but no storyline kind of boring in a way
"What's the hell with the camera angle, if you're going to give a top view then do so, why the hell can I only see like 2cm around my character and the TPP is worse."
I can be playing the game normally. Going on missions to rack up some momey for upgrades. Then BAM it starts lagging extremely hard. I can play multiple levels without lagging. It's smooth. Then outta nowhere it lags really hard to the point that if I try to exit it out the game entirely it freezes my phone. But after I close the app & log back on it's fine. I have no idea why it does this. It's literally random & it happens in the middle of a mission. It's never at the start.
"Fun game, I'd almost say addicting. Storyline is cut pretty short which is a huge bummer. Stops at south america and should continue into russia and other countries. There's other stuff to keep busy and have fun but storyline was best. I found out thru other players in chat that I was on the last storyline and I just made a purchase, gladly it wasn't an expensive purchase, so be warned. Given the game was introduced in 2013? I don't believe they're working on a storyline or intend to do so."
"Thought the game looked like fun. 1st two missions went okay, then the game started locking and unlocking. Then it froze with the sound of the wind still going. No controls worked. Game is unplayable. And..some of the text is unreadable because its so small. Will uninstall. Edit: Gave it a 2nd chance. Too hard for me. I ALWAYS die and never have enough $ to purchase upgrades. Not fun to never win."
"It's fun, but three big problems: 1. I dont like the idea of having an account. At least let us sign in as a guest, or let us delete our account, instead of having to contact you to do so 2. The blueprint RNG isn't fair, and you're always one blueprint off from everything. At least give us the option to choose one from 3 item blueprints to take 3. Be able to move your purchases to other accounts It's a fun game, but these turn me off it a lot. If you updated it to put these on, I would love that"
"Disappointing. Actual game play is fun, but it takes literally days to upgrade Tech and other stations. RIDICULOUS! You can't continue main missions unless you upgrade the Tech and that means waiting 2-3 days. Unless, of course, you are willing to spend real money to upgrade. Upgrading/building weapons and other resources takes waaaaaaay too long as well."
"The game is great and the graphics was amazing and stunning but there's a big problem. Every time that I finished a task, it always stuck in the loading screen and it never move forward. Hopefully you could fix on this one because it's really amazing and this was one of my childhood game."
The game is fantastic just there is some issues in my opinion the first issue is that it opens up the little download apps to get more gold and once you click off of it completely get rid of your sound which I like the sound and secondly it takes days for you to upgrade your characters which sucks in my opinion.
"This game is so good the graphics was stunning but the bad about it is after you finish the mission you'll get stuck in the loading screen, then if you restart the game you need to repeat the mission again. Please fix this bug,i want to play the game"
"It's a fun game, what would make it better is if the sound actually stayed on. It works fine upon opening the app, but dies the second that dang ""get free gold"" offers page pops up and won't come back smh. Please fix this issue."
There's a bug which is preventing me to fire the gun manually. I have restarted the game twice and nothing has happened. I switch to manual but there is no button to fire and also I am softlocked into the sniper missions because of it. Please tell if there's a fix for it.
"When I finish a mission, the loading screen will be stuck. If I close the game, the mission that I just finished will be restarted again. Please fix this bug because it ruined my gameplay."
"This game seriously needs a major quality of life update. it looks horrible on the fold 4. Theres no anti-aliasing. The field of view is so tight it's disorientating at times. The main menu where you upgrade etc is to this day, still in 1:1 ratio and doesn't fit the screen after all these years. this game is fantastic but it needs some life and new content."
Bad no sound I played one level after that the sound just stopped I've taken the game off and put it back on my tablet many times I've also maid sure there is plenty of space on my tablet the game runs fine just there is no sound after first level but all my other games run fine sound and everything so I don't understand.
"Nice game! but everytime I complete a mission, loading screen freezes and I have to play that mission again!!! I reinstalled it after many days still no improvement. 😒"
"Since 2019, there was finally an update, now in 2023. I didn't played the game since then as I was busy with a thing called life, but my nostalgia got the better of me and I decided to install it back and play a bit just to get that old feeling. Well, I must say I was really disappointed to see that nothing changed at all and that the sound is completely dead in the game, no matter what you do."
When you play the mini game for gold as soon as you touch anywhere it resets. It resets your odds as soon as you barely miss the button. I love this game but theres more than a few money making aspects that suck
"One of the very few games I've spent money HOWEVER 50% of times It freezes AFTER completing a mission, on exiting screen, after the rewards count. After restarting you discover that the mission was not counted as done, the rewards not given and you have to play again, and see if it will freeze or not after playing. 50-50 chance again to freeze on victory screen, and you need to kill the app and play it again. And again. And again... Until the com toss accepts your play and you can proceed"
"During game play, the words that come up in middle of screen block the view! Like sentinel mode when""zombie entering critical zone"" for example. And during game play as well"
"Always lagging in loading screen si B have to turn off. Then game restarts, my progress isn't saved at all. That's honestly my only gripe cause gameolay is fun, but that is a deal breaker."
Game and graphics are great! But whenever the ads on where you can get more gold shows up the sound or background music of my game suddenly goes mute. This disappoints me I need to close the game first before the sound comes back but the ads come back again and again so the background music of the game disappers after that pop up.
"This is the best game I have ever played me and my cousin,friends we all used to play this game but once I updated the game everything just restarted I had the m1 garand m16 mp40 jackhammer dual glocks and it's really f up that I have to try the whole thing again but it still is the best game I have ever played just please try to fix this issue"
Not able to play Russia rounds as it is not appeared after opening level or upgrading tech. Any one help me in this case as I am stopped and able to play any more
Awesome game but the ad page mutes the game and even I'd I restart the game it comes up.and mutes it again. Its a shame bc it's a great game but I can't play it with no sound.
The free gold ads pops ups when I start the game and then the volume becomes mute.... pls fix this it is quite annoying. But the game is epic👍👍
It is a good game but the problem is everytime i obtain a new blueprint after the mission the screen froze pls fix this cause the game is fun
"This game is my childhood and and all but GODDAMN, the loading screen takes HOURS TO LOAD. And my device and internet connection isnt even bad so I have to repeat the whole level again. Plus the ads always stops the sound which makes the gameplay awkward. Im dissapointed but I understand that developing a game is hard so take you time."
I really love the game. It just sometimes after I finish a mission it just force at the loading screen. I say sometimes it freezes not all the time. It's really annoying.
"Would have given it a 5 but that ONE AND ONLY add at the beginning immediately mutes all sound for the entirety of your play. I disconnect my headphones then reconnect and still no sound. So i start the game over, and have sound, same start up ad pops up and then i have no sound again. Restarting my Bluetooth headphones does not work. Restarting the game does not work. Really just not an enjoyable experience without ANY sound."
Oww so sad i cant play dead trigger 2 offline it needs to on data when you open the app sheessh :( i wish theres offline mode edit: ahmm wait can you do an auto gamepad config so we dont need to setup the buttons 1by1
Due to Advertisement from tapjoy Music and sound in game gets off automatically and it can't be fixed to fix that i have to restart the game again and again
"Nice graphics, great zombie shooting game. The only downfall is that I don't have any sound🤨"
U know what i like this game a lot but. But when u play a mission i mean complete a mission it just gets stuck on the loading screen like brah i am so pissed btw u get ur powerups back so that's a thing anyway thats the only problem with that game to me except that very good game and please i am begging remove that bug.
Its good but it gets stuck on loading screen because of that i loose my progress everytime and this is really frustrating to play again and again but i never the same blueprints again and after killing 300+ zombies we get is nothing only because of loading screen being stuck
Stuck on loading screen after finishing a tasks missions and need to exit in order for it work again please fix this problem
It was fun to play until it wasn't.. the sound when you go into the game the sound will go off. And then when you start to play with the motor the motor will be shooting but it won't be exploding in the zombies just keep on coming..
I've played this game before overall the game is really good...but now when i download it during sniper missions the shoot button is not available hence can't progress without finishing the missions.. Pls solve this issue soon
I was enjoying this game but every time I do a particular mission (the one in Africa in the mine) after completing it there is an endless loading screen making further progress impossible.
"It is not offline, game crashes loses progress, after completion stuck in loading screen and lose progress, I'm afraid of future levels that requires more time."
"Fairly decent. There seems to be a decent storyline and the mechanics are simple, ita fairly fun even after playing it for a while. The issue i have with it is sometimes after completing a mission i get stuck on the loading screen, no matter how long i wait, so i have to restart the app. But when i do i have to do the mission again and hope that i don't get stuck on the loading screen this time. Please fix this bug, it's frustrating."
"The game is great and I really loved the gameplay and storyline. It's really one of the best fps zombie shooter out there. The reason I am giving it 2stars is because when I complete a mission the game freezes on the loading screen. It kinda became annoying after a few tries, so, I uninstalled it but if the problem gets fixed I am willing to play it again.."
I really love the game. In fact this is the best zombie survival game I've ever played. But sometimes I found that when I finished a story mode and on the back home loading screen it's start to freeze and won't load until I restart the game. Not only just the freeze bug also the money and the blueprint you earned in those will also disappear from your inventory. And I have to restart the same level progress. Please fix it. Thank you.
"The controls are as smooth as butter! Edit : I'm reducing 3 stars because now a days it's facing connectivity issues. After finishing time consuming and difficult missions and winning hard earned points, the game suddenly gets stuck at loading screen. So I have to force close and reenter. Thus losing all my points and perks. It's super annoying and just unfair. Please fix it."
Game is good but it keeps getting freeze after completion of mission which feels like waste of time
Guys plz fix the issue the game cant differentiate between boom egg and boom chicken eveytime I selected boom chicken it shows selected but while playing mission boom egg 🥚 comes up .
"I like the game very much. But,when I complete a mision and claim my rewards, sometimes I stuck and can't claim my rewards. It is my request to fix the bug to MADFINGER GAMES"
I enjoyed playing Dead Trigger 2 but it's really frustrating when after completing my mission the app freezes and does not save my progress so I need to keep repeating missions once it reloads. I thought I was the only one having this problem. It was already raised by many players and it's just disappointing that it still keeps happening.
The game is very good but the only problem is that there are no missions after South America
Great game madfingir my pov the game is awesome 👍but whenever I completed a level is get stuck in loading screen so 2 star
"Great game, easy controls and layout. Like the storyline, not many adverts to watch unlike lots of other games, but why spoil it by having such long periods before the next campaign, now up to 20 mins between next campaign and im only on the second country. I don't pay real cash for any game, unless there less than £1, I appreciate that devs need to earn money from ads, but to proceed any faster you have to spend huge amounts to buy gold. Got fed up of waiting for next level so uninstalled."
"I give this 2 star please fix the sound because it always disappears every time you play, thank you"
Nice game.. But after a game its stucks needs to reopen and play that level once more
The game is awesome but it freezes right after the missions
"Dear developer, This game is very amazing but the problem from the update is that whenever I got blueprint in any game and going back to hideout I gets stuck on the loading screen and then when I restart the game It does not show any progress. My humble request to you is to fix this issue as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation."
"Game is good, the graphic is good and movement so cool,but there's a big problem when the mission complete the loading screen was stock im not sure if natural to this game but when I restart the game the mission is repeat and I need to complete the mission again, is annoying.I hope this game issue would fix because this game is so cool."
"The game always freezes after you spend a little more time during a mission than intended. It freezes after completion, forcing you to close the game and bear with losing all of the money/blueprints you collected during that level. Also, tournaments don't show up on my account for some reason. They do show up on my other, low level account, but don't at my main (Lvl 44). Hope the devs will look more into this and attempt to fix this"
"The gameplay is good. But it throws away the fun after completing the SouthAmerican chapter, since the next chapters have no story at all, the storyline was abandoned by the developers mid-story. It is very short and after grinding all the money to updgrade to the tech that unlocks Russia, the gameplay becomes the most repetitive it can be just doing sidequests all over the place. It doesnt seem worth playing after you beat where the developers left the story, which is in the middle of the game."
"Game is good only, but what is this bug that hangs the game after mission, some mission takes so much effort to complete, utter nonsense."
"Played this game 2yrs ago, nothing new. Same old levels, takes 2 long upgrading. Do not rate the way gold is earned, 2 many 3rd parties involved never used 2 b like this."
I had fun. The graphics and animation is good but after they got away in the van with the titan it always stops. Or is it just bugs? 🤔
Game freez on loading screen after completion of a mission . When you restart th game you lose your progress of that current mission. Resolve the issue.
I'll give 2 stars because I keep having to re install the game to fix a bug where when I get that stupid first add my game goes mute. Btw not even that is working anymore.
I have been playing this game since six years. Now when I start playing all sound is off.It is too boring to play this good game in mute. Please update my issue.
"My experience started good... until the overwatch missions where you had to use a weapon which requires you to press a shoot button, however what the game didn't do was add said shoot button, I messed with the settings sought out help (the website was useless) I tried 're installing it but that did nothing. I would recommend it, just if that but gets fixed."
I this update my sound music is mute sound is not hearing and coming fix it quickly
I love the Simplicity of the game. Thanks a lot. Improvement required: 1. Graphics - need to improve a lot with some extra effects. 2. Annoying wait time between missions - Yes I understand if there was no wait time then gamers can finish all campaigns within no time. Just 20min wait time for 2-3min mission is bad. Increase the mission time with some interesting story line. 3. Tech upgrade time - 4 Days to upgrade tech and weapon makes us loss interest. Lost interest Etc....
"Its not offline. Every time you turn data off, you start the game from the beginning again."
Seems like it would be a decent game if your advertisements didn't mute the sound. Not interested in playing without sound.
"I can't play Africa campaign,""got your back"" mission. Please do some thing about it,or show me how, cause it won't fire auto or manual. And ""Sentinel mission"" also won't fire...!!!"
"I've only comeback after some months knowing that Dead Trigger 2 is still receiving updates even to this day. Unfortunately, my experience lately has been spoiled due to a bug that keeps me on the loading screen after finishing a mission. Please fix this issues, Madfinger. I was really hoping to get into the new weapon sales but now decided against it due to the game being unplayable."
"I mean the game is good but it could have been better if u add more levels after south america, because it kinda feels boring after that. The graphics are also great and the gameplay is quite interactive. I dont understand why, but if i play a game for a lil kore tym, the game freezes on the loading screen, please fix this as i really like this game."
love this game but when game finished and go lobby it stucked please fix this bug
"I told myself I wasn't gonna write a review, until I saw the bad and the ugly of this game. I did the extra earn gold for free mission, guess what? I didn't get it becuz the missjon wasnt available anymore even though I just took the mission for 1 min and it was already gone. There's not even new campaigns after south america. Plus the upgrades and building new guns take too long. Bad I say! Bad! I'm still gonna play this game for the fun....but you people better shape up this game properly"
"Game is rigged a lot you upgrade your weapons via spending money on the app and they make the enemies harder to kill ""cash grab app"" plus side its compatable with a blue tooth controller and entertaining a lil"
Needs more story levels and options to get stronger without paying to win. I basically finished the game in a week. I tried to play the random levels for a month longer but it got so pointless without the pay to win. You don't get new weapons once you beat the story. So your just struggling with weak weapons and strong zombies. I don't mind the ads if the game is playable after story mode.
"There is a bug in africa campaign - the fixer where the game will stuck at loading screen and if you restart the game the mission will be count as failed, the other missions are working properly. Hope you can fix that issue Edit: it's not just on that specific stage, all of the stage in campaign are like that"
"Infuriating! Far too much upgrade this, upgrade that, buy this, buy that, constant pop ups on the screen. The gameplay can be very frustrating aswell. Guns are never powerful enough, they take forever to upgrade, and when you eventually do, it's totally pointless because the zombies have upgraded aswell. Is there nobody who can produce a decent FPS?"
"I'm making my rating now from 5 stars to 2 stars because of this annoying bug in the loading screen. Whenever I complete missions the 2nd time after I open the game, it stucks in the loading screen and I am always forced to restart the app and then find out that my progress wasn't saved at all. This bug kinda ruins the fun and my grinding. If you fix this asap, I'mma return my rating into 5 stars, guaranteed. But if it takes longer, I'mma rate it 3-4 stars next time."
"It's fun, I recommend it for a game to waste time on. Although the blue prints for weapons don't spawn as fast as necessary, and the difficulty of the zombies raises a little too quickly. Also I personally don't like how low the character states are, and unlike the first one, can't upgrade."
"Everytime I finnish one mission, it keeps freezing and now you gonna start all over again. All my efforts from killing zombies and doing some mission was nothing. I can't even go further because it keeps freezing and crashing resulting going from the start of the game again and again even though my internet connection is strong. I hope I get a response about the problem, this is one of my favorite game so far. The recent update wasn't working, the game still crashes."
this gane is good but in this have loading screen promble pls fix it
"Didn't like the game. I played and uninstalled this game multiple times, and every SINGLE time it only gives me blueprints for the knife and ithaca. I get that might be good enough for people to start off with, but after that its just random blueprints, and you don't know how long it took me to get 1 crossbow blueprint. All i can say is: at the start mix things up a bit, and don't make blueprint farming so time consuming."
"I've just recently played this game and i almost fell in loved with it all the way from its gameplay, controls , graphics and the fact that its not pay to win which made me addicted to it but even though this game is one of the best zombie shooter i ever played, theres one big reason if why i will never be able to rate it w/ 5 stars yet, cuz everytime i finished a mission it just suddenly freezes and i lost my progress along with it. So for now i'll just uninstall it till you fix this problem."
Graphics are mediocre. Gameplay is borderline. What really killed the game for me was playing a Sentinel match and I realized the ammo was auto-seeking. I didn't even need to aim at the actual target and the ammo would veer off and hit the target anyway. It's ridiculously boring to just sit there holding the fire button without even having to aim.
"I enjoy the game, minus all the click bate and overloaded promotions. Can't select hard difficulty while using a gamepad or other controller on my TV. Please update the button levels to allow a right joystick or d-pad input to select hard difficulty. Really frustrating and should be a basic operation for gameplay. I know we can do better guys."
"This game is absolutely amazing and addictive. I did not rate it 5 stars (which is what it really deserves) b/c this game does not allow you to get to other levels. Once you get to Russia, the game does not allow you to actually play the stages of that country. I have read this complaint more times than I can count. This is A HUGE ISSUE and VERY FRUSTRATING! The inability to be awarded some of the perks; weapons, gold and further game advancement is why I would love a response/solution."
"Amazing game, I love it, but Half of the times that I finish a mission the game just freeze and I can't keep playing. I will wait an actualization to play it with no fear to freeze my progress after each mission!"
gameplay is FANTASTIC unfortunalely you are locked to timed upgrades and timed missions meaning you have to wait to actually play through the game regardless if you want to or not. Also the high level gun upgrades take 3+ days. I wish i could say this game is one of the best. because the gameplay certainly is. i just wish i could say the same about the upgrades and pacing of the game. unless your willing to spend money to speed up progression and buy gold to get more weapons dont waste your time
Again getting same issue in Africa Campaign. Game is getting stuck on next window when I clear The Fixer level.
"After several hours you play the game, it make me bored. Below are the reason: 1. Gameplay and mission keep repeating. 2. Excesive long just to update item. It forced you to use real money just to make it faster. 3. Tonnes of unrelevant ads during loading. The only good of this game is the immersive graphic. Not reccomended game."
"It's a decent game. It would be better if it was sustainable without having to spend money. But the game is designed to make the most money in the least amount of time. Like look I get it, it costs to create and maintain a game. On the other hand, maybe consider players that don't have cash to spend on games. Make it sustainable for everyone. The cost to upgrade your equipment and hideout is ridiculous. THEN there's the notifications in game that are right on top of your FOV. 👎"
"New update is riddled with bugs. Text appearing in the wrong places, Zombies that are invincible (to both bullets and explosives) and character being teleported to the dark dimension (out of map), having to quit or die. Madfinger, plz check this and fix them. Love this game, even with the BS pay-to-win stuff, but these bugs have been made the game less playable. Edit: Stuck in store section for gold and cash. Requires restart of the game. Tournaments and Warfare doesn't record score."
"When your primary method of gaming requires use of a controller, then I hope the support would be good. However, although this game supports controllers, the actual use feels terrible. It's definitely a game with controller support as an afterthought. Unfortunately, because of the lackluster experience, I cannot reccomend this game (if you use a controller). Next!"
"The gameplay is better than DT ""1"" But... * Why put notices right in the middle of the screen? * 1st DT let you use your coin and gold to buy the weapons. Here you get blueprints that takes ages to collect & build. *Wait time for upgrade of techs. 2 days!!!! Seriously? All of the above is so you will buy stuff from the store but the prices are ridiculous! $79 for a few pixels!! Everyone has the right to make money & I pay reasonable amounts but this is just greed. It's a mobile game FFS!"
"My experience on dead trigger 2. There seem to be a bug in the system, when after up grade my tech to level 7, there is no level available to pay. I upgraded my tech to level 9 and there is still no level to play in Canada, Australia and another country. Please fix this"
"Even after almost 8 years, this game looks good for a mobile game, but thats it. First hours are fun but later the grinding part comes in and monotony. You can spend entire game's round (15 or 20 min idk) and you don't receive blueprint for any gun. Also, there are some special guns that you can only unlock by using real money and pricing for them are mindblowing. and there's ad problem that after you finish round it shows without any reward for wasted time. Overall, grindy and waste of time."
"Game is very repetitive , the zombies just keep coming which interrupts you to admire the environment or graphics, only different thing are the sentinel missions , hidden secrets are also difficult to find , getting new weapons is too hard , it takes too long to play next mission , to summarize u have to be very patient to play this game"
"Unfortunately as of today, I couldn't play the game. TapJoy is crashing the game every few seconds after I'm in my Hideout, frequent ""infinite loading"" screens, causing me to lose progress on a mission forcing me to do it again. These caveats hinder the game in a large scale, and I can't enjoy this properly."
"The game is very fun to play, but the problem are that you have to wait 20 minutes between each mission on every continent. Now the worst part is after level 5 there are no more mission. It is like Madfinger just gave up on this game, which in my opinion is the best game Madfinger ever created. So look forward to lots of fun for the first week then boom nothing. So don't waste time spending real money if u decide to play it anyway. Just grind side missions the get a shotgun and assault rifle."
"What's wrong with the customize layout, i tried to put the reloading button to the left side but when i started to play the game it is on the right side instead, checking the settings again to customize, the button wad on the left itself, but when i resume the game, it is still on the right screen... This is a bug, fix it"
"This game has the worst screen design i think i have ever come across. The icons are too large with horrible placement that suffocates the players view and leaves no place for the subtitles. Because of this they place the subtitle smack in the middle of the screen effectively blinding the player, and then they fail to provide a way to toggle of subtitles off so that this does not happen. Poor design, do not recommend"
"I'm verry sorry I didn't like the app. The controlls never showed an option for onscreen controlls, just cotroller controlls. Besides that, the graphics were amazing and the sound quality was splendid. Also there is barely any ads! If the game could be fixed, this would be one of the best zombie games ever. Until then, I will have to keep my eye on the game for any updates. Thank you!"
"10x better than the second game, which is time locked behind the BS energy system and has more MTX in your face. However, they seem to have locked it to the worst control scheme since I first played 5+ years ago to try and make people play the second. On these controls your movement will frequently lock up as the game seems to only be able to handle one input at a time. 5 stars if I could still change controls. Makes no sense to remove it other than money motivation."
I don't like it. You are on a rail moving forward in a field of zombies at night in black and white. You can move left or right and try to get weapons lighted boxes while zombies lunge for you. The goal is how far in before you run out of ammo or a zombie grabs you. You go forward on a moving rail ... You can go slightly right or left. You keep trying to go farther.
"Game is well made but the experience is a little trash. Barely anywhere to go, going through the forests is ridiculous with like 5 trees in a tight line and 4 zombies behind. Not only that but the pov is hard to see with a massive weapon in your face, should be moved down a little. But yeah there's barely anywhere to navigate through and the loot is terrible everytime"
I am also having a touch screen issue with controls. I like tapping the left or right side of my screen. This is not working. Other controls work but i do not like them at all. Please tell me why this doesnt work or try to fix. I have an LG V60 ThinQ...its an Android.
"There is only one control setup !? Why there is no multiples like tilts and buttons ? Major disappointment. I've played this before 2 years, at that time it had 4 control setups. But now it has one and it is default too..."
"Map 3 Broken Game -The free guns are pretty good except for the basic revolver-more useful as a paperweight. Needs a drop button. Few premium weapons are worth the time. Basic game play is flawed-erratic glancing/ instant death, certain weapon`s sounds play thruout entire run, map 3 (hardcore) constantly presents wrong/ unselected weapons"
Extremely good game but there's a slight problem ... the game control is stuck in the controller mode and i also don't have a controller. So am not able to play the game ... pls fix it ... otherwise everything is alright.
"Quiett strange that how this game got 4.6 rating!!!!!! The game is good in the first 2 days of playing and later becomes a big disappointment because all the stages are having the same look and feel, location , design environment and nothing is changed even a single bit. Be it CLASSIC, MASSACRE or HARDCORE mission.. ALL OF THEM R EXACTLY THE SAME WITH JUST DIFFERENT TITLES."
"Review:- Into The Dead - Just For Few Thrills. Rating:- 2.75/5. On whole the verdict of this game, is just for few Thrills only. The concept of killing roots is good but the gameplay does not show enough. Graphics is good but. We still want some thrills and excitement, but the gameplay and execution are not yet impressive."
"This game at start will be great. It has graphics ,gameplay. But then it becomes boring as the man is running straight until a zombie catches. There has to be some change."
I loved this game until the broke the controls its an controller favourable setup but I'm used to the gyro moments and the button don't response I've been playing this game for a while please please give some custom control options or make it like it was used to be the right section of the controls is broken please i want to play but i can't.
Why do i need a controller to play this. No on screen controls are given. I ve played this using a dualshock 4 wireless controller and its laggy which is understandable considering its not tuned for mobile phones. But so far no on screen controls are available rendering this unplayable
way to much lags! doesn't work on my Android TV. it used to work on my Android TV but not anymore. I see a lot of complaints. PLEASE FIX THIS!
"Pretty lame, it looks like a 1st person shooter but all you can do is turn slightly left or right to dodge zombies as you run forward. You can get weapons"
"I mean good graphics,but boring,you literally just run straight,or lean left or right and didge zombies,or shoot if you have a gun,but just run straight,over and over and over,its the definition of insanity lol doing the same thing over and over"
"Great, just great. I recently bought a redmi 7 and it just so happens that the controls for this game happen to NOT WORK, even though I've played and thoroughly enjoyed this game for many years, on phones with the specs no better than a Gameboy. SMH..i'm highly disappointed in you guys"
"You start each run from the chopper unarmed and you get weapons from crates. My issue is with the targeting and use of said weapons. No real way to aim and your shoot buttons are also your move buttons....aka touch the screen. Not cool guys, not cool."
It used to be all right but now you have to buy all the weapons with cash. If you don't spend money out will never get any decent scores. describable!
"Ive played this game before and i love it, but when i try to play it now the only thing thats showing up un settings is the controls for a gamepad and the ojly touch controls that work are to navigate the menus. I dont know why its doing this but i dont know how to change it"
"It is one of my favourite games, but there is a problem with control type 2 (touch control), it doesn't work properly. Right hand works but left hand doesn't. It's disappointing to have."
Love this game. I downloaded it on my Apple TV. But sadly for phone version it kind of sucks because of the controls. Sometimes even when I press hold on my left/right screen it does not follow the movement. So I'm uninstalling it now.
"Im so tired of just dying every time I try to glance off of a zombie, where is the line to be drawn where at one point you glance off and the next you just die. Other than that, game is fine. Please fix the glancing"
Game used to be good but I can't even play it now. Almost never turns unless I'm tapping an inch away from the edge of the screen and at that point I click to shoot.
"It's the best graphics and the best game. In zombie games, only one coin is hard to collect, and the Salah needs to be connected to the Internet to open some of the Salah. If it's offline, it's better."
Game Is now unplayable without a controller for some reason. Motion/Touch controls no longer work an there is no way to even see them as a option in the setting menu.
I previously had a review and I reviewed it like 5 stars. But after the. Latest update and visual feature changes my potato phone started lagging. I rly hope you the dev read this. Can you make in ge settings lowers graphics for people like me cuz I'm a big fan and I have been playing for a while now
Decide to get back and saw that the graphics is toughy even more than into the dead 2.... It is nice to make updates but on right way.... This way for me isn't the right way....
"On my old phone, this game worked perfectly and was alot of fun and now I got a new phone and now it says that I have to play with a controller, I don't know why it says that in the controls but I hopw they can fix it soon. thank you"
Game is good but it should be like we could go in open world or just sit high enough and snipe them with unlimited ammo or just go to anywhere on map and find guns and supplies but its boring just keep running😑
The game did not download because I wanted to play it because it looks fun but eventually just kicks me out of downloading it and it doesn't download is keeps popping up the same thing it did not download so you can fix it can you please fix it.
"horrible controls, cant even move back a forth. change the controller back to the tilt or touch control. thankyou."
I am not able to controll the charecter because i cant change the controll settings it is showing something like a joystick.. And iam playing android version.. I played it in motion mode before but now am not able to do it any one please help
"This game was my favourite. But after long time when I installed this, I'M UNABLE TO CHANGE CONTROLS FROM CONTROLLER TO TOUCH MODE. I DONT HAVE CONTROLLER !! Can't figure out how to change controls to touch"
There is no controls for mobile . Default control setting is joystick which is annoying to play this game anymore. It used to have controls button before. Why the contols are not showing?
I'm playing this game in a mobile but the controls in it are of a controller. I simply run straight. please change it if not this is the worst game i have ever played
"I loved this game, but it's sequel isn't available on my samsung L3 or my tablet. I beat the whole game and was beaming when I saw the sequel was going to be released in 2017, but it wasn't, and still isn't combatible with any of my devices. Please make this game compatible with more devices. =("
"Way too many ads to even enjoy this game, otherwise pretty fun. At least make the ads just pictures or videos you can close."
I thought it would be like fight zombies but is doesnot seems like that when i downloaded it the game its just run and run and run its soo bore but its just aa running game not much😴😴😴😴 control also a bit strange
I'm giving this game 2 stars because it was just time pass. They could have made a better game. All you've to do is run in same direction and dodge zombies and kill them while running. Game has very dark background which makes your eyes pain.
this game used to be one of my favorite games all you have to do to make it one of my favorite games again is put different control settings in it because most of us with a phone can't connect a game controller to it
I think this game is good but it wont let me change my control settings and the tap to start shooting doesn't work.
"Worst Gameplay Control is not smooth. Why shouldn't introduce some button to fire! Frequent adds. To play once coin is needed, to get the coin watch adds. Why such apps exist? To push adds only?"
The game wont let me switch controls. it says i have a controller attached and wont let me change to just tilting the screen.
It used to be one of the my favourite game but this new update won't let me change the control mode and its show a Xbox controller I thought this is only my problem but I found out my friend has the same problem too my phone is a Xioami redmi note 10 and my friend phone is Xioami redmi note 10 pro so I decided to try on my old tablet Samsung galaxy Tab 3 and it's work fine I'm not sure it's only New phones problem or Xioami phones but pls fix this problem for lord sake I love this game thanks
"game was fun, just recently reinstalled it and i dont have any control options other than a controller. can't play at all."
"A good game with nothing much in it . I think controller can be improvised, armory should have in game purchase . Like not everyone wants to spend his real money for an in game machinegun ."
I tired playing it. But there was controller controls. Earlier they used to be touch based. How am I supposed to do controller setup on phone?
"I really like to give more stars,, but the control is different now,, i connot play on touch screen, tis use to be one of my favorite game, but things have change 🤷‍♀..."
"I like the game,but there are so many ads🙁.i uninstall it...if you fix this on the another update im going to install it again...i gave 1 star for the graphics 1 star for the features"
I like the game but it crashes sometimes and in the beggining it didnt do this but then after a few days it started to crash
It was a great experience but there were other things I did not like e.g. Wile playing the game adds some how show up and then you lose that's what I don't like about the game
This game is really amazing. But it contains too many adds. Although it contains good graphics and sensitivity
A little class goes a long way if I have to see an ad within 40 seconds of playing this game or any game immediate uninstall seriously have some class
Althought its great but its just a like a dash game thing like u ran forever dogde every enemy/builds/blocks like that like example sonic dash like that so make another one that we can explore everytging with friends
"I don't know which type of game is this because, the only one way is here and you have to run and shoot the zombies which is very boring ."
The game is really good but when i again installed the game after uninstalling it i lost all my achievements and the tasks i had completed even after saving it on google play games...
What's with the new bad control setup..... It's slow and honestly not quite good... I don't think it's something the game needed
No update please update this game and improve this into nonpayment for real money only for weapons and make it free to use all the weapons to kill zombies and improve graphics.
alright I bought the minigun and maybe some other things too and now it shows that I haven't unlocked my minigun plus all my progress is gone it's been a few years since I played this game
It's just as it was. Boring. I come back to it like not long time ago and uninstalled it after playing for 5 minutes. Coz it's sucks
"I am not able to play this game on my redmi note 7 pro, it needs comtroler to play the game i am not able to control the character i am trying to change control but it is showing me a ps4 controler"
these should be such simples controls and yet somehow they made them nigh unusable. The game will just eat your inputs half the time...
"I'm playing this game on my oppo f9 device, and The game didn't have full display in notch area the notch area is empty! Fix this and don't recommend service e-mail 'cause i already mail you. Thanks 👍"
Good game but add some characters with abilities and online battles bonus coins so that we can enjoy the game.
"No story not sure how to progress further, I'll try out the sequel, good graphics thou. Chainsaw sucks!"
my family loves playing this game but recently the lags are terrible please fix it I have purchased bundles and would like to play
Cannot play. only shows controller controls and I cannot change to tilt or thumbstick controls.
It is a fantastic game but the adds are too frequent and force you to watch add videos . Unbearable.
what happened to the controls? you cant move to avoid them anymore... now you just run in a straight line to you get killed
Is that all? Just running forward and killing zombies? Boring and repetitive. With the reviews on here I expected more.
"am not getting the gravity control option in the game, though I have played this game with gravity control before."
Please you guys should add new environments to the game mean it been... over 5!! years please I like this game BUT the OLD scenery gets very BORING!!! 😭 😡
"The game play could be better the only reason I checked it out was because the 2nd game is really good, but this one has no storyline."
"You know when I try to download it,it takes to long and I need to waits in 2 hours although my line is 4G+.That is the reason I give 2 star."
"I can't control with touch or swipe, it show no option of control but a game controller of a console why is that ols help me"
It's ok i guess but all you do is run?It get's boring after 2minutes.I thought you build a base or investergate?
"I have experienced this game and then i uninstalled it for a while, but when i installed it back it wouldnt even start."
The graphics are great and all but i cant find the preffered controls im playing on a redmi note 8 pro
It used to be a good game until they added new weapons and items locked behind the paywall.
I used to love this game but you changed the controlles to a controller i play this on phone this is not what i want to post please Fix really
"its great , the way of getting coin is easy and good graphics too great work , great game"
Why the hell there is no tilt on control options. It shows me only controller and i don't have it!
Difficult controls The contols do not allow you to move well. Unrealistic movement.
"guns r fun , most else sux . what's point of choosing 3 weapons only to pick up something else . STUPID"
Its a good game but the left and right controllers doesn't work and i end up dying
Game constintly force closes app. Cant get 2 runs in before crashes....hesitant on making a purchase
The major drawback of this game was why not make a mission wise objectives game rather than a endless game cmon i hate it add other not endless mission too
The game is good but the controlling is not so good plz improved the controlling of the game.
After the update it doesn't start and keeps showing a black screen after pikpok logo.
there are awesome guns in the game that i like but i don't like how i have to pay for them with real money.
Thers a glitch wich makes the game think that i am using a controller to play. Is ther a way to disable the controller in the game
Uninstall after 5min play. The gameplay is plain stupid. Auto run? Really?
"it seemed like a good idea for a game, but i can't move because it only works for controller."
It gets boring after a while but I guess u can play long if ur trying to beat the record or something idk
"I cant change the control to the screen, it just have controller option, please fix this"
I want to play the game but i am playing it on my laptop and i cant control which way i run because there arnt controls for a laptop just tablet and phone controls pls fix
scam it says its 114 mb when I install it it says now 641 mb and the game is lag you pick up the items then Theres always so many zombies when I got 1580 meters
It doesn't have enough info and does not have enough control over the shooter
"I m unable to use touch screen control setting, do something i want to play bt unable to do"
"I would rate this game five stars, but the new update ruined the controls. Now the game is completely unplayable for me. I prefer the crosshairs and d-pad, as well as having crouching and sprinting be used through different ways of tapping the screen. I can't play at all with the new controls, and I refuse to after simply looking at them. The old controls were nice, simple, and straightforward. There was no need to change it. I might uninstall the game if it's not fixed."
"For some reason, it doesn't let me upload my own skins. Every time i try to use the image, it says, ""That's not a minecraft skin silly,"" when i've used that same image and skin multiple times. I would also like to add that the new moving settings messed me up really badly. I used to be able to play with the pc version inventory, and i had a d-pad AND a crosshair, and now i have to choose between the d-pad or the crosshair when all i want is both. Im appalled Minecraft."
"Re-downloaded the game to play with friends and found that the controls have changed. Either you have a joystick with the crosshair with separate action buttons or D-pad/joystick with no crosshairs and no buttons. Can't we just have the option to customize our controls? I liked using the D-pad with the crosshairs and no weird buttons, so it's really hard to stretch your fingers to play when using the buttons for separate actions."
"The continuous updates are infuriating. I can't play with my kids every time there's a tiny bug fix. Either make new versions backward compatible for multi-player, or slow down the pace of updates. Like, 1 a year would be fine. (yeah right...like any software company in the world has the perspective to do anything other than push for constant updates, and think that indicates success...)"
"It was pretty good the first couple of uses, but after a day or two the game broke and I couldn't access the marketplace, skins, or online features. I've checked multiple times to make sure nothing was wrong, and at this point I'm hoping uninstalling and reinstalling fixes it, because I really don't want to have dropped 8ish dollars on something that barely functions. Edit: it did not. It is still broken"
"It's fine. If you have no way to play Java edition, or have friends who can't play Java edition (such as people stuck on switch or Xbox, or you don't have a good pc), then this does the job just fine. If you can play Java, play that instead. Bedrock is full of bugs that range from annoying to game breaking, and comparatively, bedrock just feels janky and feels like a rushed game that doesn't run well, despite it being made for mobile. If you can play Java, bedrock is not worth your time."
"Yes, it's a really good game. Why am I giving it 2 stars? Cuz I can't download it anymore. I uninstalled it one time and tried to re-download and it takes an hour to download and when it's done it says a problem has occurred. Ive tried restarting my phone, clearing cache from all my apps, nothing is working. Not even Youtube! It's been on for a year now and I'm still struggling, and when my sister did the same and reinstalled, it works for her but not for me! Please fix this or give me advice!"
"I love this game but the new update is awful. It glitches, won't let you toss out an item unless you make a chest to put it in. Will make the maximum amount of an object instead of one or two. Using a furnace is much harder for no reason, and you have to hold an item twice as long to split it into multiple. It makes it really hard to enjoy playing. It was so much better before the last update."
"I absolutely love this game and I've been hooked for years. But for the last 4 months, it's been crashing uncontrollably. It crashes almost every time it tries to sign into my xbox live, and now when I'm playing multiplayer; the whole screen will spontaneously turn black and freeze my entire phone. I payed 7 dollars for this game and I am NOT getting my moneys worth. I didnt pay for a game that constantly lags down, freezes, crashes, and glitches. I want a refund for this if this doesnt stop."
"Fun, but a couple of glitches; Galaxy S8. Had to turn off auto jump because when walking alongside a wall your character keeps hopping, as if attempting to jump over a block. Also sometimes while in water, you get stuck and can't jump out of the water and onto land; you just hop in place. Lately I've had to launch the app two or more times to get it to start, because it sometimes crashes when trying to load the game. I've probably dropped close to $100 at this point on Minecraft DLC. Please fix."
"The game is amazing... when it works. This isnt so much of an issue on phone but on every other version the game is stable 90% of 20% of the time. They made multiplayer horrible difficult to get into, even if it's a LAN game you still need to be connected to the internet. Also when configuring settings for online it says you need to change your microsoft account settings. When you go to change these you realize that they are already correct and you have to click accept again. Its UNNECESSARY."
"It was fun while it lasted, Now everytime I open the app it crashes. I don't know if its my phone or the app itself. Tried different methods like reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, turning down my graphics settings, etc. But nothing seems to work. When I reinstalled it I was only able to play it once before it started crashing again (None of my worlds where there so that was a waste of time and money). I feel like this app needs a bit of a fixer upper."
"The game itself is obviously well designed, but as a port it is really showing it's age. The control options are SEVERELY limited which makes downright unplayable for someone like me who has been playing first person mobile games for years. Claw grip is not possible, and you can't move buttons around at all; and the default position is shoved into the corners of the screen. Great game, needs an update."
"Of course, minecraft is all the fun it claims to be. A great game overall. I am unhappy with the constant crashes I experience though. I am on a Galaxy S9 with plenty of storage, yet the app will shut down on startup and crashes during gameplay. I'm not even in a realm or with friends, just in a little survival world of my own. Again, nothing about the gameplay is bad, but it seems as though there are some bugs that need to be worked out. Will give more stars if the problem is resolved."
"Needs true mouse support. This is a port of a PC game. There is also a settings tab for Keyboard and Mouse, yet mouse isn't actually supported. Doesn't make sense. I don't want to click and drag to turn my camera. Touch controls... work, I guess. However, I've broken too many blocks on accident due to mining being tied to the same action as looking. Combat is also terrible with touch controls."
"I was enjoying the game, played it during long road trips with friends extremely smooth. Then after a month, the game received new updates and all of a sudden ruined my entire playing experience. I can play a world for about 20 seconds before it crashes, and I am unable to join friends world's. I also receive several errors about my Microsoft account failing to connect, and the market place being disabled due to errors. After re downloading the game several times, it seems to get worse everytime"
"Please don't make the mistake I did thinking this will work with your Xbox or PC Minecraft. The worlds are saved locally and not attached to your Live account, so you can't pick up where you leave off. I completely regret trusting the 4.6 stars and buying this without doing my homework. Also, the controls are atrocious. Every mobile game I've ever played has move on the left, look on the right. Here, you look by dragging anywhere on the screen, and move by pressing virtual buttons. Unintuitive"
"Is minecraft good? Yes in every way. The mobile version is exactly what it should be and is almost flawless. But the mobile version is by far the most neglected regardless of it having the BIGGEST playerbase compared to other platforms. There are plenty of bugs, performance issues, and other things dealing with the same issues to find here. The game is functioning fine, but for the time and budget the game has access to, I feel like it lacks refinement over here."
"So, I love Minecraft. But with the most recent update, it's become super glitchy. Especially in realms. And it's not just my internet, it happens wherever I'm at, even if the connection is good. I'll save and quit in a safe spot, get back on later, and I'm dead and have lost all my stuff. It's happened on multiple occasions. And it constantly kicks me from the game. There are times when I die randomly, lose my stuff, go back to it (less than 5 min) and it's all gone. Lots of bugs. Fix it please"
"the game is fun but it has many bugs. there is a lack of support for controllers and keyboards/mice even though theyve been advertising for years. playing with friends on private servers has become a corporate mess. you either pay for a realm, a third party to host a server, or you have to learn to port forward your router to allow your friends to connect directly."
"The controls are difficult to deal with, especially while building. I don't want to delete and place things with the same motion, there should be two separate buttons. Also, linking my Xbox controller has bugs as well. My character spins around and doesn't do what I want it to do. These things get fixed and I'll give a higher rating."
"i love the game so much. i paid money for it. it keeps breaking. if i redownload and make a new account, i can play, but as soon as i get back in the app, the screen goes black, and the app boots me. ive tried everything. it stopped for awhile, and then, as i had an amazing couple worlds, BOOM. GONE. everything. all my hard work and i cant even restart because i can't get into the app more than once. unacceptable."
"Minecraft has always been a very fun game for me. I've always enjoyed playing it for long hours and with many of my friends. But Minecraft Pocket Edition has always had a huge amount of problems with it. Frankly, the fact that I spent over 20 hours in a world that I had been building for months that wasn't able to be accessed, because the app wouldn't even open. I finally uninstalled the app and reinstalled it after refused to even open, and found each and every one of the files for my worlds deleted. I wanted to return to world I hadn't worked on in months, only to find that it was no longer there. I wish I could get it back but I didn't have any sort of backup. Thanks Minecraft"
"You're better off playing Xbox 360 edition or Java edition. The user interface is a headache to navigate, every button turns into a puke green color when interacted with, performance has dropped hard since 2016, combat feels affluent and mushy, load times have also lengthened since 2016, the game has the store plastered everywhere you go, and none of your progress syncs properly or at all between devices."
"Everything about this game is good except for the controls. They fact that you can't customize them at all, and that they're just so unwieldy to use gives you a huge disadvantage when your playing on servers. Because of how shooting mechanics work, I often find myself unintentionally shooting my crossbow while turning. Also, after playing for awhile, the controls get janky and I have to exit my world to fix it. Switching between items while moving is hard, and the game sometimes doesnt respond."
"I loved playing Minecraft. I used to play it all the time. But lately, I've encountered a plethora of problems, mainly when trying to join a world. I repeatedly get the ""unable to connect to world"" message when trying to join a friend's world. While Minecraft works on almost everything else in my house, I keep getting error code: Cauldron on my phone. I've done everything to fix any problems it may encounter, deleted and reinstalled, connected to different internet, you name it. Nothing works."
"I love minecraft and it seems like they are trying to get PE as close to PC as possible. They have done an awesome job except for keyboard inputs. First off button remapping does NOT work at all. You can click it but it won't change a thing. Second when you toggle ""full keyboard"" the number pad does NOT work, when trying to look around. By doing some researching online it seems like this has been a problem for a while now with no resolve. Please fix this!! Easily 5 ⭐'s if fixed!"
"It's a great game, but after the update it has become a bit less fun. For example, when I play multiplayer skins often change to my friend's skin or a random skin. Also my game crashes a few time before I can get on the world. I would give it a five star if these things did not happen."
"I love Minecraft. I play it all the time. It's one of my favourite games. But there are some very big problems mojang needs to fix. First, the touch controls are very very annoying. I just hate them. Second, it won't let me sign into my Microsoft account! I tap it and an error message comes up. And last but hecka not least... It wont let me create a world. Why. I can't play Minecraft if I can't make a world. Those are the only things tho. I love this game and totally recommend it. Thank you!!!"
I've been having trouble with a glitch where the point where I tap changes higher and higher at random. It gets to be impossible to access my hotbar or inventory because the buttons are all on the bottom the the screen. It sometimes get to the point where you need to click a whole block below the block you want to break. Ps4 Controllers seemingly don't work on this version of either my phone or just the app. It ruins the whole game.
"The game is fun but there is a major problem about multiplayer. Me and my friend have an xbox account and we are both signed in perfectly fine. But recently when we tried to join or invite each other, it was super buggy and it wasn't working at all. When we tried to go onto friends it said sorry try again later the whole time. Also we tried to invite each other but we couldn't see our names and profile. Sometimes it even said no friends have been added. Multiplayer needs to be fixed, it's buggy."
"Ok, so if you can actually load the game, it's good. I spent most of the time on ""loading"" But if I try to join any server, it's only a 50/50 chance that you can get in. If you do, then said sever will always glitch. No matter what it is. Then there's about a 25% chance that you will be able to properly and use it. Yes, I've tried restarting, uninstalling, checking wifi, checking data, clearing cache, even going so far as deleting pictures and other apps from my device to make it run smoother."
"Fix the skins, they don't function correctly when you're playing with other people, they either don't show up, or you suddenly have your friends skin on, it's even more annoyimg on servers. Also the character creator is dreadful, there is no reason to pay more than the Pocket Edition is worth, for an arm or a leg. Add something to make these unlockable, instead of paying being the only option, I suggest through achievements."
"The game is great and all, but it sucks whenever I'm trying to play on a realm with my friends. I have to keep on exiting out and opening the app because it says that I can't play online, and I have to change a setting. I've checked my Microsoft account a billion times, and I always have the setting allowed. This is a serious bug that should be fixed."
"Ive always loved Minecraft, but as soon as downloading it on my Android, it just kept crashing. I tried reopening the app multiple times, but every time i do, all my data is lost, and it tells me to sign in to my Microsoft account, again and again. It won't even let me make new worlds. And when i press buttons, the whole game freezes and crashes."
"I would rate a 5, but on here I can't play the game at it's full potential. It constantly says ""Low memory,"" whenever I get on to play. I even turned off: beautiful skies, smooth lighting, and fancy graphics. This shouldn't be an issue, especially while playing on a Samsung Galaxy S9+. Will rate a 5 once this gets fixed somehow!"
"This app is okay but not worth it for its price. I have an Xbox account and sometimes I'll play servers and if if I hit blocks the game pad will disappear along with the jump button, pause button, and chat button. I also hate the fact that u need an Xbox live account in order to have a larger variety of games and friends to play with. Though it's free it's a long long process to do."
"First of all I do think its okay but it is super laggy. It crashes constaly , even if theres nothing wrong with your wifi. When you send invites to friends it doesnt always work. the concept is good the graphics could be better, so could the lag. Game controls aremt the best i constanly squad when i didnt even touch the control. They also had it on chrome but they took that away, which is sad thats what i played on for years now i have to learn on tablet. I will change my ratings if its adressed"
"this app has been really good in the the past, but in this update, it's terribly buggy, black screens when going underwater, freezes at the start screen, copious lag, and freezes when loading in custom resources. once these bugs are taken care of, my rating will definitely increase."
"I love the game Minecraft, but it doesn't seem to translate well to mobile, which is sad that I wasted my money :( The controls are wonky, I try to swim out of the water but just sink lower, combat is hard because you cant as easily tap jump, run and attack all at the same time. I suppose I must just be the odd one out, since all the other reviews are great :("
"I loved everything about minecraft, just as I have for many years. However, in recent months, I havent been able to even LOG IN. PLEASE fix this! It sends me right back to the home screen instead of a login screen, like a loop. I can't join servers, access my old worlds, or play with anyone else. If this bug was fixed, however, I would happily give minecraft an A++++!"
"To start, I do enjoy Minecraft, unfortunately however, the mobile version isn't that good of a port. The store on the home screen is very buggy and doesn't work half of the time (I spent $6 on one of the bundles and didn't det anything included in it). The movement controls being a stationary d-pad hurt the playability and are especially egregious when most other 3d games on mobile use a circle pad. And then there's the visual glitches, this happening despite there apparently being bug patches."
"I refunded this. First of all, Minecraft is an amazing game. So it gets 2 stars for that. BUT, the controls are horrible. Touch controls feel janky, I can't really move and do the things I want to do comfortably. I saw it had controller support, so I thought ""problem solved"". But when I tried using my new xbox one controller, my character would spin wildly, and 75% of the time the game refused to take my inputs. I'd press buttons and move the analog sticks, and nothing would happen. What a joke."
"I don't know what happened, but I just went to play and suddenly it says EVERYTHING I have bought in the marketplace was never purchased. I have worlds using certain texture packs that I paid for with money, that are locked because ""this world utilizes resources you have not purchased"". I am NOT going to buy ALL of the things I've bought over the past year all over again! In my settings in storage, it shows all the resource packs, but they're shown as locked. It was normal a few hours ago! Help!"
"My Minecraft keeps crashing after deleting old worlds, I don't know if it's because I have add-ons but I've tried clearing my cache and data. I also can't join my friend's world and vice versa anymore unless I have a Microsoft account. Before many updates, it would work if the players were beside each other. It gives me a lot of hard times because sometimes it would work and sometimes not. Please fix this!"
"as much as i loved the java edition, this version of the game was a but difficult to control at times. I'm not a huge fan of the store either. There are things on the store that should be free if not removed completely. why are people selling their burned down houses for 5 or more dollars. In this edition's defence it has really good multiplayer. Too bad it itsn't compatible with java, even though its completely comatible with all other modern versions of the game."
"Okay, I'm no game designer, and I'm not entirely sure how long it takes to make new content in the game, but it takes way too long for each update to come out, LIKE COME ON it doesn't have to be a big update Everytime!!! There could be cool small things here and there, like for example new enchantments? Perhaps new mobs every once in a while? Or perhaps a new type or block to make a certain aspect of something cooler. If you want a functional game you need to keep it fresh please fix this :/"
"The game used to be great until it began crashing at random during startup and gameplay. There's no way for me to fix this and I'd rather not risk progress I made in worlds. I am logged into a Microsoft account but I doubt it has to do with that since once the game finally decides to load it tells me, ""Global Resources Reset."" I don't know how to fix this because I can barely experiment with the settings. Game-killing bug."
"I've been playing since 2014. Lately I've been experiencing several bugs. One being, I have my friends added on our accounts. But when we try to play together it shows ""no friends are playing"". Another bug is, realms is not working and also I'm logged in to my Microsoft account but when I go to play pvp, it says it won't validate my login. Lastly when I save skins and leave and reopen the app, none of my saves skins are there. It's a 3 until they fix it."
"It's a good game for the most part, But theres a bug that's making it difficult: When I try to load up the game, it always crashes when loading for no reason, So I have to re-install it, Login, and do whatever I wanna do, But then when I close the app and open it up again later, it crashes again, so I have to repeat the process everytime I wanna play the game, Its annoying as heck. Please fix this bug and maybe I'll give it 4 or 5 stars"
I like Minecraft but there are three problems. One the controls are horrible I can't even move cause like how d pad shape looks and I more use to a joy stick then a d pad. Two the game keeps lagging and crashing so if I wanted to get snack and phone turn off so I turn back on and it just kicks me out. I dont why it has to do this but or something wrong with my phone. Three u can't play mini games or multiplayer with u with Microsoft account and that kinda sucks and I hope mojangs works on this.
The game is good in every way but there's one major problem. The lag. The lag absolutely ruins everything. It takes forever to load up a world. Chunks don't load when you want them to. Stuff doesn't respond like hitting an enemy. And I can barely play on multiplayer servers because of it. So Mojang if you are reading this please fix the lag
"Extremely fun and creative game, but the multiplayer aspect was not working for me. I have good internet and an xbox account, but it would not let me play multiplayer as it would glitch and lag and eventually kick me out of the game. Please fix this bug because it was extremely fun and easy to player multiplayer back before some of the newer updates."
"This game was great for a while until the latest update. Now, the game closes and sends me straight to the home screen at random intervals without warning. I never had this problem before, and I've already cleared the cache and removed and reinstalled the game with still the same results. The controls have also become unresponsive at times too making this game virtually unplayable. (Installed on Samsung Galaxy A13 4G)"
"I absolutely adored this game having grown up with it spending countless hours with friends or on my own... however this new engine for bedrock feels straining trying to play... on top of that commercialising on skins etc is pathetic. It hasn't been integrated well enough, there's too many issues (custom skins not loading because ""it's not a Minecraft skin"" it is). I would rather install the original pocket edition and be stuck in 2016 or whenever."
"2 stars not solely because of the game but also because of the Google Play store's 48-hour refund policy. I spent those 48 hours trying to troubleshoot my problem of me not being able to play with friends overseas. Once I made up my mind to get a refund it was already too late. Wish the refund policy was a 2 hours of game time or 5 day limit, whichever came first."
"I don't know what's happening over there with your lazy team but there are a ton of bugs for example: whenever I want to choose a skin from my gallery it just doesn't work anymore and everytime I try to use one of my skins from my gallery it will say ""that's not a skin silly"" Like what?? Next bug is that whenever I failed to press the button where your could use your own skins and you accidentally press it, the screen will have a grey visual effect that makes it so that you can't press anything"
"I had it for about 2 days and then when I tried playing today on the Hive, the packs wouldnt load and it was just not working. So, I uninstalled the app and went to reinstall it when it won't let me. I tried installing other apps, they worked. Its just Minecraft. I have it bought, I have enough space."
"New 1.19.70 update makes the game unplayable. The new inventory movement mechanics show all the item information both while you're hovering over something AND when you move it, so if you have enchanted items you can't even see into your inventory. Item movement is also temperamental as you get stuck in a slot and can't move anything else. Please revert back to the old inventory controls!"
"I regret paying for this game. I think it sucks and is very overrated. Played it the past few days and did not enjoy any part of it. Wish there was a free trial so I wouldn't have had to waste my money on something I'm never going to play. The only reason it gets 2 stars from me is because the app performed well and only crashed once, otherwise I would have given just 1 star."
"I'm a life long Minecraft Veteran. I've played the game since it came out and I love it dearly. But, bc of the recent update, the game is unplayable. I can't click into any menu or move any item unless I double click it or some weird click meathed. It's infuriating and annoying. I need this to be fixed so I can play."
"Don't get it wrong I love this game. But ever since the new update came I haven't been able to join any of my friends when ever I tried to join it always say ""Unable to connect, Please restart client"" I don't know what that is I try finding it in setting but nothing I hope it gets fixed soon so I could join my friends in their world again. My wifi,data and their wifi and data fine nothing seems to have problem at all. I hope it could be fix."
"For whatever reason, I'm simply unable to join my realm on mobile. Whenever I try to join, I immediately get the message ""unable to connect to your network, try checking your connection"" without any delay at all, as if it's not even trying to connect to the realm. My internet connection is just fine and works for all my other apps, so I'm at a loss as to what the issue is."
"I miss the 360 era minecraft before update aquatic. The old soundtrack was better game felt good and just perfect textured the new ores, music, block texture updates and everything is just bad and flat out just makes me feel weird as a whole. I now get bored of it and feel empty but when I olay the older versions I feel more satisfyed and don't get as bored. I miss spending hours on creative building worlds with friends on xbox360 everyday after school. Bring back how the 360 feeling was plz😒😔"
"I've been playing minecraft ever since it was introduced to me, and seeing the update, which sucks because I like the old version better, where there's not hassle in controlling these joysticks and it gets confusing at times... It is in fact new, but I hate the fact that it gets more confusing... two stars for me. ;^;"
It sucks when switching log in accounts. You can't edit your character if you're offline! There's no real pause button! Plus it always logs one out when switching to other apps(SOMETIMES if you don't take too long to switch back). The game itself is good I guess.
"I gave it 2/5 star rating. The textures of seaweed and stuff on water is fixed. The following reasons are: • I lost a bee when I mined a hive that contained 2 bees with Silk Touch. Greatly disappointed considering Bees are special. • There are a tons of bugs, especially entities at a far distance move abruptly and weird, causing any lead attached to them break. • Furnaces and crafting table slots can be buggy. I often cannot select other items unless I reopen the furnace or crafting menu."
"This was a lovely game one of the best games I've ever had. It was such a relaxing and enjoyable experience which I loved just builds thing and trying to start a city. BUT, since the latest update came around all my worlds that I spent hundreds of hours on just got deleted and there no way to get them back. That is so poorly of the game developers to let that happen that I just couldn't rate this game any higher."
This isn't a very good game The controls are very weird and I play bedrock every day but not mobile I feel like Minecraft mobile is holding back bedrock edition to add more features. it should break off into a separate version bedrock doesn't even have the combat update and it would be very weird to play on mobile dual wielding. Java edition has way more accessibility it has way more things to do than bedrock. Please Make it a different version to make more features like the combat update.
"It keeps crashing. At first it just crashes 1-3 times so it doesn't bother me but now the game crashes everytime I press ""Play"". I've lowered the graphics, close the tabs, and cleared the storage and yet IT STEAL CRASHES. Mojang pls fix this as soon as possible"
"Minecraft launcher versions. - Firstly, I suggest the game company should add minecraft launcher versions for mobile users and java users, if there aren't any. - Secondly, Because of the updating version issue, I can't play online with my friends or be on servers that are lower than 1.19.X, let's say for example, I'm joining a server that is on 1.19.3 and my app's version is 1.19.4 and up, there should be a way to change the version of the app."
"There's seems to be a glitch because i haven't played in while and i joined a friends world and it started to blink like it's turn pitch black then on while in game eventually it got faster and if i had sensitivity to flashing lights i would be in world of pain right there bc i uninstalled, restarted my phone and it keeps doing so yeah either fix it or fix it ( i still like the game Minecraft rocks but this makes it difficult to play)."
"I know that developers don't care about PVP, but if they're going to let PC players play with touch players, the least expected is that touch players can move their buttons to feel more comfortable since their default controls they are very badly located (subjective) it is like not letting you change the keys to those of pc. Also, it's not normal for 3 Ghosts and 20 skeletons to spawn your face in the nether, I know it's due to optimization but I know they could improve it"
"Great game on console, but mobile sucks. It is like you have mcD WIFI and i miss playing tutorial mode i really liked the map! Can you (MOJANG STUDIOS) add it back? Please? I just got two games, not a big deal right? No. The first game, theres nothing to do! Like there is nothing fun! The second game, the book for tutorial wont go away! So those were rip offs! I want refunds! I wasted my minecoins on FAKES!"
When i bought a bunch of games/packs the update wouldn't let me play them. It is making me re pay for the packs when I spent around 100 dollars on it and I didn't get the money back which is really a good way to make people mad so if you download it don't pay a bunch of money on it. Other than that the joystick I weird and the rest is okay I guess.
"I don't understand what is happening with my game. I have an issue where it says ""This is not a Minecraft Skin, silly"" even though I know it's a minecraft skin. It always worked fine, yet I also have an issue where I can't download MODS or SKIN PACKS since the game doesn't want to open. I did all I could, no progress, and I DO have the game bought and it always worked. Please, do something to fix it if possible, because the game's unentertaining otherwise. I can't even play with a friend."
Edit again: all is well since I have to reset my duo due to a bug/glitch for anything to do with signing into my XB/MS acc. Idk why but now I'm unable to play using touchscreen and can't seem to enable touch control in setting. So now I'm stuck with controller option as default for some reason.
"The newest update removed my worlds. But I didn't have a cleaner app... I tried to recover my worlds, but I couldn't find the folder/file. Please help because I spent so much time on this game. I'm on android by the way. I will improve my review if this gets fixed and I will also reply to any responses. Update: I checked the minecraft bug website and they closed the ticket since ""it isn't a bug in the actual game."" So I have lost months worth of time due to an update I wasn't aware about."
"The 1.19.70 update kinda ruined the feeling of playing Minecraft. The change that makes the item stats show in 2 different places is very annoying and the little box that shows wherever you click in your inventory is annoying too, please fix this. Thank You"
"I absolutely love minecraft, but I just downloaded it the other day and every time I open the app, an AI voice goes over the names of every button and everything I click on. I have to double tap any button in order to open something, and it doesn't let me scroll on anything, like the inventory and the buttons in the settings. Can someone tell me how to please fix this?"
"I've been experiencing this issue every time I play Minecraft. I log in my account and make a new world, playing for hours then I decide to close the Minecraft and when I get back to the App is sign out again.. All my game play for that world is gone... All data has been deleted and all settings that I've set has turn back to default, everything turn to default and I need to sign in back again but can no longer recover my world.. It's like I regret buying the game.. Please help."
"I used to LOVE this game until the new update, please get rid of Render dragon!! I really want to have good graphics while playing the game. I was so sad when I couldn't use any of my past shaders anymore..just one thing, please AT LEAST add good quality/graphics to the game if you want to get rid of added shaders!"
"Over all this is a okay game. For a long time it would not let me play with friends online, and it got pretty boring. All there really is to do is build and go on survival mode. Also Minecraft would glitch up a lot, it would get to the point where you avatar would get out of your control and move by its self and delete parts of what ever I was bulding. On Minecraft near the play button they would say stuff in like yellow words, and the more I would get on Minecraft the more the yellow words."
Ok. I love Minecraft. And my first problem was that I couldn't pay for realms on time. No problem I'll just pay it when I get money right? I got charged double the amount of the realms and I lost all my money. So I thought: hey I'll just get it on mobile to play it there since I don't have it on my Xbox yet. I CANT EVEN SIGN INTO MY ACCOUNT and I lost 15 dollars which could have gone to gamepass but NO Mojang has to spend as much money as possible making a new Minecraft game that nobody wants.
I can no longer play the game. Every time I play it crashes at least once. Every time I try to turn my camera it violently shakes and I can't move until it crashes again.
I really really love this game but I can't really play it anny more. With the new controls I don't like them it's harder to kill mobs its complicated and I really want the old controls back please bring them back.
"Bad. I was trying to play with my friend, but it kept saying ""outdated server! "" or ""outdated client! "" can someone help me fix this? It's been going on for a year."
"Bedrock (this version) is treated drastically different compared to its Java PC counterpart. We suffer from horrific monopolization of add-on creator permissions, where every feature we create is ""patched"" and promptly locked behind a paywall. And while Microsoft does this, it simultaneously ignores the glitches we have to face daily that make the game barely playable. Less features, less quality, less freedom. Just get Java."
"i Dont know what is going on but whenever i try to install this perticular game, after it goes to 100 percent it say ""sorry cannot download trye again and if it doesn't work try these options down below""and I've tried them and it still doesn't work i have even gone to waiting WEEKS but its still not working, other games and apps download but this one doesn't please fix this as i payed for this game."
you have a bug that when you use keybaord the spacebar doesnt register and when i tested out of the game my spacebar always does work but when i get into the game the spacebar does work so that i am able to jump but if i open a chest or open my inventory or even at random times it just stops registering the spacebar so that i can jump so personally i think that if you can fix the jump button ill gladly give the game a 5 star until my game starts registering my jumps when i click the space barNO
New update makes everyone loose their world. In order to recover the I have to locate a folder I can't find. Don't know how they expect a population of mostly kids to go into the root of their device to get their world's back cause I sure can't figure it out. Don't know what they were thinking releasing an update like this.
Realms constantly breaks and I can't crouch under slabs. I can't use T and T duper's? I can't use any kind of duper's you remove. Our XP glitches and all sorts of other stuff. You won't even let us use RTX even though RTX compatibility is with xbox. 2nd tired of the wanting to update 2 versions bedrock and Java? Even. Though? It's completely unreasonable if you just combine both versions allow me to use RTX. I'm guaranteed to have more fun. I probably won't play minecraft anymore.
"Ok this was 10 seconds ago, and I went to go on to my world and it just disappeared, so I went to see it save onto my internal or external storage, NOPE GONE FOR GOOD. Get your stuff together, please. Not only that, my account likes to log out by it's self. I was going to have friend join my world soon, now I'm going to have to start over."
"It takes up too much space!! And they have updates all the darned time! Those updates don't fix anything, they just take up space on your phone Oh, and if you think you can install this game on a SD card, well, you can't. So good luck having any more than 10 apps on your phone, if you have minecraft"
"The game crashes everytime a different app opens. When I go back to the game, it is a black screen that forces the game to be closed and restarted."
I clicked my world and it said I have restricted Storage and that I need to clear my storage. This has started happening after the new update. I am really getting annoyed because I can't play Minecraft with my friends. What is going on with the game? Also why does it say I have an outdated Server when I updated the game?
"I love this game, I've been playing this since 2013. Now that I had the money to purchase the game and download it legally, it puts a smile on my face. The problem is that the game's file is deleting every few hours on my phone, the ""games"" folder doesn't even exist even if I'm in external storage mode. Please fix this, I don't want to regret paying for the game I used to play as a kid."
"When u try to sign in and ur email is wrong why can't u type it again, it doesn't work. And when u delete it it doesn't download. But is an interesting and incredible game"
Minecraft has went down the hill these past few years. Multiplayer isn't working. Can't download it on mobile no more. Fix these problems instead of trying to update once more and mess the game up even more.
"The new upgraded is disappointment for me and many people playing, so it would be nice if it was back to normal. Although the result is a 2 the rest of the game is FINE. Its not the best game nor the perfect, but i liked it before. Thank you."
"This game has potential, especially since it's still being updated. It has a lot of problems though. Setting are reset after you turn off the game, buildings and AI car graphics are comparable to 3ds graphics. There's no driver, which looks really weird especially in the side by side. The pics that you see on Google play are nowhere close to the real thing. You can fly and glitch through buildings by repeatedly pressing the flip button though. Just park under an overhang and try it!"
"Before the update it was good but now it looks like they tried to hard. It looks like a wanna be nock off of asphalt 8 or 9. Plus there are constant ads and every time you buy a car there is an ad for another real world money car. Also the sign in button didn't work for me. And one last thing, the controls there fine but there is no way to adjust them to fit your screen. Overall its a meh game wouldn't recommend."
"I don't think this game is great. Why? The controls are VERY sensitive, there's a lot of lazy challenges, and much more. For example, a bug, that they never fixed, is the one that you press the flip button repeatedly. It will make your car float for a while. Car customization is lame, too. Please improve this game more."
"overall its pretty fun to play. way to many ads. I don't like how the cars have an auto brake to them. the Physics aren't that realistic to an actual car, a normal car doesn't spin out that easy. I feel like you download this game just to watch these ads, and not for the game itself."
"There's nothing to do besides drive around a map aimlessly and be bombarded with ads. You pause the game, an ad. You go to the garage, an ad. You just got done Watching an ad? Great, because 20 seconds later you'll be prompted to watch another. Does that sound like fun to you? It gets 2 stars for the graphics and controls but that's about it. No races...no challenges...No game to be found here unfortunately."
This game is quite fun. but u get alot of ads and its very glitchy it doesnt really let me back up or anything i think they should upgrade this game there are so many problems this game is bad but it is realaxing to crash into cars and make an mess in the game i like to crash into things i think they should add some people to make it more fun it would be so cool even with blood so maybe upgrade it if u do so ill rate this and 5 star. not so good so for right now i rate this app 2 stars good day!
I give it a 2 because every 5-10 mins it has a comecial break and you can't go in the buildings and there is no people in the game to drive with or to talk with and you are not in the same game those are all my conplants but it has some good things about it but make the game better NOW almost everyone has a lot of conplants!!!!!!!!!!!!! JUST send us to all the open cars then making us do things to open the CARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Huge open world map and some fun to be had at the airport. But the controls are terrible and it's loaded with ads. If the controls were good I'd consider paying for an ad free version. The steering wheel is awful and has no actual variation. The tiniest movement gives you maximum left or maximum right. And no slider pedals either.
Understand the need for developers to display ads but too many is too many. Not a keeper. Nice gameplay for the time between ads.
"I cannot download high quality content and the skins of the cars my net is on then also it is giving to options retry or skip. 2 stars for good graphics, and one thing handling of steering is terrible, I deleted the game. Worst expirience.🤮"
"I am an old player of this game, last time I've played in 2018. After many years I've installed this game in 2023. The graphics are greatly improved very much but the handling of car makes it worst experience, Last time,I enjoyed stunt missions, collecting car tokens etc made this game great but handling issues like inverted steering option, sometime car accelerates automatically, steering sensitivity, lack of these basic options Now I stick to dr. driving 1"
"It's an ok game, it's just that they focus only on adding new cars and new car skins and stuff like that, that the graphics of stuff like the environment including buildings, roads, other cars are very bad quality, if you were to change this and work on the environment more and get them better graphics then I'll give 5 stars."
"compared to the 2014-2015 version of this game, the update is trash and horrible. Wish they never updated it, it's hard to steer, driving the cars have no control and it's frustrating. Bad game, bring back the older version"
Before the update the game was really good. But after a month as there was no update the became a little boring to play with the same cars and the same map. So today I downloaded the new update and it was a huge disappointment for me. There were new skins for the cars that I really liked but all of em were to be paid with real money. Bruh like seriously??
"It is good structure high graphics for all fellow, gamers but there is no competition vs other drivers just self stunts it is better if it is a race and stunts are for race obstacle that is insert in the race ,to pass the race. Is it not a race."
"I thought it would be like beamng with realistic crashes, all it is is a a game where you drive around fast."
Kind of okay. I played this game in my childhood and it was way better then. I think they are trying a little too hard on the graphics and stuff. Some cars need to be unlocked by doing tasks but the map is so big that you dont know where they are.
This is was nice car simulator game until they made megaskins real life money and online the missions are small and too simple and the city is too small. The best thing to do for this game is to add new missions and for all things in the game except for the game currency to be sold in game cash
Where is the tire side camera view? I can't change to that camera after the new update. What happened to that camera?
"Graphics are good all well, but the thing I'm disappointed with is the gyro. Very high sensitivity, absolutely no stabilization. Please improve the game."
Defarenc car or defarenc intanar . This city too short. I hop next update you provide big city . But this game is very interesting. Thank you Extreme car grup
"Half of the screen is covered with ads. Its really hard to click on the controls, most of the time you end up clicking on ad instead."
"Good game to play when you're bored, but there are too many ads. Every time you go to the airport, there's an ad."
"Such a good game. But only airport,city and off road. And all cars interior are same what the he'll. And some places are not developed properly. And this game need people in cars and walking in road side."
Game is very good but wheel is so small and I request you to change a size of wheel. Immediately
Game is good but couldn't download high quality always says couldn't connect to network even i have 5g network then also 😮‍💨
"I disagree with the game, it said I need ad breaks, I said I don't. I know ads equal more money, but they shouldn't interrupt game play. Also, the controls need work. Well, bye.🖑"
ok. I know this is a pretty fun game to play. but this game is super unrealistic. other cars driving through each other. being able to glitch into buildings. and even worse. the reset button sends you flying! I know it's just a game but the fact that it's a simulator! these are ment to be realistic. and not to mention the ads. ads ads ads ads and why not. MORE ADS. but other than those reasons tho. I kind of enjoyed this game. but unless you want a lag fest ad virus on your phone. I don't reccome
Way too Many ads for the first two minutes
"Weak exhaust sound, annoying music and menu, ads interrupt play and NO MANUAL?"
In this update when I drive my cars and repairing my cars it's not repairing😡😡.
loved it but really glitchy and soooo many ads everysecond 3/10
"Good idea but an add every minute plus if you try to interact with anything is unbearable. The amount of times I've been working at something, then an add comes on and after you can't even interact for a second is shocking. AT LEAST pause the game so you can have control after. I know all games these days have lots of adds, but this is add heaven. Don't usually like to complain but I have to say, it feels like you can just play a bit of a game while you wait for the add."
I like the game but there's just too much ad's every one to three minutes. But sometimes it's fun. And I think that I like the older version cause in my opinion I like the older version of the game.
You made a big mistake of removing the lambo and I do not like how only on my new tablet have has the old update have over sing at that so what was the app called again oh Panda helper please add that to Panda helper Library annoying it's also very very very very very very annoying I tried up itself the Republic money money cost for some of this Mega skins
"I rate 2 stars because 1:whenever I want to pause this, an ad pops up 2: the purchase was not mentioned in the game 3 (the only last one) please make an update for playing in multiplayer"
The map need a huge update pls also add weather and make the map bigger and colourfull cars are ok but the map sucks the map needs a huge update also make gameplay style like nfsu add a story too pls add them also change the game logo because the game logo sucks .
I like the new graphics but I'm having an problem when back out and I open the app again it's all resets but my coins and my km are still saved but my cars and skins are all reset I even signed in but still resets
Please give multiple player mode plz and your game is too good keep it up
"Not gonna lie dude, the update Kind of ruined the game, the new soundtrack, ADS!!! Ads is the worst things, every minute I need to have an ad, the game used to be WiFi free but now it's not. This was my favourite game as a Kid, now it's just kinda meh, I still gave it two starts because of the graphics update, pretty cool!"
App is poor in features Seeing the fact that the before versions were the most best
"The game is fun, but your greed shows through."
"There are far, FAR too many ads in a game this simple. while the driving is fun enough to forgive the lack of variety in engine notes and other aesthetics, the amount of pop-up ads is just rediculous. also, there should be an option to use another car instead of the lambo for the various challenges"
"Poor AI's the other cars don't stop they just bump into you. The gameplay needs to be calibrated for a real car driving experience, such as steady acceleration, gear shifts, calibrated turns, use of turn signals, sanctions when you break driving laws such as running a red light, crashing the car etc. Also the option of having either manual or automatic transmission would be nice. A car simulator should simulate a real life vehicle."
"This could be one of the most amazing car games on this platform, but the only reason that people hate it is the ads. Everytime you do something like: Entering menu, entering a challenge, entering the garage, Theres an ad shows up. Which is really annoying for ads hater because they just want to race around the town without something interrupting them"
"Overall pretty boring! Overloaded with ads. The whole time you play a quarter of your screen is just a massive ad, with pop up ads every few minutes. Driving physics are decent for a mobile game but nothing special. World is a pretty good size but gets boring quickly after 5 to 10 minutes of exploring. Overall not much content and way to many ads. Not a 1 star but definitely not a 5!"
"This game needs alot of work. There needs to be more cars, more maps such as the beach, shopping mall, and an arctic area with snowy buildings and icicles. There also needs to be better crash physics. I want to see doors falling off, trunks opening, tires being teared off and you can drive with only the metal wheel scraping the road. And the wheels and tires are able to detach. You also need a character to customize, get out of your car and walk around. You will get 5🏅 from a lot more people."
Needs some upgrades like some more vehicles and there needs to be a different interior in each and every car all of interiors are the same and can you make smoke come out of the silencer please Then i will give this game 5 stars
"This game was amazing even a year ago and it haddent changed for years, it was perfect, but now i downloaded it today and i got spammed with add you couldnt select anything from the start you had to play the game for hours, you used to be able to just play solo or traffic for free, There was barely any adds only when you left driving. Yes there was some micro-transactions but you never needed to buy them, you could unlock most cars with fun When your actually driving you get spammed with ads smh"
"It's a nice game,I liked it the first time I played it but I guess they made some changes.... Ads appearing every minute,I deleted the app cos it was so annoying,you should work on that please."
"Good game but, there's a issue if you Uninstall it and install it again like in 5 seconds you start all over again."
Nice game but I think it should have better missions and opponents to race against so it can be less boring.
"This would be a really great game if there weren't so many ads. They pop up sometimes and I accidentally click them then my phone gets slow and I have to close the internet, app store, whatever app the ad opened up. It's really annoying but other than that I like the game."
1 minutely once commercial breaks I dont like this
"The game cool I love the cars but I don't like how the creators put the blue prints for the cars in areas that are near impossible to reach. I would give the game five stars when they change some of the locations of the blue prints. But otherwise, this game is awesome."
"Has potential. Controls are slightly crude. You drive around and collect ""tokens"" to unlock new vehicles but some tokens are placed atop of steep hills with narrow roads that are not flat. Many come to a point so your vehicle slides off the sides. Very annoying."
"I mean its a good game but the reason why I gave it 2 stares I can't use my keys or my mouse it's not broken, every time I click the screen the car gets out of control, even though i'm not controlling it its still turning and moving like a ghost is controlling it. It's a little glichy and I don't understand why it is doing that. It also make my computer not work."
"This game was once a fun game. Now it is not. After the ""Super Summer Update,"" every bug and glitch that made the game fun was patched, and my progress was erased! It made this once enjoyable little game that I could screw around with for a bit just become boring. I would have recommended it, but not now."
"This game is really good. Except for one thing. WAY TO MANY ADS! There is legit a timer. That timer is for when an ad should show up. When it says Ad in 3..2..1.., its just annoying! Also, everything you open the pause menu, you guessed it, it shows an ad! For real dude! This game is good it just needs less ads. Definitely not worth installing."
"I loved this game back in something like 2016 when it was much better handling. Now you're either sliding around or not turning at all. The graphics are better now, but everything seems so much worse. I wish I could rate this higher but alas. If you're willing to trudge through it then you may find a good game here, but I would suggest something else to satiate your desire."
"The gameplay is alright but the ads are absolutely insane. There aren't just ads whenever you pause; but there are also ads that interupt gameplay. I've gotten 2 ads in 1 minute while playing. They're video ads that you have to watch for at least 10 seconds to skip, too. They're incredibly annoying and ruined the game for me."
"Too many ads make the game annoying. Some advertisements are even placed improperly. Though there are different cars, all of them drive the same way. Gets boring quite easily. Not impressive, however the graphics are quite fine and the controls too. But in the end, the ads ruin the fun."
"i installed this for the fun memories i had, but there was an update or 2 when i didnt play it and now i dont even recognize it. i miss it when the graphics wheren't the best because there wasn't so many adds. this is just so- complicated now."
"When I was younger I'd play the game all the time, however, the updates seem to be a little unnecessary. The game was perfectly fine before and I don't see anything wrong with the old version. The new menu seems to be a bit more difficult to understand and the cars are laggy (I've check and there's nothing wrong with my phone.) And personally I find it odd how you can't change the way you drive anymore either."
The previous version of game was just amazing. New update has a lot better graphics but the new one is completely terrible coz the game has lost the feel of car driving. You can't now turn quite easily. Also the game has lost most of my favourite cars. New cars are cool though but driving mechanism is just awful. Please fix it and make it as the previous one. Edit: dropped one more star coz no response from developers.
"Why 2 stars? It is enjoyable, but the high end cars are a bit too fast, which makes driving them less enjoyable, also, good drift physics and realistic car sounds should be added. Costumization has improved but all that was added was rims selection, stance and different tuning set ups are heavily needed."
Not much ways to have fun in this game. There are though missions u can complete but it's so hard to find them because they're like hidden in places you'll have to wander forever to find them. And some coins collections are kinda very difficult. The thing in the end is it doesn't provide a very good experience instead has just a lot of wandering to do.
The game is good because it have many challenges . I want to complain about bug in this game is so annoying. But the game is still good . I just want to clear the bug . My phone has no problem with this game. And the graphic is awesome but the other car like no effect when we crash it .
"This game has so much ads that you can't even imagine. The game is also insanely laggy, it bugs you a lot especially if your doing challenges. The map is too small for a fast car. Very unrealistic damage and you can barely destroy anything in here. The new version of this game stinks!👎😡"
"This isn't really good. This isn't a simulator, not even going to call it simcade even. Every, single, cockpit is the exact same, too many ads, unreal damages, and even when you completed the game (unlocking every car, including the Veyron and the Koenigsegg) it doesn't serve any purpose left other than driving around. Not the best, i can certainly call it, but the reason i gave it two stars is because in despite of barely any content, the first minutes is quite enjoyable. But then its boring. 2"
I like it alot i just stopped playing because it got boring why here are the problems: Q 1.the map is very small It would be better of the map is bigger right 2.low graphics Can u make a graphics that is better and also can u make it smooth 3.hard challenges Can u make a challenge for a car that is easy cause it is to hard to get challenge cars. That's all I hope you find this game and make it better (BTW no Offence u might get offended)
"I've downloaded this game before and it was really great, I loved it. But now there is ad after ad after ad, there are no breaks. And speaking of which, the breaks and steering are very touchy. You lean the tiniest bit to the ride and all of a sudden you've turned around."
"Deletes your cars, too many ads. Really liked this one, but they released an update on the game that changed the cars. I spent a lot of time in the game to unlock the 64' mustang. Now after an update, the mustang is gone and was replaced by something that appears to have the rear end of a Camaro... Lame"
"This game is super cool but after unlocking all car what to do and its also boring. And the interior is same in all cars. Can you add some new big map in game or online,muntiplayer mode for playing. The old cars which us want to drive a lot. Some hard offroad place for offroading. This much is better for us in playing."
"This is a pretty good game, except that there is just too much ads, not enough ways to get coins, not enough maps and i would recommend putting a rainforest, dessert and snow taundra maps would be really good and i would really like if you add an online version where you could play with friends it would be realygood and i would like if you add a street race, race, police chasing you and stuff like that would really help. Hope you listen to me and upgrade this game as soon as possible,please do."
"It is very disappointing that instead of caring for its users its owners care for money. In a short period of time, this app has become one of the most annoying apps on my phone. And i blame the adds for this. The adds that promote the new app none other than ""snackvideo"". These adds give me a headache by appearing 5 times in 15 minutes and every time i press the pause button. The situation is further worsened when play store opens even though i press the cross button on these adds."
So this game is more of looking for things and just finding spots to just do some challenges which are literally just to give point A to point B the only thing I dislike about this game is watching ad every minute if you can go past the air and just doing some tricky challenging car game this is it this has nothing to do with racing except beating a Time
"I used to love this game but since the default car changed from the og lamborghini( my favourite car brand) I slowly started to hate it...I've played for 4 years now on different devices and the game play is the same throughout(just the graphics quality changed for some). It has an ok physics with crashing and stuff and is fun to play and drive around but it really needs multilayer(like desperately)....I hope these get re-added/added, then I'll be rating again with a higher star score...probably"
This game is trash now. I used to play this game. now i hate it because of the ads. The ads ruin the experince more than last time I still think this is garbage on the appstore but AT least i give the graphics a 5 out of 10 because the car model just deforms no parta fall off. PLEASE FIX ALL OF THESE THINGS!!!!! once its better i will get it 5 stars.
"I do not like the fact that there is no goal,challenge about this game,you just drive without achieving or targeting anything...Good graphics ofcourse but terrible controls as well,atleast add a feature for controls (i prefer steering) and then also bring in some challenges in the game"
I had TWO ads WITH SOUND start playing within the first 30 seconds of exploring the menu BEFORE even starting a game. Graphics are par with other top racing games. Music is contrived and uninspiring. The physics engine is not terrible. Designed by bots for bot reviews.
"The first problem is the speed is not the real speed in real life. Need a steering calibration button and sensitivity controller and add more cars as well as the Lamborghini and Rolls-Royce and more and allow every coar to buy with money not with the milage. And save the settings (if I set the music volume to 0 it doesn't remain 0 when I restart the game) and engine, suspension, tire configerations."
lots of fun to play. I'm giving only 2 stars because of the constant number of ads popping up every 1 or so minutes. and even during my missions which makes it harder to complete. otherwise it is very entertaining.
"I have a problem that when I play the game, the graphics from Medium change into Low even if my mobile can run the Medium graphics very easily. You all devs should do something for it. And moreover I have some ideas. That u should add military vehicles and new maps and decrease the price of the expensive cars. Add new maps like military bases or military islands and beachs,ports and some real life locations. I gave it 2 stars because I have told u already my problems"
"Horrible - there was ads every 2 minutes, the map is buggy with the flip car option and you can glitch through terrain and buildings. You can use it to fly and its not good. The map textures are disgusting and the terrain is just sharp triangular shapes"
"Like it. But, Ads and the challenges are very hard now. I remember playing this when I was a kid. When this game had a lamborghini logo. It was pretty easy to unlock all cars. But, now the challenges feel a bit hard for mobile controlls. Cause they suck. Unlocking new maps are very hard. I would like it had no ads, easy challenges, races, easy map unlocking just these then it deserves 5 stars."
"Torture. The game was brill, the organision, even some of the graphics where good, but the ads are excessive. Literally every half a minute. I would never recommend this game."
It could have been a good game but the amount of advertisements completely destroy the fun of this game . There are way too many ads . Please decrease the amount of ads or atleast increase the time interval between two ads.
You get an ad every 5 minutes and 1 ad goes on for a minute and the only way to get rid of them is to pay 2$. Ohh and also every time you try to exit an ad it sends you straight to play store to download it. It's like the developers want us to play other games
This game is stupid litterally HD graphics is confusing at the load up cause the devs apparently don't know how to explain how to properly load HD graphics
I like this game most most most this is very new graphical game and a place 10 year old damn 12 year old now and i am playing it for 12 years and this is very very very best game and the car a unlock
"It's honestly a nice game, but it's just way outdated, and is lacking some features and team support. Also, it doesn't save your progress after logging in on another device. It just feels old and given up on."
"I liked the original more, maybe because im used to a more realistic ecperience like real car driving simulator from ovidue pop. This game is just non realistic, the car accelerates to fast, each control type is to sensitive and every time you pause there is an add. The original was better"
"It's actually a nice game but with all those ads it's impossible to enjoy it. It's like every two minutes you get interrupted from an ad. And I wouldn't pay 7,49€ per WEEK to go vip, even if I could afford it. I don't believe it's worth it."
"Used to enjoy playing this game with my daughter. Now you can't play it without the Google Play Games app. Used to be able to skip past the popup requiring GPG and still play it, but now you can't even do that. Attention Google and app developers: I don't care about leaderboards, cloud saving, competing with others, and other BS. Just want a decent game I can goof off with. This used to be one, but not anymore."
When i was about to download this game i thought it would be good but as i started playing it automatically's lack and becuz of this i had to exit the game and on the other side it has too much ads in it for everything while opening the garage etc.And it is too hard to make money aka u have to see very big ad for just a little money i don't prefer u guys to plz don't download this game and i think the people who created this game should work hard on it and have some updates.
I rated two star because there is a click of new skills didn't load
"The game used to be better. They had a huge update and it barely seems like the same thing, the update made it worse."
Boring and lack of customization for the vehicles very dull gameplay
"The game is very good but, I bot a offer of 17.000 coins and it was saying 3 cars plus 3 mega skins and I didn't get it 😡😡😡"
"Here in Guatemala, it works pretty well. However, there are some things that are completely annoying. If someone is calling me via WhatsApp, I have to close every other app to find the call. In addition, the voice mail system is terrible with atrocious sound quality that I can barely understand. It's the app that everyone uses here so I'm stuck with it too."
"The computer version is terrible. It takes several minutes to launch and often freezes and crashes: many times each day. It takes more than 10 seconds for any conversation to load after you click on it. The changes made in late 2022 on replying, forwarding, etc are worse than what existed before. I hate it and only use it because sometimes I have to share documents on my laptop. The computer version was never good, but it's gotten worse."
"Would be great if it could properly transfer contacts as opposed to choosing some at complete random while aslo refusing to store new numbers. The set up is a chaotic, not streamlined as well as being very picky on information transfer. MUCH MORE time needs to be spent on the organization and user friendly aspect if it's to remain relevant in the future."
"I've been using this app for nearly a decade, and though some new useful features have been introduced throughout the years, some other features have been limited or gotten worse as well. I remember being able to record and share lengthy videos (of 6+ minutes at some point). Then that got reduced to about 2 minutes, and now, with the latest updates, the video recording feature has been reduced TO 26 SECONDS. 26!!! Are you kidding me?"
"4/2/22Really dumb that I can't start new threads. I can respond to new messages, but can't send messages until someone else sends the 1st message. 3/6/23 ^^Still an issue. Notifications are totally random. Allowed background access. Have to obsessively check messages since i don't get notifications most of the time. Sometimes they come in immediately, other times an hour, and everything in between. These app developers are getting lazy."
"What have you done!! Why did you have to push split view (On Tablets) down user's throats without at least making it optional? You made it very difficult to use. Remember, it is a tablet, not a PC with a large screen! Terrible decision every which way you look at it. And yes, I looked all over for a possible solution, but all I found were complaints on the matter."
"The app is getting worse with each update. I've been a WhatsApp user now for at least 7 yrs. The icons on the screen that allow you disconnect the call suddenly disappear. I'm forced to ask the person I'm on the line with to disconnect the call. Also, if im out and talking, the call constantly disconnects. This was never an issue before. I'm not sure if the servers have been changed or theres just more ppl using the app."
"I'd give more than 2 stars if I could reach someone to resolve issue. Whenever I attempt to attach photos/video from gallery, it wont allow me to select them. Of course, I also have to select Gallery from the 3 buttons on the right, but regardless, I cannot select and send. This is very frustrating as I use this for work and used to be able to do this with captions for each pic. Now I have to attach, write caption, send and do it again (from another app!)"
"Unfortunately, good things don't last forever, especially apps. This used to be great. Now it's mediocre. I used to have to update my picture profile when I entered a new device or after a certain period of time. It was annoying but minor. Now it's hassling me about permission with confusing instructions. Yeah, they need competition to either make them keep up or drown them out so we can keep them or move on. For now, I guess I'll have a picture less profile."
"I have deleted this app. More than 4 times on the believe it will fix,,,not happening, the vids are each time shorter for sharing and also messages deleted them self, after some time, so the calls lost quality. I'm the problem since I keep downloading it back expecting a different outcome, jokes on me till something better competes with this app. I consider teslachat in the future."
"Seems every time this junk updates it changes settings, notifications, freezes, such a pain. I started using this app about 7 or 8 years ago, long before Meta bought it, and it was awesome, I'd sing it's praises to everyone and anyone, but now, it's become a shadow of what it was. Especially irritating is that notifications no longer work per chat, all it does is keep popping up a notification that I may have messages, it does it even for chats I've silenced, total garbage now"
"For communications, the app is fine. The redesign of the notification icon, which displays the sender's profile image, is a terrible idea. The previous icon was immediately recognizable. The current choice is dependent on there being contrast between the image and the background, which the developers cannot possibly guarantee. As a result, the icon for many of my contacts just looks like a smudge. In my opinion, this design choice is horribly flawed."
"Passing from one phone to another is stupidly antiquated and inpractical. It requires you to reinstall the app or it will not recognize your Drive back-ups, even though they are the only ones in the back-up folder... And if by a strike of bad luck one happens to click back-up in the new phone before restoring the previous file, the latter will be unrecoverably overwritten by the new one..."
"The in-app camera is horrendously bad. It just refuses to focus. The auto focus is never accurate, and the manual focus is just as bad. I find myself tapping away at the screen to try and get the shot into focus but it's almost always to no avail and in the end I almost always have to resort to the phone camera app. This issue exists almost exclusively for the rear camera."
The new split view on my tablet is horrible. If some people want or like it there needs to be the option to choose the previous full screen view. I use WhatsApp daily and was very happy with it. Now it looks cluttered and confusing. I do not want to see all my contacts and messages when am reading or sending a message to one of my contacts.
"I don't have any issues with the messaging part of the app. I have issues with backup. I have a 150 mbps Internet connection, and yet, every day, my backup starts at 2 am, and doesn't finish by even 8-830 am. I don't know why it takes so long, and now every day, each backup has also increased in size. Why is it necessary to backup old messages? They are already there. Just backup new messages and media. Very poor data management in the backup department, but that's just my experience."
"I've had this app for 8yrs and it's always been my favourite messaging app, but the last 6 months or so it's been so unreliable, notification sound is on yet messages come through silent I've missed so many important messages because it didn't make a noise. takes hours to deliver messages abroad when it never used to. When I'm in the middle of a conversation it tells me I may have new messages which then take forever to actually come through. Video call and phone call quality is atrocious fix it"
"This app played a big part in keeping contact with different people in my life. One thing I liked about whatsapp (when compared to telegram,etc) was how 'open' it felt. Since the last update, it is very claustrophobic to look at, and it interrupts our daily work. I am sure im not the only one with this issue. So please roll back this feature"
"It's a good app but I've been facing ""reconnecting"" issue for a long time. Whenever I receive or make a call, 1st thing that appears, is reconnecting and then voice breakdown starts. It happens time and again during every call. That makes me hard to have a conversation with anyone. I would like to request to resolve this issue. I'm unable to have a conversation with anyone while the issue is there. Thank you."
"I hate that my contact's status can be opened from 'Chat' menu through their profile picture. That's my quick access for contact's info and I don't really care about status, so that update is useless and just annoying. If you need some ideas for the next update, then make chat editable (and add 'edited' label and its collapsible history), or add option to select all chat/call at once, or let us have better quality for pictures/videos and add 'save data' option for those with slow connection."
I'm not sure when this started happening but the microphone access is constantly on all the time. I have the notification on as if it's actively using the microphone when when the app is not open or a call is being made. This seems like a security issue. The app is having the microphone on all the time without the app being used.
"I loved this app till now. It was my main app, I could send videos up to 35 min then they cut it down to 22 min now it's cut again down to 5 minutes so went to sending audios up to 30 minutes and today I went to send one and couldn't do it because it's cut down to 16 MB. Why would you change something so good into something no longer able to do. Please change it back.😥"
"Everything's perfect about the app...the new features that are being added with time makes it amazing to use..but I'd like to suggest one though. People mentioned on statuses should be able to get a notification just like in groups. Sometimes before you even get to know someone mentioned you then it's too late. I'm sure when this feature comes in, it'll make it increadible"
"I've been using WhatsApp for long time now, but the problems am facing nowadays are:1. When I want to send a video, if that video is more than 2 mins 50 second, that video will cut it self to balance it to that 2 mins and 50 second, and that is very terrifying 😠.2. Still about sending video, yesterday I send 7 videos, but that videos couldn't be sent, when they start loading, after they reached half, they will stop, and tell me to resend them or restart my phone, and I've did that so many times"
"I cant do voicenotes because for some reason known to y'all it doesn't send and neither can I listen to them, no matter the amount of data or wifi I use. Also I see the status updates but anytime I try to check it it doesn't load no matter what I do, and no it's not my network because other apps are working just fine Fix it as soon as possible it's annoying😒"
"It used to be my favorite call app, but the new split screen on Z-Fold mobile makes it very difficult to read messages. Please correct or put some options to make us able to change. It is now very bad. The old layout was very good and was a privilege. 3 stars for the update, it used to be 5 stars."
"It has, over the past few months, began to jam any other apps operating, especially meta apps, even if you turn off notifications or mute them. Additionally if you're operating with whatsapp open and another tab, the screen will flicker continually until you shut it off, which even for someone that doesn't suffer from epilepsy or photosensitivity is very irritating to the eye. Finally, while typing if you even look at the backspace key the wrong way it'll close tab. Bad."
"After changing my phone to Doogee S100 I have this annoying bug. Using WhatsApp on loudspeaker locks the sound volume to 100% and the sound sliders don't work. I can set them to zero and the loudspeaker is still on 100% volume. Contacted support twice and both times my issue wasn't solved, bad service. Also the sound quality on loudspeaker is not good. I get some sound distortion and random cracking noise coming from the loudspeaker. This app used to be a lot better in the past."
"From a week or two, when I send the videos on whatsapp a black overlay comes on the screen and destroys the whole video quality. Even after the update it doesnt get fixed. The video in my gallery is perfectly fine. It becomes like this only when I try to upload it on whatsapp. Please fix the issue"
"Terrible app. I don't know why I'm not able to fix this but this problem has been bugging me for years. My Whatsapp aren't recieving any notifications unless I open the app. So whenever I'm busy, I always wonder why my phone didn't rang or any notif coming. When I open the app, it went like crazy. 3 Missed calls and 200 messages from group without realizing it after 3 hours. Solutions aren't helping either, cause it mostly told me to check if I set it to silent mode. WHY WOULD I EVEN DO THAT? 😡"
"Please get rid of the split screen or at the very least give us the option as to whether we want it or not. It does not work, it is really bothersome! I hate seeing a full list of my contacts to the left of the screen when I'm reading and replying to a chat. It's really confusing. I can't see full pictures properly or reply properly either. I hate this change so much. Please give me the option of being able to open my chat to a full screen like before"
Many recent issues have led me to give a poor rating. Most notably notification content no longer showing in the notifications panel on my Samsung. I was also being constantly asked to update WhatsApp even though it was on the most recent version. Had to uninstall it which led to me losing many messages as I couldn't get in to the app to backup! Never had any problems until very recently.
The new split view for tablets is a very bad Ul experience; I have lost very precious screen estate just due to this silly design. I can no longer use right swiping to reply to a post in this split view (which cannot be disabled in tablets). I wish there was a method to revert to the previous version of WhatsApp! ☹️
"My preferred messaging app but recent issues are driving me mad. Phone calls automatically connect to Bluetooth so go straight to my watch which I can't seem to turn off. Also, notifications appear in the middle of the screen over the top of everything else. Again, can't seem to change this."
"Not so good experience on samsung fold 4 . Unable to download document, at times can't download video also. Not able to share video which is created from the device. Team, Kindly look into this. Experience is getting worse day by day"
"I may sound like a parrot, it was wonderful til update. Customer service scans for a phrase in your request followed with a cut n paste reply. In spite of showing side by side images, pre and post update pointing out that the new, faster version sent the image at 1/5 the size of the image sent with the pre update version! They respond with 'restart your phone' etc. Really ? The conversation was initially about Whatsapp for desktop!"
"I forget my WhatsApp end-to-end encrypted backup password and have not 64 digits key. I have 6 years old chats in my backup. I have backups, databases and media in my mobile storage. I have all these above folders, but I can't recover. I am depressed and in anxiety condition and my mental health is affected due to Whatsapp backup. My data is important. People do the backup, because, data is crucial. WhatsApp need to introduce more methods for end-to-end encrypted backup password recovery."
"Since past few days, I am not able to send multiple documents at once. Only the first selected document is sent and the rest are just dropped. You have to send them individually one by one. It is becoming tedious and irritating. Please resolve this ASAP. My device is OnePlus 8T."
The app is great to work with! But the latest Split screen view is so annoying to the users who are using it on tabs! I request to fix that make a option to enable it for those who want that and disable it for those who don't want it
"You can enable one more option both in groups & individual chats ie deletion of chats between the dates along with clear chat option. Why back up not happening with 100% data. Only partial back up happening, when we re install the app. I lost lot of data. One more suggestion, for selected chats, mobile no change option"
This update is not useful for tablet user bcz not as user-friendly as previous version. Not any setting there to use previous interface and existing interface is very annoyed. Not option available for replying to particular message by tagging. And compulsory splitting screen on tablet is not pleasing to use.
"As of a couple months ago I keep having an issue where the mic is being used in the background even when I am not using the app, I clear cache, force close the app n still it's being used. I understand y'all may be spying on people but do not affect my battery while doing so!!"
"WhatsApp is good. If you guys fix the voicenote-playing stuff, something to do with motion sensors that turn off the screen when you play a voicenote, or lower the voicenote volume, or automatically pause it... It's super annoying by the way. Stop that, mehn. I am so sick and tired of it. Let's speak the truth. How does that help??? Huh? Just scrap it mehn. Or make it optional. It tempts my patience everytime. Thank you."
"I just updated my phone a few days ago and just was wondering whh my pop up notifications don't work anymore. I check the settings and it tells me, my version does not support it anymore. This is so annoying! Constantly things are being taken away for no reason!! Just leave stuff alone. I was using those faithfully and really loved it"
"everything is good and all, but the only thing that's bad is we still can't switch between accounts or devices easily. doesn't backup perfectly or loads them well. I'll change it to five stars once this is fixed. it's disappointing how one of the most used messaging apps has this kinda issue. the faq section answers this by saying frequently switching devices or accounts may result in a permanent deletion of account. like why is this so restricted in this aspect..."
"🤞 crossed that this WhatsApp bug 🐞 doesn't return. My fone found your problem. What you couldn't find. And factory reset itself. And I add too start again from scratch. For company's addresses, passwords, info, etc. Don't keep it on your phone. Keep it separate in a note book 📖 , diary write ✍️ all your info down using a pen and paper only. Don't store it in the network notebook. As sometimes not only your apps crash like this one. But also your games can play up as well or not work properly."
"Okay.... all I want to do is send a picture from my gallery to someone that needs the info. The app just keeps asking me to turn on the permissions... which are already ""on"" to accomplish this.... I have stopped and restarted the app, updated it etc... lame that a basic function like this is a hassle."
"Overall the app experience is pretty good until this wierd update came on allover the iPads tablets like whatever this split screen this is horribly awfull I thought I connected my iPad with my Laptop so it is like this but everyone who is iPad user is getting this wired thing! I am using WhatsApp since 2020 it was working perfectly fine until one day WhatsApp is updating show up the split thing came,.. this bro can't even be removed...! If you can help all the iPad users so please! thank you..."
"I use this app all the time and its where most people message me but i hate how its constantly frozen in place. Extremely low volume, even on high i can only hear it if i place it against my ear. The pause, and slide forward or back on voice messages doesnt work so i have to completely swipe off my screen and restart the message and listen to the whole thing again. It got stuck on 1.5 playback speed so i deleted the whole app and downloaded it again and its still trash."
"Up to today worked ...close to satisfactorily.. the app was nice before was sold to facebook. but today... just opened app under mobile i-net and it crashed! and asked for new registration! tried open on PC- the same problem!!! I'm actually long term but very ""light"" user-not keeping opened many chats & groups. once read about that bug, but never in 11years of using Whatsapp ,that happened to me! also, when registered, some of non recent but important chats disappeared .."
"The new Whatsapp update on Tablet is terrible. The split screen is fine for desktop experience, but not this. My Swipe to Reply feature is no longer working on both personal and business. I use Whatsapp for work and losing this feature (even in the personal version) has frustrated me to no end. When are they rolling out a fix??!"
"Used WhatsApp for years but having the same experience as other users. Since the latest update, can suddenly no longer send videos longer than a few minutes as it just cuts it down. Doesn't matter if you use your phones lowest recording settings or not like WhatsApp suggested when I spoke to them. Was a great app but if this is something new and isn't a fault, definitely not an improvement and very much a deterrent to use WhatsApp."
"I never make a review about any apps since smartphone was found. But since you change your layout, i find it REALLY annoying. We can't swipe message to reply, that split screen, just like whatsapp web? For small monitor (i use samsung fold), its very2 annoying, the photo/video's thumbnail are too small, the chat room, are too narrow (i feel like seeing a bad layout tables of word docs). Why dont you just set it up to the older version??"
"It's a good app overall, but there's one issue, and it's only with the Motorola one fusion Plus , on video calls the camera quality is just gravely distorted, even to the sender, like i can see my reflection in the pop up just blur and distorted. I hope they fix the issue soon. I could send screenshots but i don't know just where to."
"App was working perfectly fine until the update within the last couple of hours. Phone calls won't go through. Pop up comes up stating Whatsapp has stopped working and forces close. Plus before that update a lot of times the phone won't ring when I get a phone call, I would just receive a missed call notification. When a new update fixes those bugs I will edit my rating."
"One annoying periodic reoccurring insurgent behavior of this app is that: IT SUDDENLY REFUSES TO OPEN/ LAUNCH/ RUN, as I intend to get in. When I tap it, it just shows the white screen and green icon for about 5 seconds then bounces off, over and over. Data check is on. I restarted my phone at least 3 times, no way. Finally, am compelled and constrained to delete and reinstall the app, thereby, losing my chat history. I deactivated my auto save enablement because it filles up my memory space."
"I don't know who they get to test the changes, but they aren't of the same mind as I am. This ridiculous tablet spilt screen is beyond annoying. I don't need to see my contacts at the expense of almost half of my screen. You should have had the ability to minimize it. You need to add a toggle on and off icon at the top of the screen, or an option to turn it off in settings."
"The WhatsApp layout was way more than perfect before the update and now the split on my samsung tab sucks. It's so complicated and confusing. It's hard to text and manage, so uncool. We should have an option to choose between the layouts, I recommend. I prefer the full classic layout more."
The new split screen update on tab users is horrible. The screen looks a mess and there are difficulties for reading as well as writing messages. The slide right option to reply is also not available...This has led to inconvenience for users. Kindly give us the original layout back with the slide to reply option....
"love the app 'cause it is simple and efficient. But, the chat doesn't backed up in the clouds. In the event of emergency such as failed to backup caused by the phone's insufficient storage, all the chat history just gone bye bye. It's frustrating, no chance of restoring them and losing those chats forever, except from manually backed up history"
"I like the new features, it's a better experience but now sending voice notes is a trouble. It just keeps loading endlessly and I can't get my message across😫😫😫 Please fix ASAP!!!!!!!!!!"
"I really dont like whats app any more , It has many bugs , Last night, I shared a photo in the status section, and the picture went by itself and I saw that it was not my statuses, the statuses of my contacts were not there, but others were seeing my statuses, which I did not see myself, and then my WhatsApp date automatically changed to 2012 and All the contacts last seen are on December 7, 2012 and whatever I did, it didn't work"
Each update keeps changing features it can be annoying at times... The option to mute the sound notifications but still show a chat's notification at the notification bar has completely gone. Now it's only completely muting notifications without the option for certain chats to appear on the notification panel without any sound... Please bring that feature back it was very helpful!!
"Whatsapp used to be a great app but there is now a thing which I hope is unintentional as it is really frustrating. When you type something and then press the ""gallery"" button and choose a photo your whole message gets deleted now which I find very annoying. Please whatsapp fix this it is so frustrating now"
"There is been a bug in WhatsApp which is still not fixed. Every time when the video plays in the Status, it fails to load and loads status of the next person. When multiple videos are added continuously, then last portion of that video don't play. It needs to be reloaded to watch it. One more bug is that while viewing the texts if you slightly pull up the texts..the texts will move up very far into the old chats....plz fix this bug as i m not able to read messages properly. Plz fix this asap."
I have been receiving many calls including video calls from unknown numbers mostly from other countries. It high time to introduce the feature to choose who can call on whatsapp; otherwise the platform will become more and more scammer-friendly.
Everything was nice until recently I faced a weird glitch. Whenever I want to send multiple photos in document format and even though I select all the pics which I want to send it sends only the first pic that I have selected cancelling all the rest of the pics. I don't know what's the issue but whatsapp doesn't allow me to send multiple photos in document format. Please kindly look into this issue asap !
The in chat camera feature doesn't work properly. This has been going on since a long time. Whenever i click a photo it doesn't capture and i have to close and restart the app atleast 2 times minimum to click a photo.
"Overall, this app is really awesome and I'm in love with the new features. For some reasons, I had to clear all my data and re-sign in. But anytime I try to sign in, notice appears that the app has stopped and it will automatically close. I've restarted my phone, restarted the app, waited for hours to try again and so on but the app keeps crushing. Something should be done about it please because it's the only app I currently use for both personal and educational communications."
Am using spark 10 the issues are that I can't get notifications on the notification bar or screen when the screen is locked tried to set it it shows pop up notification are not available on this version. I don't understand pls I want it fixed
"The only problem I have with this application is that it compresses the picture's quality and video quality, which leads to the recipient receiving blurry pictures and unclear information. My suggestion is to stop compressing pictures and videos , let us choose our media quality because for now even if you change the settings from data saver to best quality it won't make any difference the picture will just remain blurry."
I've been a WhatsApp user for many years now and I used to think it was a great app but recently I have not been able to send audio from programs to my friends that are over 16mb like I was once able to do. This is a bummer because that was my primary reason for using this app. I'm debating now whether to keep it..😕
"This app is really amazing but in the latest updat in tab, there are MANY BUGS, when we have to share anything, it doesn't and can't exit with this(←) button. Also, when I open app and I see first chat, then move in next chat and chat once, I don't know how but automatic open first chat. So PLEASE fix this bug."
"Having a serious problem When I send messages it doesn't go to everybody I send to,it will show a red mark indicating it has not gone to the person am sending it to. It just started happening recently and I see it as a big challenge so I am hoping u find a way to correct the problem and find a solution to the problem. Also the messages that are sent do not go to everybody,it will go to some and not go to some. So please information is to be provided and the settings need to be changed to a mor"
"Bug: Chat randomly scrolls to the top for no reason, really annoying. Not a problem with the device since I use other messaging apps as well. Also: The default pen tool should be the thinnest one and camera shutter button should be just a bit bigger, UX testing team should stop slacking off so much :P Volume down button on incoming call should silent the call. Just basic stuff that should be obvious."
"When I'm in a video call or normal call on whatsapp, I can't what's a video on all the browsers, it'll load the video on browser but it won't play, if u unpause the video it'll just play one frame and pauze again, i tired everything and didn't work so whatsapp is the problem, pls fix this"
"Ive used WhatsApp for almost a decade. Time length to send videos had randomly gotten shorter. My fiancé and I always send video msgs throughout the day and he's had this same isse where our video times have gotten shorter. We would have plenty storage, but it's only allowing less than 2 min to record. I've restarted my phone too and no recent update needed. Idk what's goin on but it's annoying"
"The app had been working wonderfully until recent update. My new messages are unable to load even when my data is on, until I open the whatsapp app. Besides, the app closes when opening some of the messages. I have to reopen the app when it happens like that. The feedback sometimes are, *the update contains a bug...* Such experience is disgusting. Please work on it"
Generally an okay app but recently the call function's speaker doesn't work properly. The call will actually get softer if you activate the speaker which isn't that great. It used to work just fine
"Privacy is very close to me! And to everyone else's too. I joined a group and i want to leave it but couldn't do it because whatsapp will notify everyone,which i don't like. This is full violation of my privacy! I don't want others to know about my exit. I am requesting the WhatsApp authority to stop notifying others whenever someone want to leave the group! Thanks!"
"It works but it's so basic and even primitive. Data not stored on the cloud so in the event of changing device I have to manually backup and restore my chat, provided the restore process doesn't fail. The only great change after decades is I no longer have to keep my phone on to use the web version, which should have been the case since ages ago. You could have done so much more, but you won't cause nobody will leave anyway. The only reason I'm still here is cause everyone else is still here."
"Does pretty good photo sharing but is a lame text editor for composing messages, can't even enter a new line. Would likely have been even better if Facebook had not acquired it. Was it always FB's strategy to not add features or improve it."
Kindly give an edit option. It sucks when written a long message but unfortunately because one or two word the message gets misinterpreted. So in order to get relief of that please put an edit button. Thank you
"Great app , but the quality of the photos when sent and updated on status is extremely low , please edit this.then comes the issue of when u type nd want to put words at the bottom of your picture but it shifts and looks weird."
"I love this app. Although recently, I haven't been getting message notifications at all. I tried everything, and it's clearly not that my notifications are muted or turned off. They just don’t load until I manually open the app myself. It's frustrating because I rely on this app to communicate with family, friends and peers."
"The split screen update is hurting the eyes. My device is a tablet and its hard to use this app with new update until the screen is rotated to landscape. The messages can be replied to, with a swipe. Please keep the layouts as an option instead of permanent."
"This update is very bad as does not support many functions. In the name of privacy why to change the features which do not affect the privacy of chats. Cannot send multiple fotos in documents what to do in case of emergency, do we have to play with single single files to send? Plz don't mess with the convinience in name of update"
Having problem with multiple images as document sharing ...only one at a time is sent which is very much annoying. Kindly fix this asap. Was a great feature.
"I can't lie, I do love this app - I use it basically every day and it is very good for groupchats. Unfortunately, recently I have been having lots of issues like how sometimes I dont receive certain messages or messages just won't deliver without any Internet issues. One BIG issue I have been dealing with is that it won't let me message only one specific person. It makes it look (for the both of us) that we have been blocked. I can't message him or anything and I can't find anything to help it."
"I'm really disappointed with the new split view feature, as it makes it much harder to read my messages. Especially for Z Fold 4 l. Furthermore, I've noticed that there's no option to revert back to the old view, which is really disappointing. I hope that the developers will take this feedback into consideration and improve the app in the future. Overall, I'm not a fan of this up"
Why did you eliminate the option to record long videos. Stop making all these meta fb apps the same. I'm not sending clips to my family. Most times I'm sending events that are taking place. Bring back the ability to capture and send videos as long as the user wants to.
"It is difficult to reinstall after uninstalling. I was having problems with the WhatsApp on my Tablet like my screen spilted into 2 so I decided to uninstall, then trying to reinstall, the sms for code did not drop onto my phone, the call that came in cut immediately I picked it. It is not allowing me to ask for code again for the next 24 hours, this is not fair, I will miss a lot of important messages during that waiting period 😭. Just found split screen is from WhatsApp. It is ANNOYING 😞"
"There's too many glitches with every upgrade. Overlapping audio while viewing statuses, the constant ""reconnecting "" during video calls and audio calls, the fact that GB users can even communicate with normal Whatsapp users. It used to be fun and easy to use but now there's just too much clutter Zuckerberg if I CATCH YOU?"
It was a good one until they started to incorporate ads every now and then. I understand it's for commercial reasons but it's on the wrong platform where fast communication take place. I'd recommend you restore the previous one where no ads took place. Kindly
"Well, I suggest that the next update is feature ads that we can make videos/pictures. It's been a long time to upload videos/pictures 24 Hours is gone, so if possible make it a feature like Instagram or tiktok. but don't Get rid of it a status feature."
"I am constantly contacting the whatsapp team asking them to resolve my issues but to no avail. The app is constantly crashing in my phone. I have tried every viable solution offered to me by the team but it is just not working. Everyday I have to uninstall and reinstall the app. What is the permanent solution? I use an android phone, there is ample storage, i regularly clear cache memory."
They keep deactivated my account when I did nothing wrong it's becoming frustrating everytime my account is constantly being reviewed and it take 24hours for them to carry out this review . I have no problem with this it's the consistent reviewing that is becoming annoying even when it's clear that I did nothing wrong. I always make sure I don't go against the rules set by this App. Please fix this issue
"it used to be great, but now.. what the hell is wrong with this app?? notifications often don't appear until you open the app. Because of this I too often missed many important things. I once thought the problem is on my phone, but I've switched phones now and it is still like this, even my friend's phones have the same problems. so I know the problem is from the app."
"The mobile version is good enough, but there's a problem with the web version, I can't download the photo and video simultaneously, instead, I have to manually select all the photo and download, and I have to open up the video manually one by one in order to be able to download the video, it really sucks 👎"
"It's a good texting app but I have a few problems.... 1) the search option doesn't work. it always says 'not found' if you search something one clearly said. 2) the emojis for Samsung are really ugly..like pls just let us use our own ones...3) if you compare it to the apple messaging app, you could see the clear differences in them and how the Apple messager is way better and developed than this. 4) I understand all apps have problems but your not fixing the problems in your app"
"I needed an app between friends with different phones for an upcoming wedding (couldn't use my preferred). This app is awful, it doesn't work on some wifi networks so I have to turn off wifi to communicate and then it takes forever for our messages to come through. Took forever to connect to even use, both phone and desktop (latter took literal days to ""connect"" and when it finally did, the link expired🙃). Plus limited reacts. Will delete after the wedding, this was horrendous."
App is unusable for me. I will be on a call and it will close the app mid-sentence. I can't have a five minute conversation without having to call back at least a coupe times. Half the time when receiving a call I will hear my phone ringing but nothing pops up to be able to answer the call. It's nice when it works but for me it rarely does.
"I have bold text set in the system settings and unlike the other apps, Telegram doesn't fully and properly support it. No bold text in chats, even settings have some lines are bold and some are not, makes it look like the code has been made by a child. Please fix this, because there's no way to leave you a feedback through the app, neither should I care about it, since you have to."
The reason why I started using this in the first place is because back then you could send raw video/picture uncompressed. Now since recently I just learned that the media I send is being compressed to half the file size and the pixel resolution is lower - completely defeating the total purpose on why I started using this app in the first place. I'm going back to generating links with Drive. Thumbs down!
"It used to work very well. All over sudden, the voice message stops working. Whenever I send someone a voice message, it doesn't go. I have good internet connection, I updated my phone, I tried different things, nothing worked. I use to think that it was better than whatsapp, but now I'm getting disappointed ☹️👎🏾👎🏾 PS: at first, I thought the problem was my phone, but some friends told me the same issue (when they send voice message, it doesn't go!!!)"
"The app is as good as a messaging app could get. Could say that it is the best one there is at the moment. But there's an issue that I makes me unable to use it, so what is the point of having it. I open the app and it works fine for, mostly, 5 seconds. Afterwards, it goes to a ""Conecting..."" status. If I close the app and Turn off and on my wifi in my phone, it works again for 5 seconds. For some reason it works better with mobile data but so many people have this problem."
"I love this app, but it has been having a consistent problem accross multiple phones now. After a while, the notifications don't nest themselves together. Instead, it shows all my chats as separate notifications. When you're in as many chats as I am, it gets annoying to have your entire notifications bar filled with telegram. I've reached out to the support team about this and never received a response. So far, the only solution is to uninstall the app, and then reinstall, losing all settings."
"Everything is nearly perfect, except for a glaring privacy issue. Please give us an option to either disable contact sync entirely, or to disable the ""Who can find me through my number."" There's a large amount of people I know that flatout won't use Telegram because of it. This ""feature"" ends up outing many people to their family, co-workers, and friends a lot of the time. And I'm sure so many people would LOVE if we could disable it entirely."
"Thank you for your great app. Recently I've been having to deal with 2 problems. The first one is when there is no internet connection and I happen to see something that I want to save, I forward it to my saved massages and then when there is connection, sending fails and I lose the media I wanted. The second one is when I'm downloading some music files or media and it pauses it automatically."
"The app is good. But has some problem. The most annoying one is the voice call. No matter how good both of our connections are after 2-3 minutes it will show ""Reconnecting"" and I would hear some beeps. But it never reconnects. So I have to end the call and make it again and again after 2-3 mins. And another problem is ""last seen recently"". It's so annoying. Why can't you just show the exact time like other apps? Like "" last scene X minutes/hours ago"". I hope you will fix these bugs in future."
"This app is nice to have for a private conversation, over a WiFi network, when you want to send a free text or phone call. Only problem is it doesn't work right all the time. It is hit-n'-miss as to whether it'll work. I'll wait all day with it cycling through saying ""connecting,"" before I have a minute or two that it works, and then back to ""connecting."" And yes, that's even after clearing out the cache and storage, etc. Over and over. I don't like to give poor ratings, but it's honest."
It used to be perfect. It keeps saying connecting when I am clearly on either data or wifi! Everything else works and is fast. It gives me phone notifications of displayed new messages but I cannot see them in the app (Even as I type this). I cannot also send photos/videos. It sits and has the x with the white outlined circle going on forever
"Noticed I don't get notifications until I open my phone or the app. Checked all the settings to make sure my notifications weren't muted and that's not the issue. seems to be a telegram connection issue. I have it set to run in background, but it still doesn't send me notifications sometimes. Update: It's somehow getting worse, 10 notifications just didn't come through until I opened the app. I think its because of the long ""Connecting"" issue and it's ruining the experience making it unusable"
Constantly sending peek notifications from the taskbar that are displayed on your screen. There's no way to turn them off and they're continually interfering with what you're trying to do on your phone. It will not allow notifications to just remain in the pull down notification bar like other apps do. Super annoying!
"I have been using this app for a long time now. But 3 or 4 last updates were so bad. When someone calls me, app is not ringing at all and just sending me ""missed call"" notifications (sometimes I don't get them unless I open the app). And now I can't even return just missed calls, it shows ""waiting..."" and put it on a speaker. Developers have been adding a lot of useless things, plus they are not fixing bugs that they created, but making them worse. Work on it!!!!"
"App is running pretty bad lately. Constant freezing and some crashing, slow to connect whether on wifi or data, just a bad experience as of late. Very frustrating at times. Know it's not net as other apps work fine. Phone has been rebooted more than once, not the phone. Have cleared cache multiple time and doesn't fix anything either. Used to run better before one of the last couple of updates. Update: Forgot to add it also locks my phone multiple times on occasion. It's incredibly infuriating."
"First, respect to Telegram for being supported by so many volunteers. And among the reasons it is not the platform I want to use, and I only have it for the three people who choose to use it exclusively, is it allows for contacts you long ago deleted from your phone. They aren't in the cloud anymore, and Telegram is constantly wired to your phone's history. This is ridiculous, possibly dangerous, and completely counter to what people need where their security is concerned."
"I love the messaging portion of the app. It is fantastic and seemless across my devices and it is simple enough that my family and my girlfriend and I use it for messaging. Love the stickers and customization. My ONE complaint, which is especially important right now, is that the video chat is kind of clunky with PIP and it gets really slow. Also, the connection noise never plays at the call volume I have set, but instead at full blast. I really really find the video chat aspect very important."
"The notification settings on this are absolutely terrible. I'll set it one way and it'll last for an hour, maaaaaaybe 2, before it resets to default. I tried completely silencing it and it's the same thing. If I didn't HAVE TO have this for work, I would uninstall and delete forever. It's especially disruptive while driving, which is my actual job. The actual app is fine but constantly having to reset the notifications and wasting my time is ridiculous."
"I don't know what's going on but for the last couple weeks I've been having some weird/annoying things happening. Gifs that get shared in groups I'm in are either not playing, zoomed in or part of the top and bottom get cut off when I click on them to full screen them. And then, I also had gifs that I sent suddenly get sent as photos. I don't have a update that's needed cuz I've checked. This is inconvenient/annoying. Please try and figure this out so I can enjoy the app thoroughly."
"Came from what's app and I wanted to try something new. The app feels good and fast, but it misses some great features for instance record video directly through the app, start message if I'm chatting with someone and they send me something important telegram doesn't have the option for me to star the msg and it can be saved in the app so I can have access to it easily and it doesn't have the option for the consumer to use wallpaper or add their own picture in the background etc"
"This app was great until an update sometime in February. Now the app frequently gets stuck in a ""connecting"" status. Fixing it is inconsistent and either requires connecting to a VPN, force closing everything and resetting connection, or restarting the entire device. Very frustrating since I have moved a number of people over to Telegram and now it's not working for them. Many are switching back to WhatsApp or Signal. Not as secure, but at least they always work. Very disappointed."
"Notifications are a complete mess: There are multiple categories labeled as ""Default"" or ""In-App Default"" in each section. There are categories labeled ""Silent"" that nevertheless produce notifications. The category ""Internal Notifications"" refuses to be disabled. When I disable it, I'll soon get notifications from that category and find that it's enabled again. As a result, I have to completely disable notifications from the app, which mostly defeats the purpose of even having it installed."
"Been using telegram for a few years and the biggest issue that keeps this app from being nearly perfect is still unfixable. If you sign up with your real phone number, and your friend signs up to telegram and they have you in their phone contacts, it shows them your profile right off the bat. There is no chance to be able to separate your profile from anyone who just so happens to have your number in their contacts. Massive privacy issue, please remove this feature or add a feature to stop it."
"Lots of unnecessary changes, I absolutely love this App but it feels like every quarter this is a feature that is just being Gutted or hidden behind a paywall. The latest one is being able to view the size of a video when moving from video to video, this usually useful when avoiding downloading a large file when on a budget. Now the Feature is just gone for no reason"
"Honestly, the app was pretty amazing but with each update things get worse and over time nothing seems to work right. For example, before when you'd download a video, you could pause the download midway and and get back to it later. Now, if you pause the download, all data is lost and you have to start from zero. Additionally, the app takes up too much storage even with continuous deleting and reinstalling. Something needs to be done about some of these things cause the app is becoming nuisance"
"It's a fine app and has a lot of bright sides but for the fact that the app fails to allow you send videos, files docs or whatsoever to a platform out of the app, take for example, it fails to let you forward files from a chat to wherever, say, through Bluetooth to another phone, Xender, or else where is insane. Plus whatever file saved does not save into your phone's storage but to the app itself, preventing you from accessing that file, if ever the app gets deleted or for any other reason."
"I really used to love the app but recently there have been so many bugs! Notifications don't show up for one chat specifically, even though I haven't muted the chat in any way. Uninstalling and reinstalling helps, but it happens again and it's very annoying. Attempts to force stop and clear cache don't work. Edit: It still hasn't been fixed, I have updated and reinstalled multiple times."
"Just learned the hardway that there is no proper backup/restore features for chats! This app blows out of the water other messaging apps, so these features are a must have guys! Let us backup and restore chats like other messaging apps, and would be even better to have a lock feature to prevent accidentally losing a chat. Desktop app export features don't bring back regular chat functionality in case of an accident."
"The chat history is deleted by itself, messages are not deleted, it's me who click on the ""delete"" button messages are delivered to chats or groups only with a delay, sometimes it can be 39 seconds, and sometimes several hours. I can't edit messages about the fact that they were sent 10 minutes ago. These errors have recently begun to occur in telegram constantly. Please do something about it."
"Telegram is one of the best messaging app I've ever used, its animated stickers and emotions Icons is incredible, also the video and pic editing is dope, the ability to crop videos in the app is on another level. 💯but I rated it two stars because of the latest update, after I updated the app I've been having issues sending messages, it takes forever for one message to go through. I wish it would be fixed by the developers. Thanks"
"Since the last two updates, Telegram is loading slowly, media in chats appear very slowly, and they are also downloaded very, very slowly, animation is also slow. More importantly, the keyboard is freezing so that it's almost impossible to type correctly, the keyboard reacts very, very slowly when tapping. Is it possible to downgrade, by the way?!... 🤔"
"Please disable the proximity sensor when a call is on speaker! Absolutely infuriating trying to use your phone and the screen turns off and on every 5 seconds. Work needs to be done to make calling more natural, voices speed up and down and calls can be extremely echoey, especially when on speaker phone. The techno noise that plays just before a call connects is grating and unnecessary. Just give users a reliable experience in a familiar way before trying to be overly creative with UX"
"No notification sound. So annoying. Had to Uninstal after every update and the notification would return when re-installed. With the last update, no combination of phone and app permissions will bring back the notification sounds. So sad that I never know if I have a message, unless I stop, open the app to see if there is a message. Fix it please or post on the app how to recover the notification sound after every update"
"Great App, Awful Notification Paradigm. I would love to be able to keep notifications on with telegram, but they are simply too oppressive. Notifications reappear when I've canceled them, constantly. Furthermore, the way the notification categories are structured are essentially meaningless, with the majority of notification categories called ""other"" or ""default"". I get 50 notifs per day from TG and there seems to be no meaningful way to reduce or filter this, without turning them off entirely"
"The app has been lagging and buggy ever since the last update; some chats don't load, they are stuck on sync. At times, the app just gives up and freezes and there's just no fixing the issue. My friend using an iPhone says that they can't see the images they send in a chat, the photos turn white. Please fix these issues!"
"Telegram is a great app becasue it is so easy to use. Plus it can be used across multiple platforms including Windows, Mac, iPhone and Android. I also enjoy how custumizable the app is. Custom notifications and themes for chats is great. The widget on the homescreen does not update in real time which is annoying so please work on that telegram!"
"1. Ability to change the size of 2x2 widget. 2. to set passcode for each profile within the app. 3. BUG: when in chat (not in a call), proximity sensor triggers voice message recording and darkens the screen 4. to randomly add different types of distortion to your voice when you record messages, videos, in calls. So no one could cut your messages into something you didn't say, + no one could teach NN to imitate your voice"
"There's so many issues with the username function.. The username isn't claimed nor it is in the blockchain?? What?? Is there a username change limit?? It kept saying ""This username is already taken"" and when i searched it up there is no account who uses it. After i tried to put the username in, it said ""An error occured"". I also can't seem to edit my channel? And it keeps on pending/loading too! Fix your apps, please."
Overall it's a good app but some annoying glitches are there. Not able to resume download from where it stopped before. Partially downloaded data gets deleted and starts from beginning if couldn't complete the download on a single stretch.
"If we search for someone in our contact list, it shows some other person who are in telegram not in my contact list. It's good, but it's showing dirty pics DP in the same name whom we search. Really it's frustrating. Kindly remove those contacts from telegram. Are else edit to show only what we search in our contact list."
"Very very bad update. You cannot select the profile picture using file manager.. it shows all the photos(screenshot, camera, download).. it is very difficult to choose the picture this way. This is not a good update.. is it necessary for you to put finger in updates.. earlier it was very good"
"I really enjoyed this app. The last update made it unusable to the point it just says connecting, and hours later, it's still saying connecting. Messages won't go through. Uninstalled, restarted my phone and nothing."
Low quality of release versions in last six months. A lot of bugs and some optimization problems. Don't have any idea why I bought a premium subscription for all my family for the next year. As an active user since 2014 I am a little bit shocked 🙄
Files are getting removed automatically from the recent downloads don't know why. Also it is difficult to access the downloaded files in the file manager. We have to go very deep inside folder after folder to reach the downloaded cache files.
"Before updating the app, I was able to open a photo in a group/chat and swipe righ/left in order to see the next photo or video, and if the next/previous was a video I was able to see the whole detail about the video including the size of the video whether it was 8MBs or 2MBs. But after the latest update I can't see the size of the video when I swipe left/right and can't see the size whem the videos are arranged in groups. So please fix this please."
"The privacy setting doesn't work. Even when it's set to not showing when you are online, it IS visible to others. So is my telephone number- despite being set to not being visible to anyone. Could you advise? Also, since the latest update the app crashes constantly and group notifications can't be turned off reliably."
"Update 9.4.8 didn't fix the video messages issue for me, they are still not using the full fov of Pixel 6 Pro front camera, being too cropped in. It was ultrawide before, looked and worked good, similar to how video messages work on latest iPhones with ultra wide front cameras, but now it's too close to my face, video starts with a black screen, shows a black screen when switching cameras, thus making using video messages quite undesirable. It was last fine on 9.1.3, so I have to stay there."
"You're restricted to an extremely limited selection of emoji reactions to put on others' messages. You're given a choice of about 50 or so, and they're very poorly chosen, giving you very few useful ones. You can pay money to unlock various groups of others, but even if you pay, there's no way to use most of the normal ones. You can only use them in your own messages. It's surprising how frustrating this turns out to be in practice."
"I really don't understand what's wrong with the app lately, medias don't download even after clicking on them and for like 2days now whenever I click on links from the app I don't get directed. This has really slowed down my work, I'd have to start writing down links and then go to my browser to paste. Please something should be down about this my app can't he up to data and still be having issues on a newly updated app"
"Bought premium but can't utilize it. I bought premium only to have faster downloads but for some reason it starts downloading all the hundreds of videos in a channel automatically, and they keep downloading even if I try to stop it. This is affecting the speed of the download I want to make. It has been stuck, and I can't do anything. Please help."
It's showing lots of problem from one month even after updating its latest version. When we try to make call it shows waiting for like 10 times or even more then that when a call is placed. And video call option is of no use because we can't make a video call. Previous version of telegram was far better as prior to this there was not even a time where we could make calls and videos call convientlty.But now neither we can place call nor video call through telegram. Please work on this issue.
I think the cost is too high. I would happily pay around 1€ per month. Many people would. These subscription models for every app out there are getting out of hand. Possible it will be a better deal if the whole family is using the same app but kids are not using Telegram. Will family members actually share the subscription?
"Wow, what an awful app ! Just disheartening to see that they ruined it. Full of bugs nowadays, downloads get stuck midway and then never seem to start again. Also the login part has become a nuisance too, most of the time I don't recieve the OTP only, and get stuck at the login interface for an eternity or so. Also they reduced the download speed too much, to the extent that normal non-premium users have come to hate the app. Searching for other alternatives. Thanks, for ruining the app."
"The latest update has changed my custom settings for several chats. Previously they were set up to vibrate without any sound. Now they make a noise. I can disable the sound, but they no longer vibrate ☹️"
"Great app. But we need specail features like forwarding messages without quoting the name of the message, directly saving files to cloud, when downloading file it won't show the percentage and so many other things. don't make us regret logging out of plus telegram."
"I have a problem with watching video files downloaded in the app. When I click the file it says, ""you don't have applications that can handle the file type 'video/MP4', please install one to continue. But I have video playing apps installed. I can watch the video only after saving the file to downloads or gallery."
"It used to be the best. Now it merely reaches ok. Some groups were I'm admin change themselves to supergroup without touching them. The chat skins only last applied for as long as you use it that time, next time you open it'll be back to default. Lately some image galleries keep appearing and disappearing randomly. A bunch of annoying bugs that are lowering the standard of the app."
"New update, doesn't work to save media in gallery. I have tryed it since 1 months it is not working... Pls resolve this issue. It's irritating for checking photos , videos every time need to go into file manager and open the teligram file and access that perticular media. It's a headaqe.. Please do take action on it as soon as possible."
Overall it is a good software but the it keeps crashing very often and just doesn't start again. Telegram has stopped responding shows up and then it just never starts again until you uninstall and install it again. I've checked it properly and it is not occuring because of my smartphone incompatible or something like that but there is a serious issue with telegram itself.
"My favourite messenger, everything is great except for calling. The connection during the call is really poor despite fast internet and good phone connection. The call loses connection every 5-10 min for no clear reason. Other messengers, such as Messenger from Facebook, has a perfect call quality, I experience this issue only with Telegram. The video call has even worse connection."
If any app have many features but do not work properly Then what is the benefit of that features. Like 1.download section sometimes visible most times not visible 2. In previous version download video can play in external player but now that option is not there. 3.sometime it stop downloading in between before completion then we have to delete file and try again to download. 4 If we try to join channel frequently then it does not open that channel link And many more....
"Alright now here's the problem #1: Telegram keeps saving the pics and gifs and videos i download to the gallery. No matter what I do, it does it even though it doesn't have the permission. #2: New update has that videos Start playing like gifs right after they get downloaded. I don't like that and please make an option to turn off this feature. Tnx"
Many times after restarting the app the theme is changed. I have to manually change it back to my preferred theme. The color scheme is also changed. This has been an issue since last year. Safety concern: it shouldn't message all people who have my number when I joined Telegram. People can abuse this notification to monitor and harass others.
"Been using this app for video chats and usually it's good, but recently it hasn't been working. No one on the video chat can see each other. Even after uninstalling then installing again the camera doesn't work, of course allowing permission for the app to use the camera as well, there's still an issue with the video chats. Please fix this"
"wow!!! how can you take a perfectly working app & just jam it full of unnecessary tweaks & adjusts?? the built-in video preview was perfect & now doesn't functions,when clicked the screen is full of options that don't work & then the app freezes & crash.please fix it, just press & play"
"1) With the latest update I got log outs several times per day. I found a suspicious session but when I re-login I can't terminate it because of security reasons 2) With two-step verification in case you forgot the password, the only option to get back is to reset account (and lose all data). Even when you have access to your phone number and email. They encourage you to set it on but not remind to check recovery email I contact support on twitter and by email but haven't got any response"
"Every thing is good but it can't load existing chats when internet is slow which make difficult to read or view already seen massages. There should be a option for status update like whatsapp & signal, for interacting with people & let me say, people wouldn't switch to your app until you add a feature they are used to with."
"Used it for many years. Still the best overall chat experience with almost too many features. In fact, feature creep is bloating this dangerously. So many gimmicks. Censorship is getting out of hand. I no longer believe it's truly private. Groups definitely aren't and get removed or censored regularly. Something is going on there and it feels...funny. Got Premium but it's not worth the money. No real benefits in real world use."
"Whenever I download a video, it can't be opened. Amd somehow the entire file deletes itself automatically. Even after re-downloading it, the issue persists. I can't watch a single video downloaded on telegram."
My overall messaging experience is good...but the most annoying thing is the notification....the notification doesn't work properly...it's delayed a lot. I want the developer team to fix the issue as soon as possible.
"Loved it always. New update ruined it with bugs and all. Tried to uninstall and reinstall, no use. Same bugs! nothing loads, no attachment goes. Its all ruined. Please fix it to its old quality atleast. Before we decide to stop using our favorite communication platform."
"It doesn't show a timestamp when messages were read, connections for calls to be made are spotty and quality of call is poor, and I don't need to have a list of people whom I don't know on my contacts or be notified when someone random has started to use the app."
Phone calls do not work properly often. When someone calls me through the telegram app I can hear them but they can't hear me and we continuously have to call each other back and forth. There seems to be some kind of connection issue.
"It's been a while since I was using Telegram, but nowadays I can't be able to download properly anything. The issue is that the file stops download mid way and I can't download anything. This happens frequently and I hope so that this issue should be as fast as possible."
"Does the new updated version has the option of delete for everyone...it used to be in old version, which i liked very much. Just to get that option, I uninstalled it installed the app multiple times, but also I am not finding it. My query is already over, but since the review box is asking for 500 words which I fall short off, hence I am doing this.........................................mmm.m............................mm..mmmmmm.......................................... ......................"
"Should give the app a 5 star, but I'm currently having an issue that's being lingering for months now. I was wrongly restricted for spamming when I never did. I applied for a release of my account months ago but got nothing done about it. Please fix this, I can't send messages in groups as long as I'm still restricted."
In the secret chat we cannot send GIFs. When tried so the app crashes. It gives a black screen and app never opens again. Had to uninstall it and reinstall again. Even after the issue is not solved.
"It's a good app overall, however there's a few things that are extremely irritating. First of all, very frequent updates, that do absolutely nothing, but without them you can't open the app anymore. Also, I need to have all the apps on my SD card, but with each of those (-- very unnecessary) updates, the app mysteriously transfers itself back to the internal storage so I have to transfer it back to the SD card at least twice a week."
"The file is not downloading more than one. Improve the app by modifying.Download will be stopped and it won't continue,it causes the mobile data loss and trouble. The download data of half downloaded file will be erased within hours please change it. The half downloaded file should be continue wherever we stopped and whenever we want.please fix it."
Telegram needs to change the swiping gestures... when going back in an android phone it always accidentally affects my chats. Set an option to disable it. Also telegram needs to put the possibility for the users to know if their messages have been delivered. Now you can only understand sent and read.
"Gone buggy suddenly. Selecting notifications doesn't open app. Sometimes no notifications, sometimes you can't change chat, the number off issues is so vast and random I'd swear the app is on its death bed. Never update the if its working."
I was happy using this app untill recently with the new update as soon as I open secret chat room the app hangs and crashes and asks to close the app. I have reinstalled the app in different phone too to check the problem but the issue persists irrespective of the phone I use. I am not able to use telegram because of this.
"I thought at first i was just new to the app, but over 2 months now i have came ta appreciate whatsapp and messenger, how efficient and fast they are in delivering messages and even loading... At times when i open telegram it takes more than 5 minutes to connect and update. I updated the app 2 days ago but still i have the same result 🤔"
"The notification customisation is a mess, one message is a beep, and some mix of message is getting my rington played to me. Can't configure this other than a global mute. Sending some gif will hang the app permanently needing reinstall. please fix."
"Can't watch downloaded videos. Once download complete and open up video, again started downloading from 0. And if completed downloaded video opens up, it will not support. So again downloading the video. Poor experience. Please give solutions."
"When I try to buy Premium, I get an error ""Unfortunately, this feature is not available in your app version"". I have the latest version installed, not a beta one, too."
I would have rated this app 5 star but i was advice to pay the premiums for me to get access to message more of my friend and my business partners so i orded to pay the premiums in A month plan. Here I am I just finish messaging two of my new friend and they said i can't message anyone again. It really hurt me i just think i just wasted my money for the premium so i just wanna let you know i can't text someone anymore...... So i just think i could have text many of my friend and be happy I paid
Not one person is talking about the fact you will receive messages from strangers trying to sell you something or meet up for sex and send you nude pics or scam mail. I thought it was for sending large files. But it's really just a app to meet strangers for hook ups. This app is weird. Nobody even talks about it in the reviews.
I had been using Telegram for over 2 years now. It updated last Wednesday and suddenly I can't open it anymore in any of my devices. I have to say that before that it was just awesome.
"Seems like the messages to the same genders have 2 profiles depending on where we clicked, recent conversation contact shows nothing, but if I open through the contact menu messages appear, also Saved messages should be able to be archived."
Screen share for particular app won't work and most frustrating thing is during the call when I switch between network it takes too much time to reconnect the call sometimes it disconnects automatically.
"Hi Team - The app seems too slow, keeps on loading or updating chats, emojis are not loading and even after sending its not loading. The images and video download/upload time also very slow."
I decided not to download this app. I would like to use telegram but it seems like the permissions at once are very invasive. Reading my call logs? Like how do I know who you're transferring or sharing that data with. And it gets more invasive after that.
"App's calling experience is very bad. Maximum time it is reconnecting with louder sound. For only chat it's fine, but for calling it's the worst app I have ever seen."
"I would give 5 stars but with these problems I can't do that , telegram used to be the greatest messaging app but I think with the latest update it's not anymore. When I'm downloading media, in the middle of that the app's cache deleted and when the downloading finishes, I have to download it again ."
"There is a problem while playing audio , previous song play after end of audio we playing. Like when i play audiobook serial it not play next episode after finish one. It play previously finished episode."
Hi I suggest that even the desktop version should be able to have a download option even in private groups when clicking on as the mobile app and the mobile app like tapping on a link it takes time to get into the link provided not least showing members of the channel and group thanks...
"flaw: When I look into telegram and there are messages that I have not read, and I leave the app, then it still displays the red Android badge on my Android home screen. When I look at my phone in a while again, I will see the red badge on the telegram apps icon as if I had received a new message. This makes me then check messages again ... and again. Whatsapp is better: It displays the red badge only when a new message arrived ON TOP OF THE MESSAGES NOT READ WHEN CHECKING MESSAGES LAST TIME"
"Sometimes during video calls on Android devices, the four emojis meant to guarantee encryption does not get displayed. It happens on both the sides. Does that mean there was a man in the middle attack or the calls were unencrypted?"
"What happen to all the great music selections? At one point, you could type any artist and it would pop up. No longer. However, I've noticed over the weekend the music that I've saved over months ago to present is no longer available. I am very disappointed! I had hand selected my favorite songs and now, I'm left with music songs which really don't interest me. Not a good wide variety available like in the past. Please fix!!"
"Story share option just disappeared from one of my accounts but not the other (on the same phone). Uninstalling and clearing cache did nothing. Posts will randomly be zoomed in when posting, even if they're a perfect square and/or tapped to fit aspect ratio. If multiple slides, anything after the first one could be screwy in any number of ways. Also have not been getting a notification while in-app when I'm sent a message"
"App is in serious need of repair. I can barely post photos without it glitching or cropping something weird. There is literally no point to having all those editing options, because I can not use them!! I do not want to post reels, please please please give some love to the photo editing software. It is deteriorating and ruining the app experience."
I agree with most of the negative reviews. Right now I can't share ANYTHING to my story. Posting multiple photos of different sizes at the same time is a nightmare... IG will just decide to randomly crop whatever it wants. The reels editor / reels remix is a joke and I don't even bother anymore... always freezing or posting with errors after it looked fine in draft. You'd think these would be easy issues to address and they would make them a priority ??? Super frustrating.
"There's literally like 5 different layouts and it's kind of a gamble which one you get. I've got multiple accounts on my phone and they ALL have different layouts and features. Also it's constantly buggy and slow, like when I'm trying to send someone a post and NOTHING shows up. So yeah it's a lot worse of an app than it should be considering how popular it is."
"In the past 6 months my news feed freezes and won't update my feed with those I follow. I've reported this multiple times and I never get a response. I've found a work around to view new posts, but it's frustrating that it won't update automatically on its own. I've done everything to try and fix the problem."
"They removed the date posted from all posts and now only show in terms of how many weeks ago it was. Who the hell thinks about time in terms of how many weeks ago it was? The answer is no one. Put the date back. Using this platform as a journal of sorts to keep track of events and my photos, this change is a huge let down. Might have to find a different platform to use if they keep it this way."
"Editing videos is really hard. The app freezes, doesn't work most of the time. And there are no alternatives. You are not allowed to upload on the browser. A lot of things happen without you getting notified about them beforehand. There are settings for media upload quality, everyone!! Look at those before you post. IG will not post your photos at their original quality, otherwise. For a system that solely focuses on media, it's interesting how troublesome the bare-bones system can be."
"I've noticed on all my devices that all the features they have are either differently labeled, not there, or there are more than they are supposed to be. It makes it more confusing for me to navigate through the app. Originally, my review was 4 stars. Obviously, I lowered it to 2. I still plan on using the app, but I hope every device has the same options to choose from."
I loved that they recently made it so you can see your whole list of collections vertically when you want to save something to a collection. But now it reverted back to the old horizontal way at the bottom of the screen. The old way did and still does cut off half my collections. Please bring back the new way. It was so much better even for a few weeks that it was live.
"Stories are broken again; it seems like every other update and always in a new way. This time - when sharing a post to my story, tapping the picture doesn't show a preview of the post's caption. The picture just bounces but does nothing. Also, when posting a story, I used to be able to press and hold the ""post to story"" option and select a highlight to add to as soon as it posted. Now it just tries to share the story to FB, but I have to go watch my own story and add to a highlight from there."
"More in the last 6-8 months than ever before. I just tried 4 times to upload photos, and they revert back after I adjust them, I can't position them the way I want, and some move to the side and leave a big black space in the square. I've also moved to the next screen to see if they come through okay anyway, and the photos turn sideways and are all warped. It's a bummer."
"Instagram for Android has a lot of features that freeze up a lot. Or that doesn't load properly. Like when you're adding a story, and it doesn't always load all your recent videos and photos. Or when you're doing reels, sometimes it'll freeze or stop loading. Also, when you add music from the Instagram library, it flags you for copyright even though you used the audio from Instagram itself. It's so stupid. These bugs have worsened for consecutive months and need to be addressed."
"I recently switched from a personal to a professional account and have had nothing but issues. It no longer syncs with my Facebook, now I can't share anything to stories- not even my own posts!! I uninstalled/ reinstalled the app and reported the bugs several times. So frustrating when you're trying to grow a business and online presence. I could've just stayed personal and not bother with the metrics features."
"I love it to keep in touch with family across the states, without the drama of a larger platform. But every single time I attempt to log in, I get an ""unexpected error"" message. It is NOT my mobile (Android) connection as it happens while connected to wifi as well. It is ONLY with Instagram. After 6+ frustrating attempts, only then will it let me into my account. Or after I uninstall/reinstall. Now the app keep crashing...."
"It was working just earlier today, just about 5 minutes ago, as of writing this, and ever since I updated the app, it's been kicking me out every time I get into it, I've tried restarting my phone, force stopping the app, and even did a virus check on it and there's nothing wrong, but yet after all of it, it hasn't fixed anything. If you can address this issue or give a tip on how to manually fix it, please do"
"Welp update on Instagram's issues. This time the app crashes when I try to upload and share multiple photos. I don't know why, but I can't even get to the second stage of editing the photos with different filters without the app crashing. The limit used to be 10, idk if it's still is, but I was only able to upload 7. I tried to see if it could handle uploading 7 photos all at once and I had no issues. Still uploading 8 and above even while adding them one by one causes the app the crash."
"Stop putting functions overtop of the pictures. The new ""Browse Related"" button on the bottom left of all posts may be small but it's dark enough to keep you from being able to read text on the image. Not to mention all these buttons on the images take away from the experience of enjoying the image which this whole platform is about. It feels like banner ads at the bottom of YouTube videos and is managing to ruin my experience of the app. Please fix this."
"Something changed and now my photos are skewed. Not sure what happened but when I attempted to post a photo last week and again today, when I move to the filter section the entire photo is stretched out and blurry. It's not a problem with the photo since I can post elsewhere without issue. Please fix. Thanks."
Full of all kinds of bugs lately. Portrait photo going into a landscape multiple photo post stretches and ruins the portrait photo. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times and no success. This was never a problem in the past. Sometimes clicking the next arrow for a post doesn't take you to the next page. Photos while making a post will go all black when trying to move the ordering around. Making posting really time consuming.
"The app itself is fine, however I'm not a fan of what's been done to the explore page. Instead of giving me the option to scroll through things I actually want to see, you force me to look at categories that have nothing to do with my personal interests. It'll switch from explore to motorcycles, to tattoos, to explore, to food, to outfit inspiration. Should have kept the explore tab the way it was instead of the garbage you force down my throat with this update."
I don't understand why the experience on Android is so far below that of iOS. Especially on stories. Why when working with text in a story do I constantly get a color dropper to select the color of the text from somewhere on the screen?? Only occasionally do i get the set of prepared colors to choose from. It's an infuriating experience.
"Used to enjoy. Now they replaced my reels button with the notification button, but forgot to put the reels somewhere else. I can't search for reels and if someone sends me one, I can scroll up through more. What is this garbage? I have to uninstall the app, reinstall, then it'll work until I close the app before it disappears again. Please fix, or at least acknowledge the issue."
"It's been nice having it, but I've been getting annoyed with the dark mode and now I can't turn it off. Every time I click a link, I have to close Instagram just to make it work properly again. On top of that, I've met so many people and want to follow them all, but I'm bugged out where it won't let me. I can't see anything, dark mode can't be turned off after the feature got removed from the settings, all that is really getting annoying. Someone please patch this"
"Lots of ads, auto scroll is incredibly annoying. Also, I can no longer get anything besides reels/videos whenever I scroll down on a post in my Explore. I want to see images in my Explore– if I wanted reels, I would click the reels tab... or get tiktok. Nothing I do to my algorithm works to fix this. PLEASE stop trying to be tiktok. This is an images app, not a videos app."
"Have always loved Instagram for the concept of an image feed, but I feel the interface and mechanics are becoming increasingly terrible. Constantly switching formats, moving stuff around, bugs and errors loading and editing reels/stories/videos, push people I follow that I car about to bottom of feeds, algorithms make it difficult for novice users to get good followings. The overall platform retains it's essence, but it has become more difficult to create content and feel seen as a smaller user"
"I can't multiselect images if they aren't in my camera roll, i.e ""Other..."". Also when I try to reply to someone's story it auto views the next and then I reply to the wrong person and completely lose the story if I can't remember who it was, huge inconvenience. The IG crop parameters are ridiculous, and widely disliked. Why hasn't it been changed? I can't post Portrait images if the zoom is in Landscape and vice versa. 5.2.23"
"Holy majoley the glitchiness of this app is insanity. Takes forever for the reels to load, the music switches to a different song out of nowhere, and unless you have barbie sized fingers, editing a reel has become so difficult!! Needlessly difficult. There is no reason they had to change the editing function. Also the option to speed up reels from camera reel has disappeared. Getting so tired of each update making it worse & worse & worse."
"The app is undeniably a buggy mess, and the fact that almost everyone I know has a completely different version of the app leaves me wondering, why do some people get to have certain features while others left in the dust of potentially fun and interesting features? Plus the addition of reels and the changes in algorithm don't make much sense."
"Too many glitches. If you adjust your photos to crop a certain way before posting it won't matter because they'll post cropped incorrectly. You also can no longer post multiple photos as rectangle instead of square or it'll crop them for you. Also, if you're on the explore page it will automatically scroll to the next post instead of letting you go at your own pace. This app used to be about the pictures but now it's just about advertisement."
"Good content, extremely glitchy. Most of the time I open a link, it'll play the first second and then switch to something else. I have to keep closing the app and trying the link somebody sent me for it to work unless the link is sent within Instagram messages and even then, that glitches out a lot. The search function is abysmal, worthless, if you find something and lose it, you'll never find it again. Considering the resources behind this app and who owns it, it's ridiculous how bad it is."
"Please make a new update, because instagram literally is mostly unusable right now. Every time I try to upload a photo or group of photos, instagram glitches me out and deletes every edit or the pictures I selected right before I post. The reels are super glitchy if you try to make one, its terrible all around. And if you try to make a story and type, it freezes up and force-crashes. I know my phone isn't the problem, I've checked to be sure its running properly and isn't out of space."
"SO SICK AND TIRED!! OF ALL OF THE GLITCHES!!! WITH ANYTHING THAT IS NOT A P P L E ! ! ! Cropping is messed up and will not save, the adjust option is so messed up, the images never save to your phone like they're suppose to and will also upload incorrectly. Cant veiw b4/after now, & God forbid I try to upload and edit 2+ images in 1 post. As soon as some glitches get fixed with the editing, more arise later. And that's only what I can think of off the top of my head. With JUST editing."
"Love insta but as I load my images, it crashes probably every other time. If I put less than 8 photos it is less likely to crash which is frustrating as I'd like to oh the max sometimes. Also sometimes images get loaded half cut off or moved to one side. If I try to fix it, it goes back to the way it was. It seems Apple friends don't have these issues so may just be Samsung bugs that are not being addressed. I tried redownloading and updating and same issues."
"Hey Instagram, how about you stick with one layout and stop changing it back and forth. Before when I saved a reel, i had to manually go to my saved, go to saved reels, and put them each individually in a folder. The last update gave me the option to save the reel to a specific folder, saving me the hassle to go in manually. And now we're back to where we started. The last update was fine. Maybe I'll bring up the rating if y'all stick with the last one."
"I am very disappointed for not being able to copy and paste in this ridiculous App. I've kept this App for keeping my connection. but so far the communication has been time consuming, just because we can't copy and paste to make our communication run faster. The worst 2nd problem is Instagram never allows me to keep my favorite pages and keeps distracting and pushing stuff on me that I don't want to see! it's ridiculous 👎"
This past update has been horrendous. I have a reoccurring bug where a very specific ad will crash my app. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled the app twice and both times it's worked for a day before everything stops working again. I can't even open the app anymore and have to repeat the entire process again.
"Way too many ads, features are taken and given away without any reason. It feels a little invasive at times. It is difficult to find certain statistics. You are saved folders are not a priority. I wish there was a way to disable reels or the explorer page in general. Reporting sometimes does not work. There are fake ads that Instagram allows on there that are there and designed to trick people into purchasing things so Instagram does not verify any of these sales."
"I've had the same bug for MONTHS. It always shows there's a message request in my inbox, when there's no message. To rectify this, I have to go in and delete ALL the messages in my inbox. Often I have to go back to conversations i had YEARS ago to fix it. Then it happens again out of nowhere. I work in tech & when we roll out patches or SW releases we TEST first to ensure that the new configuration WORKS. Update: this is STILL an issue a year later. Update 2: LET ME TURN OFF AUTO SCROLL OMG"
"It's been a minute since I've posted but I'm currently noticing a large number of errors occurring -- the inability to adjust, move and resize photos. Images are skewed and blurry though the photos themselves are not. This appears to be an ongoing issue with others as well."
"This app gets worse and worse. First I couldn't use the tilt shift, which stopped working over a year ago and hasn't been fixed despite multiple reports. Then I had issues when I tried to edit multiple photos on a single post -- each photo would revert to its original dimensions when I tried to adjust one of the other photos. Add onto that the incessant ads, the pushing for video content and reels, and the fixation on competition with TikTok, and frankly it is no wonder I use this app less."
"The explore page is almost impossible to reset or clear. You have to click on each individual post and select that you're not interested in it. Do this over and over hundreds of times, and maybe then you'll get different explore page suggestions. This is frustrating and a waste of time, making the explore page useless. Plus, none of your posts can ever go viral on the app, so what's the point?"
"It's getting worse and worse. Not only it's made it almost impossible to view connect published by people I follow, and it is overwhelmed with ads, but now it's also the whole publishing process is super buggy. Images get shifted around and it takes an extra effort to realign them. Also, now all videos HAVE to be reels. I don't know who's responsible for all these ""improvements,"" but it's making the app worse and worse. Eventually, someone will make another one that will not be so ad invasive."
"A reel that I had worked very hard on was taken down due to ""copyright"" (which, by the way, is not possible as I had taken every photo/video myself and there was no music other than that which instagram itself provides). Wouldn't be such a bummer if it hadn't taken me HOURS to make due to the sheer garbage that is reel editing. Constant freezes, ""something went wrongs,"" and other nonsense make the process infuriating. Troubleshooting didn't fix the issue, either. Bonus: all the ads are 👎"
"Very few of the features ever work for me. I can't make reels 90% of the time and when I can the video quality is terrible. Recently it started doing this thing where I can only edit the first photo in a carousel as well. Won't let me trim videos in app, it just crashes or doesn't do it. I have to put videos together in another editing app to make a reel. Super annoying. I used to love Instagram."
The feed shows more and more reals from people that I don't follow. What is the point of following people if it ends up showing whatever the algorithm finds best? It would be great to have the option to switch between showing content of people you follow and what the algorithm suggests. Furthermore it seems there is a bug when trying to post multiple photos in a single feed. If you select one of the multiple fotos and you chop it (or move it) then it applies the change to all of the pictures.
"Instagram is a nice social media platform, but unfortunately with a bunch of bugs still being unchanged. First, I should mention that there is always a story icon of a user when one deletes that story. It seems like there's something to watch there but the gray screen with unavailable story shown up, which is really annoying. And it only disappears after 24 hours. Then, the chatting part is a bit complicated to use, while sharing media. Hope to the proper solution as fast as possible."
"A very glitchy mess when you want to do anything related to posting. One such bug resulted in me needing to completely uninstall the app. All of these bugs have been around for years, yet all they do is UI changes, which actually make the experience more annoying, adding more menus and button inputs in order to reach the same thing."
"They lose another point for phantom new story red rings. This was an issue before, but not for quite a while, only within the past few weeks. Update: that seems to have gone away for now, but an even worse issue has come up: whenever you go to leave a comment on someone's story, if you're not fast enough, it's still scrolling through stories in the background as you're typing away, so you could easily wind up sending your message to a completely different person or an ad or whatever."
"2 things... 1. Up until now I have sent multiple photos and videos in one shot and view them without difficulty, and now I can't click on them and it causes me to accidentally like the message when I don't want to, and I can't un-like it like I used to. 2. Why are the dates of when people put their posts up not showing up anymore? It's counting by weeks (i.e., 195 weeks ago)?! Please change it back!!!!! Was there an update I didn't know about? What is going on?!?! Please fix these issues!!!!!"
"Instagram please, fix this app. It brings a lot of problems. It doesn't even loads the images . Since yesterday, I just uninstalled this app and then suddenly it brought a problem. It just started refusing to load the images and doesn't work properly. Not just that, it also Won't respond to anything even if I log out or do something else it still brings bug problem. Please, fix this app, right now."
"I enjoy using Instagram, but just lately whenever I'm trying to do a reel I get 'something went wrong. Please try again'. It will repeat a portion of the reel during playback when I'm trying to check it before posting, and doesn't work as smoothly as it did. It also uploaded and posted a reel with the text the right way up, but the reel was turned upside down, which it wasn't before uploading. Had to completely restart and it took me ages. Getting annoyed with it."
"Please add the date back for posts! I liked being able to scroll back through my photos to see when they were taken. Showing the number of 'weeks ago' a photo was posted is such a pointless change. Additionally a recent posts filter on hashtags would be nice to have back, posts are so much less discoverable now since the change was made to show only the top or top recent posts. There have been too many changes to Instagram over recent years, please at least bring back these basic features."
This recent update made all of the medias I sent to my friend through DM disappeared. And it's not like I deleted all of them. I sometimes send media (reels / photos) to my friend so I can view it faster than going through saved. But now why did all of them disappear led without a trace? Please fix it. Now it's getting annoying to scroll all the way up to find the media I sent. This update is causing more problems than good.
"Last year end until recently, when, particularly when creating a post of multiple shots, any position adjustment (even sometimes without) is not saved, or the image is skewed and there's a black/blank margin to the side, or, when tilted, it is just skewed at an angle in the frame. It's incredibly annoying and had been an issue for the last few weeks. Please hurry up and fix. Never been an issue before."
"It's ok overall but Instagram notes are still not popping up for some people in my region even though it has been released as a feature and we have updated it to the latest version. It is pretty annoying since we can't see what's up with other people that have the feature. Also, whenever I uninstall and reinstall it downgrades. Which is also quite frustrating."
"When you upload multiple photos in an album, it crops the photos in a wrong way when you use the ""Rotation/Perspective/Zoom"" tool. The end result is that the photos in the album appear badly edited and with weird white frames. This has been a problem since about a year ago with Samsung devices. I have been sending my photos to my iPhone (a phone I don't really use) only to edit them and upload them when I need to upload an album."
"Since the new update, the problem is Story. When I use the filter or music on my story. The picture got blurry and not cleared. Also, I put my story with the music on my highlight. A few weeks later, when I try to watch my highlight that has music on it...the music cannot be heard anymore."
"I like using the app but my god is uploading photos a pain in the arse. The sizing is difficult, it always cuts off parts. And when uploading more than one I almost always get a black line down the side of one or more of the photos which is very annoying and doesn't seem fixable. It freezes and fails if youve been editing a while. For an app that is predominantly for photo uploads you'd think that aspect of it would be the most important to work in from a functionality perspective. Sort it out!"
"This never happen before, but whenever I try to see my own highlights or my friend's, it keeps restarting back to the first image in the highlight and I can't see other images in the highlight. So annoying, I was gonna check if my highlight was okay and might remove some images I've added in the highlight, but I can't check because of this. Please fix it, thanks."
"This app is so broken, it's impossible to upload stuff normally. I have a connected fb account and the feature to post on both platforms at the same time doesn't work. I press on it and it loads for ever. The drafts sometimes delete themselves. If an upload fails, you can't copy the text you've written, you have to delete it and start from scratch. You can't rename your audio on posts, again it just loads for ever. Please for the love of god. Fix this. 2 stars only because regular use is fine."
"Android 12. OnePlus 7 Pro. Dark mode issues with the blacks turning white and things becoming unreadable. The only fix is to restart the app. Quality issues with uploading videos with music, the video loses quality and makes writing and pictures a little blurry. Sometimes my own comment doesn't load when trying to reply. My camera is freezing on the regular on IG, I press to capture the moment, and the entire camera system freezes, many special moments have been lost because of that."
This would have been a better app if all those glitches are cleared and made this app bug free. Some messages are cannot be seen even after it is delivered and I couldn't zoom the profile picture. There are more and more bugs that I couldn't list all out. Some features are available for some users and not for others. Hope those bug would be cleared at the earliest.
"For some reason I no longer have the option to share anything on my stories just from the reels I was watching. It only let's me send it to a friend in dms. If I want to add a post on my story, it had to be an original post that I made, like taking a picture. Otherwise, there's no option anymore to reshape reels or videos on stories anymore."
"I used to be an active Instagram user. Suddenly I couldn't post multiple pictures. After editing photos they rotated in a weird way. I tried numerous times, even uninstalled the app, but result was the same. I reported the problem, but it hasn't been fixed. Later I couldn't even post a single picture. When I scale or rotate it, it appears with white area on the side. Four months later I tried again and it's still the same! Uninstalling didn't help. Is it really hard to fix?"
"The app recently started to become really buggy. ""Something went wrong"" when saving pictures in drafts is a pain. Especially when trying to post on to my stories and it just has the buffer icon and doesn't post! Please fix it! I'm crying internally over these bugs that don't let me post subliminal messages on my story.."
"Awful. I don't know what happened but I'm always experiencing problems with this app now. I used to be able to put captions on my reels with HashTags, but for some reason when I post the reel the caption just vanishes. Its ridiculous, I spent like 10 minutes writing something and it's all gone. Oh and for some reason when I post a story, a black box covers the entire screen and I have to restart the app to fix it. Oh and I hate how I need to post reels to get actual good engagement."
"Have lost access to reels. Reinstalled a few times, the reels button is visible only the first time I'm in the app. When i touch it, it goes on to a blank screen, doesn't show anything. Once i close the app and reopen, the reels button is replaced with the likes / heart button. I'm only able to access the reels in my feed, and even there i cant scroll to see the next one. No idea what's going on."
"Oh my gosh, stop moving the buttons around. I can't find anything because everything keeps moving. And fix dark mode. It keeps changing to this weird mode that's half light and half dark whenever you use a link, and it makes it hard to see words. The only way to fix this is by trun dark mode off and back on again or to set it to system default, but my phone isn't in dark mode because I can't use dark mode if I'm using a theme."
"App is getting more bugged as time goes on. At the point where they pile up and it's becoming basically un-usable. A list of issues I have include: Cant upload due to a real being frozen in mid upload even after trying to upload for 2 days with solid wifi (also meaning I can't switch or log out of my account) Cant cancel uploading process App is generally slow (reels and editing especially) Can't send bug reports in app because ""request fails to send) And more that I don't have space to write..."
"Glitches in personal chat. I receive notifications for new messages but I have to manually refresh the chats to see the messages itself. The chat shows that some messages are sent twice, especially website links but when I refresh or restart the app its fixed. Sometimes it creates confusion as I unsend the duplicate message but when I refresh or restart the app the original message is gone as well."
"Lately, it feels like Meta is trying to drive away customers (which isn't a bad thing for democracy but is a bad thing from a business perspective). I've hated most changes for a while, but the one that's prompted me to write a review is the automatic scrolling of picture collections. As far as I can tell, there's no way to turn off that feature, and it's so unbelievably irritating."
"What's happening with the ""adjust"" tool? I try to either adjust sizing or move the picture within frame and it doesn't save the changes when posted. Sometimes the picture is off frame that there's a rectangle on the side. Not sure what y'all did, but it's very buggy and I've been refraining from saying anything because I figured you would fix it, but months later, it's still the same. So, please fix."
"1. Lot of bugs are always in bugging my way whenever I need a quick access about something. 2. Very very distractive , triggers your mind to recheck in every hour. 3. Quality of photos and videos get blurred when on data saving mode and without it sucks your data. 4. When you are not in the mood of watching things acc. to your interest still it' ll be showing related videos and posts."
"Biased against Android : did not give the updates to Android - also, takes too long to send messages now -AND now won't let me add account, it's just a black screen. - update a week later, still a black screen. Instagram, get better. STILL. Won't work. I used to use this app every day. Im disappointed. FIX THIS. RN. Update: they finally fixed it. Only took 4-5 months. 3 stars because they took literally so long and had many bad reviews from this same issue. UPDATE: 5 months later. MANY issues."
"Stopping Reels. Evertime i enjoyed some random reels, and accidentally connect to other wifi or data, the reels are stopped. I always mad when i saw an interesting reel but cant watch it till finish. Have to reopen the app without knowing that i can find the same reel. Pls fix that sudden stopped reel when changing data to wifi or reverse. Thats super annoying."
"The biggest game in town, but sooo buggy. The FB/Insta/meta team would do well to take a year and answer to all the bugs and crashes and cropping and stretching errors. Customer service does not exist. Meta/Insta/FB only wants to knock down the competition to the same ameteur level as Insta, rather than build themselves into something better. I hope they learn what people really care about and change, but I'm not holding my breath."
"Engagement on Instagram has fallen so hard over the years. They want you to upload reels in order to be seen, but when you try to upload a reel it doesn't work, either it posts to drafts instead of public, or the text you placed dissapears, or the music you added goes to 100% volume despite turning it down. If you want us to use specific features on your app, maybe make them functional? Then there's the issue of thousands of spam/bot accounts that comment on all of the photos you post. Over it."
"i have been using instagram for years and have been posting pictures from my trips. im not sure why but for some reason instagram will distort my images into pixelated, glitchy looking versions of the original. i will post, it looks normal, i close the app, and when i come back they've been ruined? very annoying to have to deal with and delete posts because there doesnt seem to be a fix."
"I'm tired of seeing an ad first every single time I open the app. I want to see the people I follow, not ads. Hate new photo sharing format in chats. Annoying how it's displayed as a cluster when sending more than 1 at a time. Also will not let me click to view all the photos. Won't expand them."
"App works OK, but far too many suggested reels and sponsored posts trying to load when I check my feed. This applies to mobile and desktop versions. Some parts of the world don't have superfast unlimited Internet, especially in rural areas, so an option to turn off autoplaying videos would be a big improvement."
I'm not sure only me facing this. But very inconvenient to post a reel with an audio or songs because the next day the song will be gone. So not sure if the reel feature in Instagram is not effective anymore. What is the purpose of reel in Instagram if the songs can disappear in 1 or 2 days after posting? Hope this app can become better for future.
"The notifications are totally busted. For some reason I get notifications way later than I should, most times after I've already seen the message I am being notified about. I'd rather not have to open the app every five minutes, especially since it's not exactly known for its low battery and data usage. This problem sometimes gets fixed and then just reappears again. Also it seems there's problems with the dark mode partly switching to light mode and looking really strange."
"The notifications are always late😭 I've experienced this multiple times before but it got even worse. Not to mention the fact that whenever I log on my second acc, I scroll only for a few seconds and I see the + button already. I have to exit the app multiple times before it went back to normal. I don't even have a problem with the wifi connection smh"
"IG is okay at best. Photo and video functions are fine. Attaching images are bad, they get pixelated due to compression. The worst part is, that some basic chat functions are missing. Like the reply option, or adding different reactions and such. Updates aren't doing anything, and support isn't responding either."
"performance wise the app is fine. my whole issue is this stupid reels function they are pushing incredibly hard that absolutely blows compared to TikTok. I can't pause a reel only mute, u can't rewind, fast forward or even restart a reel & overall they are just awful in comparison to TikTok. just frustrating to use especially when I run into a reel I'm genuinely interested in watching & I end up fighting with the app to do anything that makes any sense.."
"Look this app is a decent social media app but I've had bugs viewing reels on my account for over 3 months and it still isn't fixed. I've logged out, uninstalled the app, reported the problems and it's honestly quite annoying. I've also had lots of bugs editing and posting reels which requires way more working around than I should have to deal with from a quality app. If you don't mind bugs and are really in it for the pictures which is what the app used to be about you'll most likely enjoy it."
"So I've noticed for the past week or so that if I boost a reel with my own music (I'm singing in the reel) it looses it's audio IF I boost it... And then I went to see my old reels that I've boosted in the past and it has the same issue. So when I pressed ""delete ad"" on all those reels only then the audio returned .... Why is this?And now I've just seen that some of my older reels don't actually play ... They are frozen ..  Could you help me with both these issues please?"
this app is very stable and I do enjoy and use insta more than other socials but I'm giving it a 2/5 because there are some things that make the app hard to use. It would be nice if it were easier to be able to find a specific post or reel. It should also be easier to post more than one photo or add gifs saved from your gallery at a time in a single story. Makes it feel really frustrating and inconvinient when trying to post. I hope better features for instagram stories like this will happen.
"I'm getting pretty frustrated with the pictures in posts getting cropped automatically and adding a black stipe down the side, and it doesn't matter how many times I fix it, it just reverts back. I also don't like that you can't crop clips for stories anymore, quite inconvenient. Some insight would be appreciated please."
Disappointed with how photos are editing. I keep losing the position of my photos and the edits are not as I make them when they post. After they have posted I have lost a percentage of the pictures. I've tried to update and now using a brand new phone and still having the same issues. I am also Disappointed with the fact that I can not speak to someone from instagram to help correct this.
"Quite a staggering amount of spam (bots) and ads. The UI for creating multi-image posts, stories or reels is in some key aspects very unintuitive or unusable. For example, posting a video longer than the default reel length requires me to first tap ""trim"" to acutally un-trim the video that would have been silently cut down to 60 or 30 seconds by default. In multi-image posts different aspect ratios are a pain."
"Something wrong with the audio explore pages, while watching reels audio page, moving to reels after the 2nd or 3rd row, they just show it as stuck reel and doesn't play or show any like, comment, share counts. And also many times the hashtags gets removed itself when posting a post or a reel. Please look into this, new update didn't fix it."
"My app has refused to update. I've manually updated this app seven times now, on playstore. Nothing changed, and when I come here again, it shows that my app needs an update. I can't tag my messages to reply them, I can't react to messages, and I can't see what I'm typing because my keyboard blocks it. I've sent bug reports twice now, but there's still no change. It also restarts a lot wbenm I use it. It's frustrating."
This app is getting on my last nerves! Bug after glitch after bug! I'm now trying to go on my draft reels and edit them. All audios that was saved to them are now lost. Trying to put the audio on again and it brings me out of editing and back to the draft reel video selection. It's honestly soo annoying. I've just updated. And been prompted to clear cache. No change at all!
"The app is constantly changing without any warning and ar the moment, I'm struggling to post anything AT ALL in my stories because it just says ""posting"" with a grey screen and when I close the app and come back, it's just been completely deleted. I have been dealing with this for 2 weeks now, and I can very rarely post in my story because of it. I don't understand why since I've un and reinstalled Instagram multiple times. It's really making me feel like leaving the app completely."
"I love this app, but recently it has changed so much it's saturating the animation when I like a message is an unnecessary change and it just doesn't fit, if I'm trying to have a quick conversation it distracts me too much also it has been kicking me out of my main account for no reason? it says the owner may have changed the password but that's not true, and I already closed every other session to prevent a hack or something and it still does the same thing. please fix this things thx"
"I used to enjoy uploading vlogs and song covers on the old IGTV and reels (usually around 2 min videos) but now with the time limit, I can't post videos in the length I'd like for it to be... Like not even over a minute, really??? Also, editing pictures before posting it, well... It keeps glitching. It uncrops, some colour tweaks undo themselves, drafts don't save the edited version of the pic etc."
The simple fact that they took away the music feature for stories single handley ruined one of the most used thing ever. If by any chance you have a story with lyrics placed in a highlight it will be removed. If you have a story with just the song it will no longer work. This makes it so frustrating. Please for God's sake give us back music !!
"I enjoy being a creator on it, but the audio glitches, the reel filming glitches, and the need to redownload it every few months to try get rid of them are so frustrating. Sometimes, the app will delete hours' worth of work, and I lose all the time and products put into my work."
Stupid developers don't solve problems but increase problems. Now video call is stucking. during Random match we can't quickly disconnect calls that we don't want so free cards goes to used up. It automatically reconnect to others after disconnecting calls and you can't quickly leave it so charges diamonds.
"there doesn't seem to be a way to determine if somebody is in the same state or city as you. there are lots of messaging coming in, but the only location verification is by country. That's not really a whole lot of help. It seems like this app is only made for chatting and flirting, but will never resort to actually meeting someone in person and being with them. That's a huge disappointment and kind of a waste of time."
"Previously free calls were allowed to any user, doesn't matter the level of the user.If you are having more than 3 cards you are good to go..But after the new update it doesn't allow anymore. It totally depends on the user level to make a free call ."
"It seems this apps even you have good wifi connection the pictures can't seen, addition to this weak connection of video calls lag can't connect well, i want to advice don't put many articulating while getting the gcash money so much pain to withdraw"
Payment problems everytime I purchase diamonds and as I purchased twice and contacted customer service they said to wait but still after the didn't receive and so I texted them seems like they went offline.(other than that i don't think I have any other issues.)
My backpack option is worst please .my task option is good but not show my daily task. Last 4 and 5 updates are very bad. Countrywide search is not good I'm search country but showing aal country persons. And random match all person are phillipines. Please update new version and india .Pakistan and Bangladesh search well please
Many fake accounts showing phone recordings in live. Don't accepting task completion after complete specially party live. Can't connect with chamet customer care service...
This was Good app before 1 month but now it's Very bad app...You can't even find best matches for free call ....if your level is high then you can call others you can't even see user live ..please fix this problem...and Lets call everyone to even higher rating girl..
Today's after the latest update i see duplicates in following list. The lazy loading there sucks too...what did u guys do...how hard is to get a list correctly without messing it up
"The app uses a bot for customer services,there is no real life customer support so don't expect issues to get sorted out ."
The 300 diamonds received by watching ads that function removed in new update. Should be started again.
This app has potential it's very annoying when the app give you free calling cards sometimes it does private calls but most of the time you get a random match call why not have a option where you can have the option to choose private or quick match
Car games list .not massage to list in gamers so baad upadate.please solve this problem
App need high data speed internet mostly e drop in party even not open app well. There should be low ata require app through we can easily stay anywhere in party or on chamet
I am giving this stars coz I have recharged for rewards They promise me for free calls and many other things But still now There is no any free call and all And second thing is that there no customer service number or contact where we can direct contact with them
"App is good but payment system is not good,, i recharge for 45000 diamonds but didn't get yet ,, i contact chamet support, they just tell me for patients for 2 days , what happened???"
"Man the app is all great and all but recently my friends and me are facing some trouble while calling. Even tho we have diamonds or we recharge we can not get the free card ! I'm lv3 and it says to get the free card i need to be at lv 9 ,??? Why tho This unexpected problem has taken the good experience for us . We kindly ask to resolve this and if possible try removing the lvl lock for calling , because the free call helps us to know weather the person is worth talking or not. Regards"
"Very bad experience, all time i lose my money playing game, monday i lose 24 lak in 40 min then i recharge 3000 thousand still now i lose money, my id is 15216177, allways i recharge here. Not tip winning Thanks chamet"
"The app is cool but no more call, just the random calls"
Most of the time lost my coins due to poor connection of call receiver and also some time call not go shows busy but she is on live
amount of this kinds of apps I can this is the best but the calling price is too cost and when calling it is too fast of going deduction again so if you could make it some adjustment it will be more popular because everyones even the poor can use it
"I can watch youtube 1080p 60fps without buffer yet i chamet always says ""there are no signal,try again later"".seriously braah"
Why you guys removed the translation part in live section becomes difficult to translate the msgs. Also there are many fake profiles are there people already played prercorded video in live stream
You really need to work on your network the network is so poor compare to other apps
Why i can't download chamet app on my iPhone but i can download on android in the same country. Even I can't change the region in the chamet app
"It's a great App. My thought was that the Apps pays people. It's thursday already and I haven't received my payment to my wallet, I kept going back and forth to check but no damn money in my wallet. I'm deleting this App asap unless you pay me."
Great app. But the scores for each profile should be removed for paying customers. The Only people who should have a score on there profile are the people who have payouts linked.
Glitch after an update I dint have my task shiwn after i updated..... Please chamet fix thus problem .. thank you 💓💗
"chamet, just return the call, it's hard for us to call others, we have calls, we don't even have viewers, we're awake every day, thenchamet, just return the call, it's hard for us to call others, we have calls, we don't even have viewers, we're awake every day, then there's no caller there's no caller 🥲🥲🥲🥲"
There should be a way to view the price of the hostessbefore you call I go in blind only to realize that I will be charged 10k diamonds post the free minute card as that cards hides the price fix this to make a better experience for the caller . Or put in an option as to when the caller wants to enable free cards they can
I've a bad experience using this app.. I send gifts to my friends & in return chamet send me gifts(diamond) but they didn't credited in my account.. I contact the chamet support but they never reply
"Stoppeed working in Ld emulator on pc,, aallsso trriiedd oothher emulator like memu, my coinnss aare waasasssted too now, bad experiencee!"
"2 star because I'm suspended from receiving beans after making calls, and choosing a payment method is another type of headache."
chamet always decrease my level..if I am doing hard work they never support.they dropp back me too 0level. and I am unable to reach boys because of that...it effects my weekly earning a lot...
Can't live stream although I reached to level3.
"Not loading even though the network is very fast. And recharge amount is credited very lately every time,I missed recharge diamonds also once. Video call is buffering from so many days"
"I love the app and would like to say that this app is amazing, compare to other dating apps...i have spent too much and now cant afford!! 2 stars because the cost is too high i recommend the chamet team to introduce monthly or yearly subscription!!! Either to reduce the price for buying coins or to reduce the call rates!!! Only rich people can afford so high cost but the rest others cant, if you like everyone to use it den please introduce good pricing i would be glad and love to give 5 stars!!"
App is good but it is very very expensive it 500 diamonds for 1 min diamonds should give low price than it becomes good app
Random match takes very longtime. Always network and bug issues. No option to search a user. Binding problem and also task don't show completed after completion. No better service of chamet team.
I love what's going on here and if u have not join common in and have real fun
I didn't received coin after recharge of Rs. 350. ...and even I am complaining in feedback ....no one is responding...please resolve my query
"I will give it 2 star now, because I always banned! 2 days of 12 hrs banned is ok, but seeing another host that most vulgarity on me is not ok! Why they're not banning? Because it have a big earnings! That's the fact! And besides there's so many changes the tip? The party and what so ever! And also the complain in help center is not helpful 😂 so funny"
Please remove the yellow line policy... its annoying whenever a caller calls you cant receive beans... waste of Mb.. it says... you have chatted < 1 continuously...the bonus is suspended !!!
"i rate this app is only 2 star.bcos i using this app.i very hassle...why you so strictly so many people in this app..why banned, suspended why.the olamet apps is very nice.olamet is no strictly"
At first I do enjoy this app it is a good part time job if your look too but when the day goes by using this makes me irritated I received alot of calls but they are all connecting I check my signal and its all stable I dont know whats the problem but even my dear caller are so disappointed with the system you have everyday I had approximately 50 calls that turns to cancel because of the system problem and some of the call 3 to 4 times but still cant contact me. I hope for your action.
This app motive is to earn money from public. First you will have few seconds of trial call. After that you have to top up based on the requirements. Nothing is free than message. If you send message it won't work. They will tell you to call because they have to earn based on the call. This app will record your audio and video which is also not safe.
Latest update is very bed very slow upload games result thats very bed
great but girl friendly app....only girl get advantage I think👍

"This app is really profitable but i have some issues on using it specially when the caller started to call then suddenly the call stopped without reason or sometimes, param parse fail. I don't know if this is a bug or something. Kindly fixed it."
The app is legit but Can't withdraw because the new payment method arripay cant bind gcash always saved failed my gosh. Please don something about this
average app but totally paid u can't video call without coins
so it is not good because most of users are self oriented profit and earning method and u have not any chances to meet offline and offline dating so app is well but user is worst
all that good ND use sharply it's a fresh app for get more friends ND talk to any one who know u don't know but some time short term special cases for enjoy full fun show sweet loveable ND heart that's all its good ND easy to use
In 500 diamond matching there are fake peoples. Also it fools in many other way to negate the learned diamonds. The cars which r determined to win they r making it lose. What a programming!
It is a good but parches a coin is very difficult and not doing parches by sim money
When I m video call... I can't see the other people.. It's blur and not clear please fix this....
Very bad network from my side and I can't use my free trail my 5 trail is waiste.
I done my recharge but my coin is not added in my account.
"My payment has been done, but i didn't received coins."
"Actually in the begining I was quite satisfied with the app, but day after day in app charges are increasing. Cost of the diamonds stay constant, but random chat diamond charges have suddenly increased from 200 to 500 and time has been reduced from 3 minutes to 1minute. As a result of these aap usage is becoming costly day by day. I am really unhappy with these. And one more problem I am facing is there is no proper help and service option where we can properly explain the in app problems."
Having issue with the application. Not working properly and there is no customer support. Concept of this application is good. But not sure why they are not able to make it to in a proper way. Developer team Need to improve more on application side. And the support team also not good
My dear . First chamet good app now not good .but first i open chamet id .coming otp .but now not coming otp from chamet .
I give two star as I like the part where people get free diamond through lucky gifts also I didn't face any recharge issue as i recharged 4 times and I received all. But the main issue is the sexual and nude content. Although sexual content is banned in live sessions but almost all private calls or random calls ladies are giving sexual entertainment just to get more calls and increase their earning. Private calls should also be screened.
There is no search option with usernames or names. It asks id numbers. Which is not useful to find someone. Please allow search with names
Great apps. But i have experiencing technical error in call. The call automatically ended in 30sec. And it happened many times. Im paying diamonds every minutes. Fixed it immediately i dont want spend my diamonds for nothing. suggestion if possible put it back the free diamonds after we top up all prices.
I love this app! But im having a trouble since yesterday feel so bad. Everytime i go to live broadcast for ramdom match i got warnings without any reasons yesterday i got punished for 1 day then lift this afternoon but then again your system punished my account again for all functions without any reasons. Please help me and fix this.

"Chamet keeps updating itself to ensure maximum profit from the callers, earlier we had an option to call people depending on their call prices they had set from 2k to 20k per minute. But that option was visible everytime you visit a profile, now chamet has removed the call price window, which means you'll end up calling someone with a price tag of 20k per min. Worst thing is, the moment you get connected, you're charged. 150000 diamonds cost 2650 INR as of now."
Im not satisfied. Evertime I call someone it takes a lot of time to connect and then the video buffers alot.. I have spent a lot of money on diamonds but still the video buffers and I am not able to talk to someone properly
I am facing error while recharging. I recharged 2650 and 270 pack but it showed error connection problem. My money has been deducted from my google pay store account. Please help me to refund the money or get the diamonds in my account. I can provide you the details of the order.
It's mostly hookers online..A bit buggy and the cost of talking is very high..I still give it 2 star because they give two or three free matches and it's exciting but the other person hardly talk back.You can say it's a safe app for booty calling to random hookers.If that's your thing.
it's a fake app it's tells us that it doesn't take any charges but when you download it and open the app it will start asking you the payment and even in advertising they tell us that it's absolutely free my foot it's so fake really I am very disappoint i pray that this aap may get block by Google or Play Store
I have 12 cards and the loading time is 383th and It takes forever to meet one person! I was going to buy more cards but of the loading times aren't fixed I'm not sure I'm going to keep this app
"as a host we want many callers to call us.. last month this app was so satisfiying and there's so many caller's and free call to come and we earn a lot, but this month ago the caller and gifter was so rare😭and there's so many high level coming to my broad but now im unsatisfied in this app.. plsss fix this problem. if this thing go far no more in this app go far as a host😪"
Application is too Good but i am giving two stars because of aaripay payment method. It's stuck always. I cant verify my details because arripay not allowing sms verification. I vant withdraw my earnings. I suggested that fix this issues or older method is too good.
The app was working fine until recently...but for some reason now I'm not able to top up my balance. I'm not sure what the reason is for this and every time I contact the support my message is ignored.
"After all the updates you did, the app became more lagging. Almost all calls did not connect. How can we earn? Its not only happening to me but to all my co talents as well. Also, please lower the data consumed by your app. Binding Payoneer is also a burden to all. We earned little but you earned millions or billions, make it worthy to us. Thanks."
The app is lagging too much... Earlier it was working very good 5* rating. But day to day update making it lag. please resolve the issue as soon as possible. Thank You
"This app has some dirty guys. Kindly do something about it. Make it more girl friendly and not porn friendly app. Make sections for makeup, beauty, fashion and astrology. Make it decent for girls. Otherwise, I'm uninstalling it."
"Overall the application is fine but very poor customer support system...i have recharged twice and the payment was successful,But it didn't reflect in the chamet account. I haven't got any diamonds till now.. stucked almost around 372 rupees..still no response"
"I've been learning on this app for years however the new formating is severely disappointing. The reason the old system worked was because it wasn't too challenging, you would have just a few things to learn, you could master it and the lesson would break after a while, forcing you to review and relearn basics. Now the lessons are exhausting , it's not fun and much to infuriating to be educational with the abundance of crammed in words to memorize. I will continue to use it in hopes they change."
"I used this a lot during the pandemic and then went back to using it again. Due to my budget I can't pay for this so I am using the free version. As I get further advanced, I spend more time earning hearts and watching ads then I do actually learning. It drains the battery on my phone and is very frustrating. Don't they make enough money from the people who pay for the app. I don't mind watching a few ads but losing hearts and earning them on top of it is very annoying. Almost ready to quit"
"The new layout feels like a huge step backwards. It was nice to be able to easily repeat topics in the old format. With the new single path it's much harder to find topics you'd like to review. Having stories in the path is fine, but bring back the stories tab. It was nice to take a break from the normal lessons with a few stories. Can't really do that anymore. They've recently updated the app and the format is even worse. It's completely unitive to try and review old content."
"I want to like it, I really do. But you spend more time fighting with the app, waiting for the loading screens, ads, hearts etc than actually learning. That said, it is useful, after finishing 60% of the course I do feel confident in assembling simple sentences in a language I'm trying to learn, but the app is just incredibly frustrating to use."
"It's always one step forward, two steps back with these updates. They redid the interface, just when it started to feel good again. Now it's a mess. Pros: - Stories are mixed in with the lessons, which can be nice. Cons: - When you start a new language, you're assigned stories before you've learned enough words, which is miserable - Every lesson is on one long path, terrible for scrolling back to practice lessons - Old lessons no longer ""crack"" over time to show what you need to review"
"Very unhappy. The new layout has taken away my choice in learning, as now there is only 1 path. I can't just go read a story or easily decide which concept I want to review anymore - very difficult 2 find. Very discouraging. I often forget the material I learned many months ago, but don't know which lesson would be most helpful to review. Please consider bringing back the ""lesson breaking"" feature. Also, please add variety to the monthly badges. Very boring now, all about quests & nothing else"
"Ok so I still really like the app and it's fun to a point. There are a few things that I don't like about it now. I can't go back to specific lessons like I could before to review. Sure there's a part that goes over prev lessons but it's limited,imo. Also, I can't do any of the speaking lessons bc it always says error and goes back to the other page after trying to load for about a minute. I would love to be able to work on my pronunciations. If that can get fixed I'll change my review"
"SO DISAPPOINTED. Duolingo used to be fun and effective and I loved it. Since they changed the format (last winter), though, it really stinks. My learning has screeched to a halt (I had been progressing steadily before). I've been stuck on the same exact 2 concepts ever since the change and can't pass the review section despite many tries. Worse still, I rather dread the daily lessons rather than think of the as relaxing fun. I wish they'd go back to the great product they used to have."
"The leaderboards are majorly messed up and defective. For three weeks in a row now, I've either been demoted when I shouldn't have, or wasn't promoted when I should have. I have been constantly refreshing as the timer counted down to make sure of what my place was, even closing and reopening the app, but once the time is over, it's as if it's completely random what place I end up with."
"Duolingo used to be a highly effective app, but unfortunately, recent updates, most of which seem to be geared more toward fun than learning, have made it frustrating to use. I completed the Japanese course and wanted to use Duolingo for review, but numerous times, I have gone into the app only to find it's been completely overhauled, and my progress in completing review challenges has been, for all intents and purposes, lost. I want my old Duolingo back!"
"It's okay...Kind of wish it would include grammar and local conversation lessons like it used to. It's really frustrating because lessons will give me 2 versions of ""and"" for answer choices with no clear explanation as to which I'm supposed to use. I'm just supposed to guess and hope I'm right so I don't have to pay money to continue. Also, can't get the app to recognize my microphone so I can't do the speaking exercises. Heard I'd have to enable Google which is absolutely not happening."
Makes learning more like a game and can be fun but it keeps changing formats which is very annoying and takes away from some of the fun and feelings of progress. It makes it very hard to map your learning. The streak tracjer does make it easier to practice for at least a couple mins a day.
"The Japanese grammar is often incorrect, forums have been closed, flagging the question does nothing, and the questions remain incorrect for years. There is little or no explanation of grammar or syntax, and the changes to the progression tree make the content of a lesson random rather than focused. This app has become rather useless for learning certain languages, and the only reason it gets a second star is because the free version is inclusive for people who have no options."
"So many bugs with the new update. If you have a free account, you rely on the times when you can practice without running out of hearts/lives. The bugs ""forget"" that you've gotten an award for double points or unlimited hearts/lives. On free accounts, everything has to be precise, but on paid accounts, typos and vernacular are ok. Sometimes it forgets that I practiced and then I don't get my daily credit (daily practice is a big deal on this app. Miss a day and you lose rewards)."
"it would be nice if there were flash cards or something. Without having someone to practice with, it is very difficult to keep up. I chose to pay for the year and was a bit dishearted to see that i couldn't make my own list of words to work on. Otherwise my 2 star rating is due to the lack of vocabulary review. It's frustrating to start a new unit and suddenly having words thrown at you is a bit much. I'm shocked this company is traded publicly and still so generic. Wasted potential."
"I have been using this app to learn French every day for over 3 years. The developers fix things that weren't broken and don't fix things that are. The Tips, which were all the didactic learning you actually get, disappear in the more difficult lessons. A continuing frustration is that they force me to tap on word tiles instead of being able to type in or speak the translations. My eyesight makes word tiles very difficult to use. I make mistakes that I would never make speaking."
"Used to be good, now this app is barely helpful. I used to actually pay for this app. Changes over the last 2-3 years are aggravating, annoying, and have turned me to other language learning resources. While the team has clearly put in a lot of work on the language learning aspect itself and I've learned a lot from it in the past there's a huge disconnect and it's made this app kinda suck. I'm so curious who you think your target audience is and why you thought the changes made were a good idea."
"The app never loads so I uninstall it and reinstall it. Also, I'm a visual learner so the audio dialogue is super hard. You have to replay it many times and still can only pick up a few words of what they are saying. If the dialogue was shorter it might help. There needs to be a small introduction to each section. For example, why you use de la and other times you use du. I'm still trying to figure this out."
"I like Duolingo & am learning a lot, but lately the app loads soooo slowly that I get frustrated waiting (and often losing precious 2x XP minutes). I'm over 800 day streak & for the last 100+ days have been having problems with the lessons loading despite closing/reopening the app, uninstall/reinstall, and shutting down the phone. Not a network connection issue either, always on fast WiFi."
"App is all right, but when you're doing the lightening rounds w/ an XP booster, it consistently doesn't give you the XP, & sometimes even subtracts the XP. Also the main lessons are only 5 XP now, which sucks. the only way you'll hit your quests is either doing a million of the main lessons or doing the lightening rounds which again, sometimes don't give you XP. Would also like to see the lessons update more. I've gone through the entire Arabic course & it hasn't updated in months."
"Been using Duolingo since 2016. I absolutely disliked the December 22 update where they changed the UI but stayed around anyways. But now the newest update just made me give up on this bird. I start off lesson one to warm up, to remember the very basics. Lesson one is now vocabulary that I haven't even learned and I was at level 3! I had Level 1 and 2 as legendary but they deleted all that progress! Add with the frustrations of the December update, I'm absolutely infuriated. Uninstalling"
Good until update. I kept a Duolingo subscription for over a year until recently. The update a few months ago was not for the better. The lessons are harder. I learn/retain less. I'm not reminded to review older vocabulary. And the end assessments are so difficult (with no hints) that I have to pull up translation apps just to pass. That's the opposite of what I want from a program supposed to teach me. I miss the old version of Duolingo.
"I agree with everyone else about the ""snake"" theme it has now developed. Really disappointing. Also, I used to learn Irish Gaelic on it, and the good thing is that the speech audios are now available but the bad thing is that the dialects have changed. And now I have to start from the top to learn the language with the new dialect."
"It is becoming increasingly frustrating to use this app. Between the microphone fuction stalling, to it at one time giving easy ""hard exercises"" to insane in the time challenges, especially when i have an XP boost. This app at times feels like it is trying to sabotage me. I enjoy the gamified aspect of this, as it uses competetition to drive your desire to learn, but when it sabotages me.. To top it out the app is glitching terribly rn. Looking for an alternative.."
"Lessons take too long to load in comparison to before, even with Super Duolingo. I often get ""error occurred"" and have lessons not load and crash. When I often tap to switch language courses the button does not respond or switch them. Additionally, I do not appreciate not having the option to go back to the former Duolingo tree format. When will Duolingo listen to its users' feedback?"
"The Android app is frustrating. I don't think there is anyone in the Help department, except an automated reply. Problems: 1) during timed challenges, it stalls. 2) during timed challenges where 2x XP are supposed to be given, it doesn't double the points. 3) I like to practice pronunciation. After 10 minutes of practicing pronunciation, I get an error message & it won't load the exercise. Also, I don't like the path. We should be able to choose. Some of the lessons are nonsense & not applicable"
Dropped another star. I've used the new linear progression and thought it would grow on me. It hasn't. The old format worked well to keep me motivated by letting me switch up what I was learning at will. I was also able to review old lessons and keep them fresh and repeat them more. I have not retained hardly anything since the path has gone linear. There's no more tips on the Japanese grammar. The progression is boring. I no longer enjoy playing or using duolingo. It worked great before.
"I used to like Duolingo a lot better, but their new format is frustrating. I know which concepts I need extra review on, but I cannot find a single lesson to actually help me review them. The old format allowed me to pinpoint specific concepts and review and practice them easily. My keyboard in the app also suddenly stopped working as well recently, and I can only assume some update didn't go well. I've sent error reports on issues with my account, and have never gotten a response or a fix."
"I like it but the heart system makes its stressful trying to learn a language. It's a barrier and when I was offered to the free 3 day trial, I made so much more progress without worrying about running out of the ability to learn through the app. It makes me not want to continue using it and seek other forms of learning that will be more efficient and effective. Too many ads as well. Really annoying, there's stability issues with the ""free"" version. Seems like they favor those who can afford it."
"A lot of fun (for casual and competitive alike). The method used makes it very easy to learn very difficult concepts. I have tried multiple languages and quickly noticed if one speaks at the same speed the app speaks, you WILL be counted wrong. The app's ability to PROPERLY identify audio is non existent. My time is valuable and I will not waste it correcting what is already correct."
"Been using the app for 9 years now. The fact that the badge system is busted and there is no way to contact anyone makes me not want to use the app anymore. Badges are now unlocked through quests and not XP. Which means when the app crashes (which happens all the time) it sees that you finished the quest but won't add it as completed towards your badge. It's disheartening to be working towards something and because of a technical error, you can't unlock it. Very demotivating to continue."
"Once you log-in to an old account, it does not give you an option to access your account settings, but forces you straight into an old language and through a lesson (which of course takes longer if you make too many mistakes, i.e. trying to power through it just to GET to your dashboard or account settings). I wanted to revive an old account but the user interface rendered that far more difficult than it needed to be (and irritated me right out of continuing to do so)."
"I used to love this app, took a break, and now that I'm back, I'm having a ton of bugs. It makes the process frustrating. I've uninstalled/reinstalled, made sure it was updated and still have issues with some of the pronunciation questions not answering correct (even when I had my native speaker friend try to make sure it wasn't me messing it up) and my monthly challenges won't load. It's insanely frustrating."
"At first approach it seems like a fun and decent learning tool. However, these problems make it frustrating; the listening is often hard to understand (unless in slow mode), most of it goes slow but sometimes it just skips by certain things in grammar and sentence structure especially, and somwtimes when I answer using the word I was taught and it says it's wrong offering a completely new word Id never seen as the correct answer, when I correct the mistake it says the new word is wrong."
"Like others, I really dislike the new design. It's hard to navigate and has really killed my excitement for learning by making me do every review level rather than skipping around. I am on Unit 6 for italian, and I'm STILL filling in the blank for ""it is"". I'm sure the new format has its perks but it should be able to be toggled back to the original version."
"I've been on Duo for 6 yrs. It seems that in an attempt to offer more courses, Duo sacrificed quality. In general the quality of new courses that had come out in the last 3 yrs have been disappointing. I've left many feedbacks in the hope of trying to help them improve. But it seems that the feedback channel is unattended. The quality of the early course like FR from EN, ES from EN, and DE from EN are good. The rest not so much. The learn French from Chinese courses are especially deplorable."
"(Oh, and after the 2nd round, it's an ad. Every time. Get you hooked then nonstop ads). The app is a lot of fun but after every other lesson, it freezes on a black screen. Seems to happen after every reward or wanting me to buy the app. Why would I spend money on something I need to shut down and restart every 5 mins?"
"I've been learning a language for over 150 days so far. It's extremely aggravating to try translating a sentence only to find that the correct words/phrases to complete the lesson are not even available to select, leaving you stuck in a loop of incorrect answers with no way to pass other than to restart the lesson and hope the specific problem doesn't happen again. The flag feature does absolutely nothing. Would be a fantastic app if this bug didn't continue happening."
"Loved duolingo for years, up to this point. The new updated version gets stuck once in a while and for the first time I've received a message to quit the app. Some animations can be removed to save on processing (e.g. lip syncing of avatar when speaking). Pls fix. I would love to enjoy the app once again. Storyboards are gone :("
"The new version of Duolingo is awful. It's very disjointed, unorganized, and confusing. I don't understand the learning objectives of each chapter, or how the difficulty level progresses. There are many typos and errors that interfere with learning, and they don't refund the diamonds lost due to their errors."
I rated this for the reasons that this app needs more missions to complete as well as a section of everything we are learning with a description of each word. The super Duolingo is not all that. That needs to be changed. Yes it can let you redo what you did wrong in learning and a boost in practice and listening but that's it. At least with apps like drops they keep a log of all the words you learn. There's just so much this app should be doing.
"After 3 years, my frustrations are too much to ignore. The translations are inconsistent which make it difficult to glean the principles of sentence structure and conjugation. There's very little guidance to teach you overarching principles of HOW to conjugate and structure sentences. The UI is pretty good and they've got a lot going to keep you engaged. But I learned more about the rules behind things from my boyfriend than I ever got from the lessons."
"The app has changed too many times and I feel like you're punished for too many mistakes with the hearts feature. I can't learn that way. It used to not matter how many times you got something wrong, the lesson would continue while letting you realize what you got wrong and now it just feels like there is pressure. This is my personal opinion but if you like that kind of content then this is the learning app for you. Personally though, I will be finding something else."
"Ok so - things have changed. Still the only viable option for learning some languages. However, they have a nasty pattern of yanking features away and disregarding user feedback. Examples: You can no longer download lessons for offline. The app does it automatically so you have no control. It's flaky and you're sure to run out of lessons to do on a long plane flight. Recently they removed the option to type in your home language. You can still type in the language you're learning. Baffling"
The snake like formatting is absolutely atrocious for courses with lots and lots of units. I use(d) Duolingo for grammar practice and vocab so I can always skip to the newest levels. It's horrible to go scroll so much to get to an interesting topic I want to practice. I'm seriously expected to scroll for a literal minute? The organization and ease of accessing early lessons NEEDS to be improved.
"I'm learning Korean. It's fun, but not a good learning resource. You'll get lots of sentences that don't make any sense. There's no explanation for the sentence structure and the particles, and the definitions of words are sometimes misleading or innaccurate. The voice is a robot voice so it doesn't sound right a lot of times. There's also no vocab list as far as I can tell. It's really really underwhelming. But it is fun. I just wish it was more useful"
"The app is full of bugs. Many answers are not correct, and they have non-sense. The points often counted wrongly. 2 days ago, I had earned 1415 points (I have a screenshot). Today, I checked, and it is 1384, including that I made a couple of practices during these two days. The same was noted many times. One time, I lost my spot because of the bug, and I was kicked out of the league. RIDICULOUS!!!"
"I'd really like to give Duolingo a 5-star review, but ever since they changed the layout of the courses, it's become extremely ineffective and downright *oppressive* to learn any languages with it. I'm incredibly disappointed, since I was making great progress before they reduced their courses to gamified slurry. I would not recommend this app until they revert this incredibly bad change."
"The app has gotten leggy and I basically have to reset it every time I enter the app. The characters are frozen and I always have go to setting to put it on dark mood. I have learned a little bit of learning, but the app doesn't really explain things to you and if your struggling in an area you have to click practice mood until you finally get to the area your struggling in."
There are so many things that could be improved on... It's almost like none of the developers have ever tried to learn a different language. Languages that have masculine/feminine terms should be a whole lesson itself. Reviewing any areas that you are struggling with is also no exisant once you complete a unit. Spelling complex words in a foreign language without autocorrect or predictive text in the 3rd unit in the whole course is ridiculous. Start with basics...
"I used to enjoy this app, and was learning Italian well and enjoying seeing my progress and crowns come together. Then they switched from the Tree layout to this rediculous Path update layout. It is SO much worse now. I cannot choose certain areas to work on easily, much of my progress in the course was stripped, navigating the path to see what you have completed, need work on, or what is to come is an absolute nightmare. I honestly will likely abandon learning on this app and go elsewhere."
"I like the new ""road map"" approach, but the new points are way too low and I HATE the heart system. You give us goals for the day, but with limited time, the heart system makes it impossible to achieve, especially when you can't always hit the correct buttons. The heart system is enough to make me want to look for a different ap. I want to learn, not worry about mistakes. It used to be fun, it isn't anymore!!!"
"I don't hate the new ""path"" as much as everyone else, but I certainly don't like it. I feel like I don't get to spend enough time on each section or new thing. Additionally, you can no longer regain hearts by doing old lessons, and that's basically a dealbreaker; it really sucks to punish people for making mistakes while learning. Moreover, it now takes dramatically more time to refill lost hearts."
"Those annoying reminders stop once you pay it seems. Lost ALL progress in 2 languages. Speaking Almost Never works. No way to report issues other than when an answer is wrong. Doesnt explain nuances of your mistake so you keep making them. Started having issues after paying for plus! Losing progress, loading wrong, losing hearts for no reason and having to turn on unlimited instead of having the challenge. Everything was perfect before I bought a year!"
"I don't think it's possible to become fluent in any language simply by using this app. However, it is great for encouraging practice. In my opinion, it falls short due to its game like ranking system. I don't see how encouraging competition with other users of the app is helpful. Also, if you wanted to use this app like a game you can cheat and rank high pretty easily without doing much practice at all, which defeats the whole purpose of the app. The points don't always add up correctly 🤷🏾‍♂️"
"This app us to be great, you could jump between the lessons that you wanted to work on. Now you have only one option and thats their lesson flow. So when you are struggling with a specific lesson and can't figure it out, oh well, you can't come back to it later when it fits better with your learning curve. Once my member ship runs out, I will not come back."
"Worse every year. Features keep being removed that promote actually learning a language in favor of simplicity bent on drawing in new users. I can't believe how little you learn in a hour compared to a few years ago. Slow progression, no more forums, no exercises, less language tips - typing the answer isn't an option anymore on new sentences which is insane.. and if you use this on the app, get ready for an insane amount of ads for Duo Plus."
"I'm currently on a 91 day streak and I feel like I've barely learned anything. This really is aimed at being an addictive game more than really teaching a language. They don't teach you grammatical rules, it's purely repition and memorization. All in all this is a good supplement took, especially for kids while learning another language but you won't get fluent in a language just using Duolingo."
"Updating my review from 4 star to 2 star. Since the big update, you don't get as much XP as before. You get 5 XP for review a lesson when before it was 15-20. Also, since the big update, I've had issues with freezing. I'll be halfway through a lesson and the app just stops, or I'll open the app and you click on your lesson and nothing happens. I'm really disappointed because I'm close to a 365 day streak. I have put money into this as well because I was really into learning my languages."
Definitely not a full package. Disappointing. It doesn't properly teach grammar and makes you rely on external community resources to support your learning. It tries to frustrate you into paying money to learn from your mistakes after running out of hearts. No thanks! I ended up paying for Rocket Japanese instead as it's much more comprehensive and has voice recognition features where you get to practice pronunciation as well.
"Get rid of the pathways! I've seen duolingo have ups and downs over the years but would have have it 5 stars until they dropped the discussion boards. Even then it was a solid 4. This pathway system is so unfun though and geared towards generating revenue over the user experience. Duo, go back to the tree and I'll update my rating. 5 month update: I just wanted to come back and affirm the review wasn't reactive and the pathway is indeed terrible. It makes the experience less fun."
"Absolutely helps with learning a new language, but it's all the ""Super Duolingo"" and ""hearts"" that ruin the experience. If you mess up 5 times, you pay with the in game currency to get hearts back, or you wait 3 hours to get ONE heart. They try to advertise Super Duolingo a ton, but it's useless and costs money. It's super tedious and annoying for a casual player trying to learn something new. Go on computer if you have one, where all of these stupid features don't exist."
It used to be a much better app. They updated it a bit ago and changed the whole style. They made it harder to learn and easier to progress. Before it made you really earn and learn every level. Now I feel like I'm being spoon-fed so that I don't actually have to learn to progress. I don't care how nice it looks and all the little cute features they added if the actual purpose of the app is compromised. It's disappointing... I don't feel like I'm really learning anymore.
"There are a few things missing. What's the point of gems now? It was neat to aim for interesting new sections. There should be a section you can just renew basics, like animals, colors, numbers, foods, rooms, so forth. There isn't enough room to list all the things that are missing. I unfortunately won't be renewing after my subscription runs out."
"Putting a at the beginning of a sentence, adding te or mi... None of this came up in the lessons and now I'm getting everything wrong because when I click for the help by tapping on words it's not correct either. 5/30/22: all of the above is still infuriatingly true. 2/24/2023 I feel like none of these issues have gotten any better since the update, if anything I feel like they've gotten worse. They may be trying to teach us a language in a more natural way, but we almost never get the ""why."""
"I've been using duolingo for more than 5 years and have learned Italian, Spanish, and am working on German. The new app design is still terrible. It constantly pushes me forward without giving any incentive to go back to previous lessons to strengthen what I've learned. I don't feel like I'm learning anymore. It just keeps getting worse."
"I put a review up and it was oddly taken down. As I said before the app is okay but it just takes too many stars. The speech to text feature pretty much sucks because it catches your answers sometimes and sometimes not. App is glitchy, you'll give a correct answer and they'll answer will be wrong, but it counts yours as wrong, then you'll have to redo the entire question, with a new answer, and make a lower score. I'm looking for a new language learning app."
"I feel like after a while, the lessons start feeling stagnant. It's good that it encourages daily practice. But, the biggest thing that gets frustrating is that with no rhyme or reason the app will flag certain flipped letters as incorrect. Ie buer vs beur. I'm dyslexic, I make letter flip mistakes a lot, sometimes when I'm having a bad day and it seems to coin toss decided a word is wrong I get so exasperated that I just close the app. It just doesn't feel friendly to dyslexic ppl."
"I love the Duo Podcasts, the experiences & life stories are thrilling to hear. I would learn more from that if I could find the fully printed transcript. However, there is such a big disconnect between the Podcasts and the Duo Language app. After 9 months of using the paid version of French, I can definitely say that there is nothing that I have learned in the app that would help me understand the Podcast any better unless they are saying a number less than 100 or a family member. Goodbye Duo!"
"I thought this app was good, however I'm quickly growing tired of it. I'm noticing the lessons tend to be too repetitive. I know this might be a bit difficult but I think you would be better off learning whatever language in a class, it's at best only good for vocabulary. Bear in mind this isn't even some barely spoken language I'm talking about, I'm basing my experiences off of the German courses. And honestly out of the 2 years I've done Duolingo I've learned more from actual language classes."
"I have been using this app for about 5 years and the decline in quality and heavy push for microtransactions is absolutely ridiculous. I understand they need more income than just ads but some of the ""free"" features are literally unusable without using boosters (which obviously cost money when you run out), especially the events. Just unfortunate because the app used to be great, I really don't mind watching ads and having some premium features I can't use but every update it gets worse."
"been a Duolingo user since 2013. i am also not a fan of the new system. i have 5 languages going on this app and the new design doesn't recognize when i switch languages. the map layout also feels like it's slowing my progress, but maybe that's an intentional choice by Duolingo, i'm not sure. definitely prefer the old way, sorry!"
"Paid for Super. This app does the bare minimum at trying to teach a language. It does nothing to teach grammar, nothing to allow for discussion, and teaches very few words over time. Most of your time is wasted puzzling together sentences with individual words, hoping in vain you heard the voices correctly. There is little to keep you at it unless you get sucked into the ""league"" which promotes repeating easy lessons over and over to gain points instead of actually learning. Find another app."
"Good app, until you reach an ad that you can't close after it plays. Then it's basically worthless, until you close and restart it. There is a little ""x"" there but tapping it doesn't close the ads. Yes, plural, as in more than one ad is causing this issue."
"Will NOT load beyond splash screen(IF it even goes beyond the black screen) without internet access!(SOMEtimes it even gets stuck on the black screen WITH internet access!!!) 😑 AND, in that scenario, it'll just sit there doing nothing instead of displaying a reason for its apparent malfunction. ...which, ya know, is AWEsome for troubleshooting.🤨 Pathetic."
"I used to really enjoy this app but, updates have made it a bad and frustrating experience. Points that I earn disappear for some reason. It's more difficult to stay in certain leagues. New words are introduced that have never been seen before. Very frustrating!!!"
"App's great, but for some reason none of the icons to start a lesson show up on my chromebook. I've seen another review say the same thing, so it's not only mine that's messed up. It works just fine on my phone. It's a five-star app, but if the app doesn't even work, I can't really give it that high of a rating. I hope this bug gets fixed soon."
"Meh. This app is really frustrating. There isn't really any teaching to it, it's memorization. When a mistake is made, it ""ughfdrghu"" at you and gives the correct answer at the bottom but without guidance. I'm neither over- nor underwhelmed. Just whelmed. I'll be looking for another language teaching app."
"Learning Hindi. Duolingo doesn't teach anything. It just throws questions at you and you learn by trial and error and mimicking. But there's no description of sentence structure, how vowels are applied to consonants, or any other concepts. And there's so much repetition, it becomes frustrating. But skipping means you'll miss the one thing you needed to learn. Works a bit as a supplement to a real class."
"I have been learning Japanese on here for a year now and while it's an ok intro, it does a HORRIBLE job teaching you WHY things are how they are. Makes you memorize sentences without any explanation of the grammar or sentence structure. It got me started, but without any actual coursework it won't get you very far. You can't keep learning a language by just memorizing words. Not to mention the new layout is absolutely appalling and takes any enjoyment or personal preference out of the experience"
"New UI makes it harder to review and removes some freedom of choice. Progress transfer is a crapshoot. Desktop features are different. Not a good service for east Asian languages, but okay for most popular European languages. Actively tries to nickle and dime you despite ads. Not amazing for language learning in the first place; lacks some theory and rigor compared to other approaches, even if you take the gamification into account."
"Duolingo has been an excellent and fun learning experience overall. However, the new update is almost unusable due to very serious bugs. Testing into new lessons doesn't work correctly, it seems to show me at different progression points each time I visit the main screen, the app crashes, etc. I'm very close to giving up at this point. It's extremely disappointing."
"I really liked the idea of the new path format, but in practice, it takes way longer and is more difficult to progress. I liked being able to jump around to different lessons and levels. Some hybrid of the two, or allowing the user to choose which they want, would be better! Hope they take the feedback seriously. I loved Duolingo before, but now it's just frustrating:("
"2022 update: The new layout is a pain to use and the switch over messed up my progress. I'm struggling to stick with it Pretty fun and teaches at a good pace. I've been having issues with some multiple choice questions presenting the correct answer twice, with only one of them being accepted, but overall a great tool. Kinda wish the spoken bits were louder, I feel like I'm constantly turning the volume up to hear them clearly, only to have the ads ridiculously loud if I don't turn it back down."
"Like many others, I find the new layout frustrating and not enjoyable. I cannot pick which area/topic to practice anymore. I have just finished 3/5 lessons within a station and the exercises where all the same! At least before I could pick what to practice and not be forced to repeat the same thing over and over. There is no way to personalize the learning experience, which is a fail to me because different people have different learning styles."
"I really don't like the new linear design. Sometimes I just want to do a story, other times I might want to do a bunch of lessons in a row - just let me choose for myself! Hints are nonexistent which is SUPER frustrating. How are you supposed to learn grammar with no upfront explanation? A tech issue: Sometimes the mic doesn't work unless you minimize the app first. This only happens with the large button with a picture of a mic on it, other voice buttons work fine."
"Hate the new design. It's boring & feels like homework. I liked being able to choose different topics & plan my progression. You had options, people who wanted to go thru one at a time could just do that. But now the folks who DON'T want to do that don't get to choose. 🙄 feels like you're progressing much slower & it doesn't make as much sense. Wish they would put it back. On top of the various bugs it already had, kinda bummed this happened right after I paid $80+ for the year subscription."
"Keeps changing layout for learning! Over the 2 years I've been using this, they have changed the way the lessons work at least 4 times, each time making it worse! Just got 'pathed' which means I have to follow their lesson plan path, not able to jump around anymore. Not sure I will stick with app much longer. Each time they change it, I'm almost forced to go back to beginning because I'm missing some things that I hadn't seen yet but am now expected to know."
I loathe the new update. I used to do 5-10 lessons a day for the past 3 years and made great progress but I now feel so demotivated. The new version might be great for new learners but for established students it makes no sense. Before I felt I could focus on a topic of learning and the repetition helped me remember both words and structure. The lessons in the new version seem so random. There's minimal repetition and nothing sticks. There's no focus to each lesson or set of lessons.
"I came to write a review just to stay how much I DESPISE the new update. I learn best when I am able to move around the subject matter a little bit. Separate stories and the lesson tree was perfect for me because I wasn't stuck doing one type of content. It's especially bad when I feel frustrated by a lesson group, it's extremely discouraging and makes me not want to use it at all because there's no longer an option to try a different lesson group or go through some stories if I'm feeling stuck."
"The newest update makes the learning process too linear and rigid. It was a much better learning experience when the modules were split up into a ""tree"", giving the user the opportunity to move around between lessons and stories. The new format is clearly geared more towards causing the user to spend more gems to fully complete lessons. I suppose that it will be more likely to generate revenue. Not as effective as or enjoyable as before."
"At first this app was really pretty good. I really enjoyed it and was working my way through the Italian course and have been paying for a subscription for over a year. They totally redid the app a few weeks ago. Since the rewrite I am totally lost. Suddenly the app is throwing me a ton of words and sentence structures that I've never seen before. There are no explanations or assistance. It is like it dropped me into the middle of someone else's progress. Sadly, I am likely to cancel now."
"I can take or leave the new Path UI. It's not the greatest, but it also isn't the end of the world as some would have you believe. I have only studied two languages so far, but as I keep getting deeper into one of them (German), the proofreading has gone WAY downhill, and MANY of the suggested answers to mis-identified typos are phrases that bear no resemblance to the lessons you have gone through up to that point. You get no responses to bug reports, either."
"Duolingo had been amazing and over the past few years even taught me enough French (along with other methods) to do some work in France. But...the new interface isn't working for me. Before I could focus on areas I needed help and skip the in-depth work of areas I was secure. Now.it has taken me back to areas I skipped, where I'm already pretty secure. But testing out of areas is too picky and frustrating. I can't customize my learning for me. This frustration makes it boring and hard to use."
"New redesign is confusing and less usable. Lessons used to have concise names and graphics indicating content; now they are only numbers in a series with descriptions not easy to parse when looking to go back and practice a particular lesson. Update also merged stories into the lesson sequence, but in doing so, it marked me as having completed lots of them that I never did, which is annoying. Overall, changes feel pretty de-motivating, to be honest. Shame, I liked this app."
"I used to love this app. But I HATE the new overhaul. Bring back the system where it's easier to see units and choose what we wanna work on within them. The never ending path of 0 choice is not for me. If you're new maybe it won't bother you—but if you're an old Duolingo hat returning, consider yourself forewarned. EDIT: After being on the new format for about a month or more, I can say that I find it harder—but not in a way that's actually helpful. It's harder to actually retain new words."
"I loved the previous version of Duo because it gave you the option to bounce between a few mini lessons at once as you progressed but now you can only do one lesson at a time, which I feel makes you just blast through each one without retaining as much. That, and tracking the levels you've attained in previous lessons isn't as obvious now, and the titles of the past lessons don't display automatically anymore, making it hard to find them to review."
"I used to like the app, but will no longer pay for it. Many of the languages are pretty decent (I've done Japanese, Korean, and Spanish). However, some of the features I paid gems for disappeared and I contacted support multiple ways & times and go no response. The recently changed the layout which does not allow you to choose your study method (review or continue) as it did before, thus making less useful, especially the teacher side of things. I lost access to league and language add ons."
It will teach you some but there is a level system. You can move up every week by training more than other people. You can also drop by not doing a lot of training. Since an update it is best to just practice the first lesson with a 2x boost twice a day for 15 minutes so you can stay at the level you are at rather than learn anything new. It is for this reason that I give it the low score. Since I am no longer learning I am un-installing the app. The new system rewards the wrong behavior.
"This was a great app, but the quality was reduced with this recent format change. Lessons in each section were reduced, vocabulary words used in stories are not taught or used in associated lessons, and there are a lot of glitches (eg, calling an answer incorrect when it is right or having random words in exercises that were NEVER introduced in any way). I miss the old format."
"This app is used by sex website scammers, like US agencies, to find potential marks. Chat is hard to use, as there will be popup windows in your face as you try to type. You cannot even read the entirety of the popup. It seems to have a lot of bugs, such as images not loading most of the time. My internet connection becomes quite unstable when using this app. Not everything is in English. Maybe it would be easier to understand if the tutorial windows were fully displayed. You can't batch delete"
"Almost identical to LiveMe, there's even a few of the same people on there. But it seems easier to navigate and there's plenty of variety, although there is a pretty good chance that most of the people who almost immediately ask for your number and personal info, ie., home address, etc, are fakes. They'll send you nudes but it's all out of a spread from a photoshoot. Probably not even who you're talking to. Sorry if this pisses anyone off, just thought I'd give a heads up with a REAL disclaimer."
"Though I do enjoy this app, I do wish there were a couple useful changes. The first being more filter options rather than just hashtags when searching for a livestream, for example, I keep running into a lot of broadcasters who speak everything but english, I wish there was a filter option for languages. The second major change I would like to see happen (though I doubt it ever will) is adding a section for those who are 18 years above age so that more explicit content can be showed."
"I love the app. Going live is the only thing I've been able to figure out and for some reason, it keeps saying i have no gifts and no diamonds, despite the fact that i have had a lot of both sent to me. And when i say a lot, i mean A LOT. So I'm losing out and i don't like that. But it's very fun. If it wasn't so fun and i wasn't doing so well on it, i would be giving it 1 star. But as I'm having a good time, I'll give it 2 for now."
"Doesn't seem to work properly on my new Google Pixel 7 Pro, freezes & clears chat when minimising rooms, going off app etc, also YouTube videos in multis don't work properly anymore on my Google phone, the picture flashes/changes size etc, good job I don't have epilepsy or anything"
"Not specific in what I'm after,no type chat rooms.its all random and hard to get anywhere that's up to my class, am not seeing this as a big open ""right way"" very limited"
"after android 13 update on my poco f3, bigo has stopped working in the background. when i press back every active broadcast closes with a message the broadcast has ended. i have checked everything at my side its not the case with any other app its just BIGO Live facing this problem."
"Pretty good and once you get some favorite streamers/a good following it's chill. But there's a lot of bland people on it, an people that autokick a lot, and a ton of bots following and asking for follows"
Too many pop ups and notifications that lags the device. Recommend turning them off.
"The administrators are always stopping the live show when it becomes very interesting. This is an adult site, we all should be given some liberty. Thanks."
Bigo is now worse app now find it difficult to follow after following few peoples it will be notified try it next day after next day the following click will still remain the same try to find solution to fix the follow click problem
"App isn't bad. Can be fun at times. But the constant notifications that I get are getting out if hand. I have them turned off in the app and blocked on my phone, but yet still get them. Probably time to Uninstall if it doesn't get fixed soon"
Not so great. My phone's.sound is now locked because of someone on your app.
"For some stupid reason bigo keeps banneding me , and Its for no reason, please fix problem, it has already happened to me 21 times and it's a pain I'm about to quit...."
Please fix the Desktop version of Bigo. It doesn't operate the same anymore since about 2 weeks ago.
Well my experience is good and it's bad because I've been sending things to all my friends and everything and I haven't been getting my reward for
is this a streaming app or another tinder app in the making its like Americans have rules but other countries don't have to follow the rules with this app
It was working and did an update now it startsloading and then stops and goes back to the beginning of the app.
I don't have the background option I just have I just have the filters.
"If I really wanted to pay for some one to tease me for money ,I expected way better, besides even if they were unclothed AI I prefer a real sweat.... And s smell of a living breathing soul"
Rules have changed and very disappointed. Now I cannot gift my favorite host and make it count to quota
"Broadcasters who chooses to expose their nudity should be allowed and should not be blocked, they are the ones who keeps the app trending . I will increase your rating to 5stars if you do it. Thanks There should be a provision for searching for individual broadcasters. By allowing broadcasters their choice of display keeping guys on the App longer thereby giving the owners/administrators more money. The above points should be looked into critically and given positive consideration."
"more freebies will be better, I load up a couple of times and I got lot of bugs saying try another time or try different mode of payment its such when you are a paying customer and you can't get proper service, it would be better if they can give something for spending too much time getting to loading up gems"
"I can't seem to get the visual host up on my phone, help? I love the app but for some reason it won't let me do the visual host, I'd give a five star but I really would love to use the virtual host. Other than that, I have no problem with the app, I love it."
"I gave 2 only because the process of retrieval of a banned(mistakenly)account isn't exactly resourceful. As it seems one would have to be in a family or refry beans excessively, jk! Overall it's a superb tool for networking."
"This app bypasses the O/S notification settings. Even turned off it still sends messages, which is quite intrusive when one has turned this off to keep notifications silent."
The app is good but it has a small problem. There are to many naked girls which is very annoying you can't make friends through this. Please fix that.
"Have all notifications for the app turned off, both in the app and my settings, and yet they still somehow send me around 20 push notifications a day....."
"A lot going on at once... Probably not for my particular demographic age wise, if I figure it out I'll increase my stars..."
I used you app 9nce but I uninstalled due the reason that I don't have the money needed just to get noticed. I'm welling to give it one more try but if I keep having the same problem I will uninstall it again. Also I wouldn't reinstall it until this problem is fixed people who can't pay the money to get noticed shouldn't have to use this app it feels a little bit too unfair to me.
Wow im surprised... I did a feedback for correcting some misspell words in your app about few days ago and I log in today to double check it found out it already corrected after my feedback BUT you guys didn't reply to thank me... Seriously???
"THIS APP IS FUN & ADDICTIVE, HOWEVER THE RULES ARE VERY RIDICULOUS & STRENUOUS....TOO MUCH BANNING GOING ON FOR NO REASON. ALSO, BIGO IS BIASED WHEN IT COMES TO HONORING CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS SUCH AS RELEASING HOSTS FROM THEIR AGENCIES, WHEN YOU ARE NOT THE BIGGEST ASSET IT **SEEMS** LIKE. WRITING TO FEEDBACK IS KINDA USELESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY LISTEN TO US & GIVE US A SOLID RESOLUTION...RATHER THEY RESPOND WITH A LOT OF COPY & PASTE ""POLITICAL"" MESSAGES & TELL US TO TRY & FIX IT"
"H9rny streaming only, not surprised but disappointed that's all that goes on here. I don't even see stream names or categories to find streams? Instantly got bot messages without even fully setting up my account"
"Wow,,boring people from around the world, ya! Play with my hair, do my makeup,,,give me gifts?,,if they really were worth following they would not be on here,,whhhat? No gifts,,,mute. LoL what a sad little app. ,,,proves that the majority is pretty much the same worldwide,,,knew this already, bye app."
This is so glitchy needs to fix it up I give 5 star about this is so glitchy . I give 2 star
Why any wifi network not connecting with BIGO?
It's not letting me follow people on here at first it was but then after that it's saying failed every time I try to follow somebody that says failed please fix this I would appreciate if you fix it like that I'll bring the Stars up and reach you more
It's getting more have fun to meet many pretty babes.
Charging to much for diamonds. To many updates. Games are rigged. Non host exchange rate fails. Too many pop ups.
Not really a fan of streaming..which this app is primeriely based on.. it's also rather difficult to navigate. It's as though they were trying to fill up space with random things to click..
"Great app if you know how to use it and have s good community on it, but there are many issues with how it works and ESPECIALLY the servers."
"Why i cant recharge by gcash ,,,,and there is no show of other option to recharge.. no gcash there"
Whatever update you did is greatly affecting my gaming and movie streaming content and I think I should have proper compensation for it. The mirroring capability under GAMING stream does not allow the audio to go through while the screen shows the video app. Unless you go back to bigo app screen which ow does not make any sense for streaming games and movies. Why? Because you viewers cannot hear your audio.
"I liked this app to make friends all over the world, but I see a lot of security issues. I found a suspicious activity on my credit card after I used my card to buy diamonds. and also I am frustrated with some hackers who joins in to live broadcasts then can see and change some secure settings on behalf of a host. The support(feedback) is not helpful at all. It's free to join, but expensive to buy virtual diamonds. The built in music player is not available to all users too."
"No more split screen. No more slide from right, u can see host that live while u in the other live room. Bla..bla..blaa😒😕"
"It's been good but for some reason the video quality on my phone is terrible. My phone camera has ×300 of the video quality than the video on the app. Unfortunately, the issue seems to be specific to me. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it but no change. Please note that my phone is a very good phone and it's only the app's video quality/resolution that is very terrible. Other than that, it's an awesome app providing beautiful memories and opportunities."
It is a great app in concept but lacks some features. There should be a browse feature to search for users with specific tags and the fact that it only plays through phone audio instead of media is incredibly frustrating. Make the app play through media instead of my phone speaker and I'll bump this up to 4 stars.
I love this app. It offers thousands of Karaoke for your favourite songs. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in music. It allows you to explore worldwide and provides a platform to easily duet with others and even join a family. The reason I gave a four and not five is that I couldn't access the VIP which restricted me from doing certain solo's but still can join duet's so it's worth your space and time. Enjoy it!
"3 major issues with the app: 1) the chat window is so tiny you can only see one line at a time. 2) I turned off all notifications and I still get notifications 🤦 3) it keeps suggesting girl for me to take to cause I'm a guy, but like, I'm gay, so it's annoying af. It's a nice concept though."
"The concept is a creepy, though the app does what it says it does. The idea of thousands of young people live streaming themselves in return for digital gifts is very strange. A lot of the content was sexually suggestive though I didn't see anything that technically crossed the line into pornography. Overall I would not recommend."
"BIGO live is not worth anyone's time. It's boring, the UI is too busy. The app itself is all about making the person who's live money and you broke. Where are the apps nowadays that don't break your pocket like this one does and it's more about having fun, meeting new people. Oh meeting new people locally is hard friggin thing to do. I definitely would of met a few cuties but too bad they're 3000 miles away even though location is on. There are glitches and lagging on watching video sessions."
"Too many bots Picture Verification dark theme/dark mode option would be appreciated, easier on the eyes. Would be cool to be able to switch from a live video stream to audio only mode stream or vise versa during a live instead of having to end it & start it all over again just to switch the type of mode. Add all types of colors for the background on the audio only mode, theres not many options on colors. Add live video call & phone calls for private messages.Different backgrounds for live video"
This app cost too much to interact with live streamers. The app is designed to get you to spend money. However you get very little back for spending money. Some features are hidden away. An example is the recharge reward section for a first time purchase. It is hidden away in a section with a small banner. I only found this option after my first recharge. And only after been told by a friend on the app. I wrote to support and submitted feedback but never received a reply. The methods of payment offer widely different values for the amount spent vs diamonds given. My advice is to never purchase diamonds. You recieve next to nothing for doing so. I will continue to use this app but I urge those considering downloading it to not spend real money on this app. In response to the dev reply. I've tried to use the feedback and support systems but never received a reply.
"-No landscape mode -Uses a crapton of battery -Very frustrating to type messages as whenever you try, random popups appear over the keyboard, so you end up tapping on some other random thing -If you have nav buttons hidden in your phone settings (so you have to swipe up to see them), the app interprets this swipe as changing to another stream -Cluttered UI -Extremely bulky and bloated to use in general"
"They like to ban you for the littlest thing and this is second time I was banned for something stupid I went to go get something to drink and someone reported me saying I was underage which I am not, it also said something about violence to there's no violence in my lives."
"Nice girls and cheep fun. However the few issues with it I currently have is I can not yet delete the account due to techinical issues with the latest verson atl least the option is becoming available but it is not downloading new verson so that plus also unable to remove my debit card info I entered as well, lastly from my experience use it wisely and do not reveal too much personal info for further communication... Just play as it as it is. If they fix issues I fix review..."
Once I started going live like one time it wouldn't show my face so I made other one then it would show my face but a few seconds r few minutes after that I wasn't be able to go live for 10 minutes I tried to do it again then I got banned because I was a kid and I'm trying that make friends I'm just trying to make friends and you ban me like I'm a kid that just trying to make friends please unban (I didn't think you would respond bingo LIVE)
This app runs horribly with Android. I have a pixel 6 every time I stream live only on bigo does it overheat my phone to the point It shuts down. I reached out to my carrier. This phone says it's compatible with app. There's no tech support for bigo. It's frustrating! No real customer service and it's a hypocritical app.
I am a long time user of this app. I invest a lot of money into the support of this app. I've met a lot of great people through this app. Never had too many issues until recently. I try to open the monthly family battle to join a family and it freezes and crashes the app every time. This issue has been persistent for over a week now. Please fix this.
"I actually didn't download it because I don't need it, but I'm posting this comment to say you need to change your ads. Every ad on this I see is girls twerking, blowing kisses, or really weird shtick. This is probably an awesome app, but just please change the ads."
"Its a good idea to meet people however it needs a lot of work. The app is all over the place ..not organized I felt lost in it, Alot of bot and fake followers and fans, the moment you sign up they start to increase quickly, You can't control the language you want to see the app with ..no further questions is asked to customize your profile and privacy."
"I'm back for another review I've been annoyed that bigo has bots and so it doesn't show the real amount of people, I remember at one point there was a glitch in the system where it showed us the real amount of people. It was satisfying to see that I wasn't talking to myself. but I recommend you guys to join the app to meet new people and to socialise with others"
"It looks so stupid, I can't do anything but cringe when looking at this app, looks like it was made for 2 year olds or mentally disabled people. Reading some of the reviews, I can tell that they're fake because their name sounds insane and makes no sense, and their review sounds weird, like their grammar is crazy, they don't sound like normal people but someone might not notice if they're not paying much attention. This app looks like a scam."
I see it at ad i like it and i download it but when i download it have dangerous viruses bad speech hate coments soo plzz i reuquested to @bigo plz help uss from this if you fixed this i will give you 5 stars plzz 🙄🙄
"Why is my account suddenly locked, I can't send out gifts. It always tell me ""your balance is frozen"" I can't send not even exclusive gifts."
This app somehow bypass android notification block. Makes it Not trustworthy. What else are they prevy to on your phone
"Please do something as always need to update too much... wasting my data and lagging always... further more takes our hard earn money like more then half of it...like we gave 5diamond the host will only gets 1diamond wasted alot of money plus in Singapore no greedy, yummy and fisher"
I first download this app and get to the point to add in a birthday. I'm used to adding it in. But it doesn't even go far enough for me to add in my birthday! Why is it so hard to add in the next six months of the year or to let the calender keep going until further years?! I also HATE the calender method of adding in your birthday. Fix it.
"The app is cool but not great. I believe like 90% of the profiles I come across are fake! The women all say the same thing over and over again, no originality, that's boring and unoriginal. Wack! So I mostly just go to the app to look at pictures."
"it's cool and all, I mean it was really fun to meet new people. But most of the girls where dressed in very VERY VERY skin showing clothes like bras and underwear. I personally was uncomfortable in this position. I am a cosplayer and I want somewhere to live, unfortunately this is not it"
"Discrimination!!! I uploaded a very tasteful picture, fully clothed... bigo removed it 3 times. However all these Caucasian women can post whatever they like, all kind nudity showing and they never get banned"
Since I have not had any experience with this site I thought I'd browse through it and see what I was missing I stopped at the site and was checking out some of the dialog that was on site I must have had been taking away from the person's audience and was kicked out by person and that was my first experience with this site I am very grateful for the moment but I have to say I don't think that I was treated well and that person was not even willing to except that I was new and you don't tre
"Buggy: within 2 minutes of joining and trying to live stream, I was ""flagged"" for being underage (under 18)I am 32, and not sure I should be flattered or offended. However all the attempts I had in app to appeal were in vain, they allow you to submit a photo ID with age verification and a hatless photo, but it kept reading network error. The feedback button is also broken. Disappointed."
"Full of fake girl profiles that add you and message you then try and get you to send them money. Also when viewing a live stream the THIRST is cringy AF and on top of that the ""gift"" spam is so off putting and annoying you have to leave the stream. In short - if you're a simp and want to try and impress women by giving them free stuff this is the app for you!"
"Disappointing, great app but very accusing. Been accused of violating their rules when I didn't see myself doing so. It was enjoyable at first but now I feel like I have been accused of wrongful things, things that I never in my life done before."
Very good app but I can't purchase anything on the app
Don't quite get yet but very interacting
There is a glitch in the YouTube videos it flash again
It makes a whole lot of sense...I like it
Good app. One problem tho I'm into white girls ..... Only thing they so me is other wise like we get it you ain't racist
The two new icons on the bottom left of screen are unnecessary and annoying. People can simply swipe left if they dont want to see messages or gift effects
"I love the app, but my phone area code number is not there, i am from puerto rico"
"Some upsides, some very big downsides. Upsides: you can chat with people from loads of countries around the world & closer to home, too. People doing live streams look generally nice. Big downsides: Diamonds which you need to send digital ""gifts"" to the broadcaster are expensive, e.g. 450 for $10 but gifts vary from 1 diamond to 9999. Another big downside is there are several scammers with fake profiles now. When they latch on, you'll just want to leave. Basically, ""a license to print graphics""."
Way too much stuff going on the screen that you can't see the person you're watching Edit: i had to figure it my self that you can swipe right to make chat and some of the UI disappear and still see big dragon or lion show on screen you can make a better tutorial for the app
"I'm having issues trying to access the message inbox section, everytime I tap on it my phone freezes and then closes the app, is this an ongoing issue? Reply to developer: That's the section I cannot access, everytime I try to access that section it freezes the app and kicks me out."
"Fairly good app. Fairly good because you're faced with the risk of hackers hacking into your account to rip you of all your ""diamonds"" which you get by recharging with real money. Also, there's a lot of annoying bots, and Customer support is terrible. Asides that, it's a good app for meeting real people and communicating in real time. 2 stars for me"
"Hello, thank you for your efforts This program drains a lot of energy from my phone battery and the speed of connecting to people in live is very poor, and it is better to use various themes in this program, such as a dark theme for the night and the addition of Persian language and sports, medical and scientific content. Educational for all ages"
"How to disable screen recording during live, no tutorials. Some viewers take thier screen records to publish it to youtube."
"BURGER KING FOOT LETTUCE, also can you add dark mode in the settings? What kind of app that doesn't have dark mode!?"
We want the free lollipops back that come down and you have to click and gather them to send to people for XP towards your level increasing
Bigo custom alot of data but it a app where u can make friend fro different country and make money
"Very entertaining, I love it"
Bigo live is very useful. I like this app.
This last update was awful. Why would you make the font so small. You can't change the size back and can barely read the comments if you don't have perfect vision. Why even mess with the font at all
"I don't have any social media apps on my phone and download thus tried it and deleted after I read the permissions it wanted, what do you do with some much permissions on my phone, like I wanna download again but no man."
No idea how this app got on my any phone of mine. Every phone I get it seems to keep on randomly downloading it self to my phone. When it does my phone seems to get hacked and I loose a lot of digital assets and personally ID.
"This app has so many animations, that can't be disabled that it makes lower quality devices lag like crazy and first starting out on the app there's just so much complicated stuff to do that it's confusing."
"I've been using the app for a while and alot of the times the app works good. Just recently alot of the new features you've included I had access too, now all of a sudden I don't have access to them and this happens to myself regularly. What's up with that???"
"It was fun, but storage always hits my concern and fears. Every time I get notifications from this app, its app data increases and consumes my local storage. I don't know what to do."
"I love this app ,if you're looking to find something to do there always content for everybody and it is actually amazing The people that you connect with it's not like anay other app out there"
"I tried out the premium version because I'm starting a new project and Canva seemed ideal. It's definitely ideal if you like getting frustrated. Constant outages of some kind that make it impossible to save or edit. The app, on my Chromebook as well as my tablet, is so slow as to be useless. Yes, I've tried all the troubleshooting suggestions. Lots of great features and it would be a great resource--if it worked."
"Love Canva but app is very glitchy. Deleting elements/layers from a project doesn't work. Nothing happens no matter how many times I try. I used to be able to close the app & restart it to fix the issue, but that doesn't work anymore. It's become a huge pain. I pay for Canva pro & would love the convenience of using the app, but it's just not efficient with its glitchiness. Also, getting rid of shadows w/your latest rollout SUCKS!! It's an effect I used a lot for marketing materials."
"I am having the same issue as described in other reviews before me. I have waited patiently, hoping it was just a bug fix, but 2 updates later and still having issues. In the app, it will create new lines in text boxes without me touching my screen. It has made it impossible to edit graphics on the go. Very frustrating!"
"Great features, but constantly freezes and crashes when I'm in the middle of working. Hard to edit at times, features are hard to properly access on a tablet versus on a laptop or even cell phone. It just seems like it's not at all compatible to this device but they're forcing it to be. Definitely have some bugs to fix😔"
"goodness this app is very unintuitive. The unpaid version,at least. For simple, quick collages there are better free apps. I tried to create a new blank page, but you can't do that with the free version, and have to pick a premade. I deleted all the stock images, then couldn't figure out how to add more. The attempt resulted in two separate images, not to two on one page. I couldn't figure out how to resize the image so that a second could fit. I'm not spending any more time with this."
"I usually love this app and recommend it to everyone. But I've been having issues with editing text. The second I click on it, when the options to Edit, Font, Color, etc. pop up. The App is taking it upon itself to click, create spaces between lines, resize the text box. Add a bunch of space at the bottom so it's SO long I can't scroll to the top. Then if I try to backspace the space away, or use the undo arrow, it undoes it, but only until I click it again! It's absolutely infuriating!"
"I love this app, BUT, recently I've been getting a glitch(that others have been getting as well) that causes the text box to repeatedly get bigger as if I'm hitting the enter button again and again. It's very frustrating to have to hit the undo button over and over and over. PLEASE fix this issue🙏(no, restarting the app doesn't work, and no, uninstalling and reinstalling the app doesn't work)"
"As usual, a great app (the concept of it anyway). As another reviewer mentioned, the text boxes jump around uncontrollabley. The box expands downard infinitely making it impossible to write anything and often I close the app in frustration becuase I literally cannot do anything. I have reinstalled it on both devices and the problem persists. I have the paid version, and I can't even use it properly. And I've now realized that customer service is impossible to get ahold of."
"This is normally a great app, but recently it has been incredibly difficult to edit text in the app. Things that were once easy are now hard to complete. I am in the middle of working on an anniversary card and was adding a text box. As I was typing the text it started making a really long text box and now it is stuck where I can't edit anything or it all goes away. This makes me not want to use the app. Please fix this issue!"
"It seems easy but not really. They don't have auto border that we could just pull and place like it would on Photoshop so it's just hard to line up photos or text the way the Canva feature is. If you move it, and you got it lined, the second you take your fingers off screen, it moved on its own again and again and again. It would have been a decent app otherwise. Now it's just frustrating. However, considering I need something fast, here I am. Hopefully Canva can improve the features."
"If you want me to continue paying for this app, the text issue needs to be fixed. I cannot keep spending hours trying to edit only for the text to continuously keep moving across my screen. The text box gets bigger and bigger and it's almost like someone is controlling the screen. It's extremely frustrating. I love this app but I'm giving it another month before I cancel and find something else."
"use it all the time, even the free version is very robust, was 5 stars. Update Dec 2022: Recent update has made the app completely unusable if you're using text at all. Like other reviews have said, ANY manipulation of a text box adds space to the bottom of the box, throwing it out of shape and eventually stretching down far beyond the bounds of your project. Responses said to make sure it's the only app open and make sure it's up to date. Did all this and a fresh install. Problem persists."
"Having the same glitch as everyone else! No different keyboard installed just the stock android keyboard. When typing in a text box, it just continues to add carriage returns until there are so many you can't find the end of your text box. Phone up to date (android). Canva up to date. No keyboards installed just stock android keyboard. Doesn't do it on computer or iPad, just my phone."
"Last year, there was some big event announcing new features. This year, while working on projects as usual, there is a glitch that is making it nearly impossible to continue using canva. While adding text, the program now adds hundreds of blank lines below what I'm writing, that I have to keep deleting. But while deleting it continually adds spaces to the extent that I can no longer see my project above and I am unable to scroll up at all. One time, everything disappeared."
"I just got a new phone and was hoping the glitch I was having on my old phone would be fixed. However, not the case. As soon as I start texting in a text box, it grows exponentially (like there's a bunch of returns) without me hitting the enter button. Super frustrating, it makes it early impossible to use the app for designs."
"Canva gives me Options! I love the options for templates, photos fitting my content goals, the ability to add text and graphics with minimum time. Canva is my go to for all things content whether for digital content or physical flyers. Canva is awesome. But recently the app interrupts my editing and my text and designs or freezing or the app freezes and prevents me from being able to edit because it won't save"
"Let me start by saying, I love canva. Never thought I'd leave a poor review. But you guys seriously have to do something about this text box glitch that so many people are having. I can no longer use the mobile app because the app expands the text boxes until it's impossible to type or edit. Not only is it frustrating, but I feel like I'm only able to use my paid product half of the time."
so frustrated for weeks now! Everytime I add or edit text it automatically looks like I've hit enter repeatedly making my text boxes extremely long and off the page. Or the original size of the format resizes itself numerous times in seconds. I've updated again and still happening. Great app and designs if only it'd work smoothly.
"I used to love creating on this app, but recently, anytime I try to type any text, the text box keeps expanding until it's bigger than than the page itself. You can't delete the extra space or shrink the box as it just keeps getting bigger. I've tried to type my text elsewhere and paste it in the text box to see if I could get around it and sometimes that works but 9 times out of 10 I spend 10 to 15 mins trying to add text to my project only to have to use another app out of frustration."
"When this app works it's great but so often I'm using it and it glitches out. It will just start jumping lines as if I hit enter 10000 times until you're way off page and then it shuts down. Other times you'll be typing and the cursor jumps to somewhere else on the page, usually the beginning of the line you were typing so you have nonsense happening. If you hit the space bar it might not put the space it or it might jump somewhere else. It's really frustrating."
"I'm not sure what is going on, if there was an update that may have glitches, but I can no longer add text without it glitching and putting the cursor back into my words. I tried to do separate lines of words as I'm trying to make a menu for my business and am not able to do so as it jumps around and will not allow me to put more that two rows of wording. I am very disappointed in this as I pay monthly for the pro version as I run 2 businesses and this app helps with advertising."
"Initially, I gave it a 4 star but the last couple of weeks, the app has been glitching really bad. The text box is impossible to use, the lines in the text box expand by themselves, and it freezes. Doc feature freezes. It's impossible to use."
"I used to love canva, but lately, it is just super glitchy. They make it really hard to contact someone about your issues. The link to contact canva on the app and website don't work and the email listed in the playstore auto returns with an email stating they don't read that email and links you back to the section that doesn't work. When editing texts, each click in the box produces an astronomical amount of spacing between lines,and each attempt just adds more. It's really frustrating."
"Absolutely love this app! I use it constantly. However, in the last couple months it's gotten very buggy. One major one that is exceptionally common: 1. Text color is static. I can see font changes, and I can change colors, but the text remains either white or black outlined in white (side note: I would love to have more text effects options, such as outlining and shadowing text!). In order to check the color of the text, i actually have to save the graphic and open it on my phone."
"I want to like it. I want to like it so badly. The desktop version is fine, but the app is just not user friendly. Adding music is clunky and unintuitive, and good luck moving the audio files or adjusting volume or fading the audio out. Adding photos requires a significant amount of clicking and dragging, hard on a phone. The bones are there and I really appreciate Canva making the effort, especially its free version, but I wouldn't pay money for this until some of the wrinkles are ironed out."
"Love the new features being added like the format painter and the color picker, but I'm not sure what has happened with the all around functionality. The mobile app is almost useless. I have to ""guess"" on the alignment and sizing of my designs before posting. I end up editing the same file several times just to get what I am seeing on my screen to reflect what is actually saved and downloaded. What is going on? It also keeps freezing the editor because it can't sync up. Help!"
"What happen? This software was perfect. I never had an issue with graphics ... until today. I'm on an android and today when I tried to use it, I can't even insert a graphic. It is there (outline of the box), but you cannot see it. The updated version doesnt work. Before when you use it, there was no issues. UPDATE: I installed and re-installed. It appears Canva might be working again."
I'm a Pro member and the app wouldn't download the video when my content has a video or 2 and it is too long (45 seconds +). I love their templates and designs. It will just not completing the download. At first I tried to make my content shorter and less video uploads or shorter video. It just still not downloading when I still have their music audio add to it. I ended up keeping all my contents and removing their audio and it seem to be working so far. Still exploring. Does anyone has any suggestions? I would love to keep their audio music in the video to make it interesting if I can.
"I have created 1 video for mobile, twice. I had to pay for the music, or rather one song and one sound effect; twice. The sound effect didn't play at the end of the saved version resulting in a ruined video that is useless to me. The version played while in the Canva app is what I want, but when I download it, it doesn't save correctly. What could be malfunctioning? Also, too expensive to use!!"
"I have been using this app for quite some time while loving it. The past few attempts I've been a complete waste of time. Something buggy happening. once you create an image and save it it looks fine until you go to post it. Upon posting it changes size, font and location on the page. I uninstalled and reinstalled hoping to fix it with no success. 😔"
"PC version is great and worth it. The app constantly brings me back to my designs page when I try to open something to edit the background color. Maybe more of an issue if there are a lot of pages? Still, very annoying and didn't help me make a dent in time-consuming edits on-the-go. I also wish you could change something like the background color on all pages at once."
"Price for year is to much. Free templates etc are not free. They say they are but once you want to save it tells you it has some pro elements. Is a nice app but overpriced and free version is not truly free. Also, when downloading your video the sound is delayed as well as the music. Imagine overpaying and things like this happening. Also, for a video to download it takes a lot of time."
"Maybe I'm doing something wrong here, but after using the free version for a while, I decided to signed up the free trial upgrade and was really impressed with the phone app. But once I got on the computer to do some heavy editing, I found even more features that I like, but on top of $13 per month, you charge $1 EACH for most of the graphics I want to use! That's too much. Tell me this is a glitch."
"Having so many issues lately. My downloaded designs are completely different from what I see in canva. Word sizes are different, placement will be way off or even cut out of the design entirely. And my mobile app changed to desktop style somehow and I cannot change it back. It is SO DIFFICULT to use on my phone now! I'm extremely frustrated, it used to be so easy!"
"Free version is very limited. The images can't even be filtered by ""free"" vs ""pro"" without having the pro version. It also did not size my text correctly for instagram, the text was off the edge of the image when I went to post it. I had to resize it several times. It is also very hard to go back to ""home"" after saving the image if you do not click ""go to home"". There should be a home button, when is there ever not a home button?"
"Extremely limited design app. Pros: May work in a pinch or as a very simple option for mainstream users. Includes access to hundreds of free clipart images. Cons: Quality is grainy or blurry at best regardless of the file type you select. No option to flip images vertically or horizontally. No option to group items together within a single layout for ease of repositioning. Several preset shapes allow user to resize the shape at existing ratio, but do not allow stretching for longer/taller shape."
"I love the app. But I'm also REALLY frustrated that I'm paying money to use an editor that won't download my basic videos LESS than 10 min. No, they don't have hundreds of filters in them and my Wifi is a 100%. I'll also get videos with chopped up chunks of the clips. I've sent you a message before and you just told me it was my fault for those reasons above. It's not. I used to be able to download my videos until a month ago. Haven't been able to get any of my creations off Canva."
"I like it, but it's trash at the same time. Mostly trash. Because I cannot use this app without it glitching and I'm using a very expensive phone that is ment to stay good for crying out loud! Please, just fix this. And then I'll give it 5 stars. But to be nice I'll tell the good parts. There are many options of templates, elements, texts, and colors, plus if you don't have pro then just deal with the watermark, I mean. I can deal with it."
"I've used Canva online for many years now, and was a major fan at first. As it has continued to increase its persistent fee structure online though, it's been a major turn off. The app is EVEN MORE obnoxious about it. It's virtually impossible to figure out what graphics/images are free, and its editing features are limited and hard to navigate - especially the cropping/resizing tools. The free font selection has diminished tremendously (ironic considering the ever increasing availability of free fonts online).   Overall just a massive cash-grab at this point.   The saving/syncing is also finicky - opening certain designs I've started online in app then creates issues with the design in a web browser, so I really can't use it cross platform.  I'd give it a 1 star but if you're just using its free templates, it does have a wide selection of those. Generally though, a waste of time and phone space. There are other, better apps out there that aren't just nickel and diming everything you do.  Incredibly disappointed in the direction Canva has elected to go."
"I used to love canva a lot before the new update. Now it's super glitchy. I mean, the app does look better, but whenever I create a bookcover, the finished product is different after I save and exit the screen. For instance, I'll save text a certain way, download it, and exit. In my gallery, the text is positioned differently than how I saved it. I'm not sure if anyone else is experiencing this, but it can be really frustrating at times."
"Really glitchy since the update. Been using pro for over a year and never had this many issues. Text box is slow to respond to adjustments in size, randomly turns, deletes text, grabs things I didn't touch and moves them... It's really frustrating because I use this when designing logos and business cards for customers... It's easiest for resizing the images I create in procreate and they be accurate and a high resolution... Now I'm screaming at it more than I'm getting anything done with it."
"I used to love working with this app. It truly was the best. Lately, it's been 5 thumbs down. I came here to read reviews to see if people were experiencing the same problems. It seems we are. I've lost pay because I can't finish projects. Out of nowhere my cursor jumps so many spaces between lines, so many that there is nothing on my screen. There is no way to fix this on my end. I hope Canva fixes this issue. For now, I will be canceling my PRO subscription."
"I love this app. I've created so many beautifully designed products on this app. The graphics and digital capabilities are aligned to others in the market which is great. My major issues: the timings of animations still has a long ways to go - no matter how you adjust speeds, what animations you choose, the animations occur virtually simultaneously. There needs to be an update that allows you to stagger or schedule animations in videos so things aren't playing right on top of each other."
"Used to love this app, but lately it has become more of a burden than a useful tool for my business. I'm finding that it crashes more frequently, continuously does not upload photos, will not save projects or even download them, etc. So many issues to list them all. I even dropped the pro version and went back to the free version as I finding myself using different apps because of these issues."
over-complicated with 101 things I don't need and fails to answer the simple question how do I upload a video. I just want an hour trying to get one to work it would play for 5 seconds and then go white with no explanation it's not intuitive which is sad because they have great editing software but I can't get to it. shorter version I'm sure the Corvette runs great but the salesman locked us out of the car so we can't test drive it. Focus on the basics first guys. How does the user upload
"The app doesn't work quite as well as the web page does for designing a resume. The app is real fidgety. Even though there is a back button, if it auto saves there is no way to go back further on a made mistake. I suggest using this companies web page for editing text or making adjustments to designs. The app also will not let me change the format from .pnp to .zip."
"What is happening with this app? I've been using it for a while now, and loving it...but since my phone updated...every time I try to type something for a project, the words go all crazy. The cursor jumps around on the page, it adds a ton of spaces, and it seems like it's possessed. If I'm typing something shorter, I can generally do it quickly enough to make it work, but if it's longer than a sentence, I can't do it anymore. Either way...it's super frustrating! Please help."
"I'm having the same text box issued everyone else is having. While editing a text box, spacing will be added and then cause the text box to become very large and text get small. Glad this isn't just me. It is very annoying. I love the app and it is very user-friendly. Works great for my business. Please fix so I can go back to using this app."
"Wanted back and white line art backgrounds. Some pictures you can change the colors to black and white and some you can't, got to spend time to find out if it's changeable, and if you want to find a black and white pattern you don't have to change for a background those are mostly premium. Was hoping to save time rather than drawing all my backgrounds myself. Saved nothing."
"Uaeful, but inexplicably uses ""Saving"" wait screens when it saves to your phone instantly. If you choose to save your design for upload, it will throw up a ""Saving"" animation that you can sometimes be stuck on endlessly. But if you click the save button and immediately go to your photos, there it is. The ""Saving"" window serves absolutely no purpose or it does something on the back end that has zero benefit to the end user. Either way, it's a stupid and annoying issue."
"With the Pro account, there should be a way to sort by Pro to view all the templates, features, fonts, elements, photos, background, etc available for Pro. If I'm paying for Pro, I want to use those options and I don't want to search through all the free to get to the Pro options. it would also be great to give the photos, backgrounds, and elements a title to make it easy to find them again. Basically the overall Pro experience should be enhanced more."
"Was considering upgrading to the pro version, having remembered it only cost $4/month, but now seeing they raised the monthly rate to $13 dollars... No thank you! I already have an Adobe cloud subscription for all their apps, not worth the money. I can justify $4 a month just to have something for ""ease of use,"" when I don't feel like starting a project in Photoshop, but not the $13."
"Since the recent update I am not able to use Canva as smooth as I did. Very glitchy. Takes a while to load and then all the buttons are invisible to see (like the duplicate button or the flip buttons) and since Ive used it before and know where the buttons are, if I click on the button, this huge white block covers half of the project, so I cannot see if I am changing the pic correctly or if i like the change. There is more, please fix."
"Very limited in regard to what I was looking for. I needed a simple horizontal history timeline but most of the templates are verticle, and the ones that do go horizontal are so overdone and gaudy that it's difficult to even get started. Not user friendly and there doesn't seem to be a way to switch from phone to pc on a project"
Whats up with the error in the text box?! Everytime you try to edit the text it moves the text out of the box or automatically adds in all of this spacing that you can't even edit it on the app. Came to see if I was the only that had this issue and I'm not alone. Yall need to get it together or alot of people including myself will be closing out their accounts!
"The app is having issues right now. I'm here checking to see if it needs to be updated. Every time I try to add or modify text it jumps around and makes the box super big, adds letters, puts my cursor in random spots. It has bugs and needs to be fixed. Please create an update so I can get back to using it as my go-to for creating graphics for my business."
"There are so many options to choose from for just about any project you can think up.. however, when it was time for me to add a certain image/ icon/vector to my business card, I couldn't find it and it was very difficult to upload from another app or site.. Also, when it came time to print, it was via their site so I couldnt print my own cards. but overall it was a better experience than most apps with like content."
"Using for logo design: The app and Web versions are very different. The app doesn't refresh the view of your new designs in a timely manner. But, the thing which frustrates me most is twice now, I have designed a logo and both times it has downloaded with errors. With my first one, on the final version, an illustration downloaded much larger than I designed. With my second one, when I downloaded the final version, part of an illustration shows a color which isn't part of my design."
"Too many issues bouncing between the app and the web. Sometimes designs aren't saved, even after hitting the save button. This applies to web and app. Frequently downloading from the app is an issue. Customer service/tech takes quite a while to get back to you. Perhaps they've grown too fast, but it makes for a mediocre user experience."
I love using Canva for all my social media content and other business graphics. However the last month the app has been glitch city! Every time I go to type anything in a text box it glitches and either adds a bunch or spaces or will randomly delete text. I don't have this issue with the app on my iPad only on Samsung. Not being able to use the app on my phone is extremely frustrating. I hope you guys can fix this soon. Because I'd much rather give a higher star rating.
"Was the absolute best. I used it for my business but now it glitches so much. There is an issue with the text box. Whenever I type in it, it creates spaces automatically, down to beyond the bottom of the page. I try to back space & it creates the spaces while I'm doing it. I make sure the app is up to date to ensure it's working on the latest version. I've tried to Uninstall & reinstall but no luck. I can't keep fighting with this. I don't even create custom posts for my business anymore. Fix"
"Love the App, But, everytime I use it, no matter what device I use, it freezes and I have to either go to the home page or exit completely. Super inconvenient, especially when I pay for the Pro version. If this isn't fixed soon, I will have to cancel that subscription and find another platform to use. This is used for my small business, nor do I have any patience for incompetence from any app. At least I could go a few minutes without an issue but now it's immediate, can't do anything, freezes"
"Even when deleting a failed template and backing out, EVERY single template gets saved anyway. Its frustrating having to delete stuff twice. Also, there is no function to simply choose a photo or video and draw on it. Instead I have to choose from 100 different templates that force me to crop my video...Lame. The resulting video is also heavily degraded in quality. So pretty much useless for anything video related."
"This is a pretty good app. I use it for YouTubs thumbnails all the time, and I use the illustrations a lot. My problem is that recently, the coin stack that showed you what was free to use disappeared and now only tells me I've used pro illustrations when I go to download, after I'm already content with a design. And then if I try to sort by free, it takes me to a free trial. I shouldn't have to pay just to sort. This app is costing me a lot of time, and it used to be one of my favorites. :("
"The app is so easy to use, and I found myself loving it at first. I made many designs and edits with the app but upon looking in my gallery after downloading the works, I realized that the works, all including some sort of gif, came out all buggy and glitched. The font color's not even close to the ones I chose. Though when I download them as images they're fine? That makes no sense. I don't know if that's just a problem with my phone, but it's extremely irritating. Fix this, please?"
"In 2019, when I first downloaded this app, I loved it. Even the free version was helpful for creating unique and stylish social media posts. I used this app exclusively. However, after the updates in 2021, it's been awful. Not as user friendly as it used to be and lots of kinks to where sometimes I can't even view my creation on the screen. So sad that an app I've relied on for years is going to the uninstall trash."
"I loved the app before the update. The app sometimes takes forever to load now when you open it. The feature to be able to star or add a template to your favorites is gone. I had so many templates saved which have now disappeared. When I try to edit a template and add something, the tools box blocks the entire template. The mobile app was once easier to use than the desktop version and now they're about the same. I'm paying a $13 monthly subscription and considering canceling now. Change it back"
"I used to like the app, but I don't like when using the free version, the update doesn't show you which items you have to pay for. It used to tell you if elements, graphics, etc. were pro items but now you have to click on the image and you'll see a watermark if it's a Pro item. So now you send most your time selecting and deleting items to see if you're able to use them. It's frustrating! Why offer a free version if you make it almost impossible to use?"
"Pro: Good app with some nice helpful features like ability to add different elements, audio, stickers, etc., but far from perfect. Needs work. Cons: App is slow with frequent crashes & glitches, lot of the designs are repetitive. Missing key stickers. Items under each tab are poorly organized. Each addable item needs more ability to customize (especially text based ones). Would be nice to be able to choose download folder and/or set default logo/watermark for branding purposes. Hope to improve."
I loved the app however here lately I have been having issues with it crashing and not loading up my DESIGNS. I been having to use the computer in order to login and work on my logo. Very frustrating considering I am in the business of making custom stationary and. A lot of time I work on clients stationary when I am on the go. This was going on after I installed the update. I don't think this is right especially when I pay 12.99 a month for subscription and I am having to really be inconvience.
"glitches out pretty often. i've had it freeze and crash at least three times. it's also a pain that the best fonts are locked under a pay wall, and annoying that whenever i save an image i get like three pop ups to share and to upgrade to canva pro. plus, recently, sometimes when i try to save something, it says that it's been edited on another device and then boots me from editing that imagw, then won't load again. it's okay to use on a laptop, but the app sucks."
"The app used to be great until it took on the web-browser version of itself. Now, it's not equipped for phone screens, the actual thing you're creating is extremely small in comparison to the menu tools, etc. The new interface took away the app-like type of it, might as well just use the in-browser version."
"I'm having to change my rating...even though I absolutely love Canva and use it all the time. Unfortunately there are just too many bugs. Every day I encounter a problem where it all of a sudden just stops working, like I can't open up the ""+"" button, I can't select anything, but am still scrolling the page. Please developers, PLEASE fix your app...I've been forced to use Adobe's creative cloud design app (similar to Canva) due to not being able to finish my designs cuz of bugs on the app. :("
"Really frustrating recently. I'm writing this after loosing 7 graphics I was working on. I closed the app and when I went back into it, hours of work were gone. It has not been working right on my phone for the last month or two, and to download anything I have to close it, go to my laptop, download it there and send it to my phone. I have the pro subscription but loosing my work today has me looking for alternatives."
"App looks really nice but it took too long to get to the one feature I needed to use just once (resize a single image) AND it required me to login with an account (Google, FB, e-mail, etc.) which I found to be a superfluous hinderance. If you're looking to simply resize a single image or two and then never use the app again, I wouldn't recommend this. It takes too long to get to the point."
"Horrible update and now useless on mobile app. I use this app a lot and the old version was a lot better and now can't go back. I've even tried downloading from apx files and still same version, it sucks! This needs to be fixed asap! Mobile app is now the same as desktop version and horrible to work with. Uploading pictures is a pain to say the least, if you can even get them to load due to changes in type of file it is. Resizing and placement doesn't work. Much harder to edit now overall."
"Glitchy!! When I'm editing or adding text, the cursor begins to add lines as if I'm pressing the enter button. Sometimes the text boxes get so large that some of my text completely disappears from my flyers, and I have to press the undo button to fix the issue...as the app is adding lines, I'm deleting them. It turns into a race, I delete one line and canva adds two then four then 10!! This app is becoming nightmarish. Please advise."
"The app freezes way too much for a 12.99 monthly subscription. I am constantly loosing work. There are a lot of little features on ipad that don't work as well. An example is editing after the background remover you can only zoom into the picture from one vantage point, not being able to move around and see the certain parta zoomed in makes the feature useless. It's fine for a free app but NOT with money"
"While trying to add my text, it spontaneously seems to insert extra paragraphs, adding more and more space until it dips WAY below the alloted box. I have to delete everything and start over. I learned to type it up first in my notepad and then paste the text into into this app. Unnecessary extra step. If I'm not quick enough, it'll start doing that nonsense again. Not good."
Sometimes my graphics don't download properly. Some elements (animated pictures and design elements) just dissappear from the story. The app sometimes change the type of font I have chosen or just changes the format. I had to install and reinstall the app multiple times on my new phone. Customer service responded last time 2 weeks after the technical issue. The mobile version it's not practical. It needs to be fixed soon!
Everything was fine until it wasn't. I got the hang of it quick but the biggest issue is when I try to download a creation the final product has a bunch of glitches that weren't there when editing. When asking support I got 2 messages from actual people and then after that the rest was bots asking if the issue was resolved even though I never got responses when talking to those 2 people. Horrible customer service and I hope I don't get charged again after my service is done!
"Everything is great about this app except 1 thing....you cannot remove backgrounds of pictures while in the app like you can on a computer/laptop. That sucks because that's a BIG reason why I use canva. I love it when I'm stationary, but I need that feature when I'm on the go and have inspiration to create. When I'm able to do that then I'll change my star rating."
"Cool and large variety of pre-designed templates. No good for doing anything on your own. I couldn't even make a simple photo collage because it didn't offer a grid template without other design elements. i couldnt upload more than one of my photos on a blank template. Or if there is a way to do it, the interface is very non user friendly. Frustrating waste of time."
"Every time I try to make a new text box, there is an error where it keeps adding space in the text box and it will eventually freeze the screen and I have to completely shut down the app and try again. But the same thing keeps happening. Please fix this glitch so I can keep making my designs. Thank you."
"So buggy, had to uninstall. The app crashes constantly, but most annoying of all - it logs me out of our business account every time it closes. So, every time I need to use it, I have to go dig up the password (doesn't seem to support Samsung Pass), interrupt my work flow, and hope I didn't fat-thumb a single key... Just so I can get what is supposed to be a quick design up. Not worth it."
"used to love this app for years. created so many mockups with ease and great quality. now that you've redesigned the user interface with your recent update (which I've tried hard to adjust to for months now) it is pretty much unusable. layers of images disappear, positioning any element is often like pulling teeth. I don't know why so many apps and other online services force a garbage update on loyal supporters without bothering to test and perfect the new system, ruining what made you great."
"It advertises free and gets you in, but I'd rather pay 10 dollars (the comparable price on Vista print) than deal with customizing on their interface. It was a huge pain in the ass to try and do something simple like resizing a photo for a business flyer. Their templates are almost exactly the same but the customization interface is crappy"
"This app used to be great. but after their whole redesign ""2.0"" months ago, it's been dysfunctional on both my android phone app, and my iPad pro. It often gives me errors. Today's particular issue has been reverting changes halfway including color, font, spacing, and alignments. The most annoying issue is my design can look fine but after it's saved, the saved image has errors of graphics being misplaced and font running off the edge. Gonna start looking for a replacement app unfortunately."
"What happened to canva? I am a loyal Canva Pro subscriber and user. But the app has become literally useless. As others have said the glitches make it Impossible to create a post. For example a text Box adds endless returns, the box is made infinitely long and cannot be fixed in the app. Each time I have to log into the site later to fix my doc--making the app useless. Get rid of it or bring back the old one."
"What a great platform and great app. I've used it a lot over the past several years. It's sad to see that an app and platform would just settle for ""good enough"". To not be able to delete items in bulk from the trash just seems lazy. Why have the ability to send items to the trash in bulk but not compmetely delete in bulk. Instead you have to delete the items one by one. So now we have multiple steps to completely delete anything within the platform. Thanks for making me have to more!"
"Everything was fine until after I canceled the canva pro free trial (which I don't need at the moment). For some reason I no longer have the option of selecting to only view free items. Everytime I try to filter, it takes me to a Canva pro free trial page. It seems like I'm being forced to view thousands of images that are only available for purchase or pro JUST to make me spend money. My experience using this app has become unnecessarily tedious because of this."
Was using the app immensely but it cant handle some of the videos and gets stuck frequently. Sometimes it doesnt download the finished templates or videos and pixelates in the middle of the processed video. Its all over the place and isnt able to keep up when or if you use it to generate videos as a primary or subsidiary way of income. Needs work.
"I have the pro version. I like what the app is supposed to do it just never works for some reason. I create a post and try to save it and all it says is ""making the magic happen"" then sticks every time and never saves. Also doesn't work when I try to connect to my social media. Gave it a 2nd try and I'm cancelling for the 2nd time!"
Mobile is not the same as desktop. This app has a fraction of the functionality of the desktop app. The update didn't help. I use Canva Pro for my desktop and hoped I could boost productivity on the go with the app. No go. Can't size graphics. Can't import with transparency. Every time I open a project it creates a copy cluttering up my folders. It's a frustrating mess!
"The new update sucks!!!!!! Why did you have to change a perfect app?! This was my favorite photo editing app but now not only is it harder to search for what I need, harder to find the style after I selected the post size but its so difficult to navigate the extremely different interface within the app. It's so very different than the previous version. I would love the old version of the app before this horrible update. This sucks man!!! I'm going to moss this app as I find something else now..."
The app all the sudden will not load on my phone. I switch to wifi and try at different places. It always says connection lost. Works fine on my laptop so this must be a phone app issue. I'm a pro user and need to work on the go abd this is a huge inconvience especially since I am paying for this service. It used to work just fine.
"It was awesome at first. I actually decided to pay the monthly subscription in order to use the background remover feature that works great. Unfortunately this app has been glitching for days now. Whenever I hit the edit text option, the screen goes blank. I'm now behind several days of posting on my social media. Not a happy paying customer"
Very frustrating to use. Edits made don't always show up in the working design until I have back out of the design and then click back in to force an update. Adding solid background shapes for text sitting over an image is a nightmare. (Why not give the option of adding a background color in the text editor?) Trying to align text or shapes to each other is painstaking and never comes out right b/c they don't snap to each other.
"I really love this app and the features but I pay for the Pro subscription and the app constantly crashes and glitches. Every time I edit an image, the app stalls. It's super frustrating. The time it takes to edit one image is 10x longer than it should be, with all the glitching and crashing. When you're paying to use an app, it should not be this difficult or unreliable!"
"I used to love this app. Used it for everything because even in the free version it had excellent variety. But now, the app completely refuses to open if I'm on wifi. I thought it was a mobile problem, so I tried on my computer as well, but even then it wasnt opening (can't even access their help page). It's like the app and website only work if I'm using data... so disappointed, I hope they fix it soon cause it's pointless for it to only work when you're using data"
"App is great for the most part, though mostly because it's mainstream. Customer service sucks and doesn't help in any real capacity when issues arise, and I occasionally experience glitches such as app getting frozen on one chat, my account disappearing for no reason, &c. Layout is probably the best thing about it since it's easy to navigate. Edit: And in response, I did submit a support ticket. The response I got was completely unrelated to my issue."
"My default profile picture disappears in chats. When I send a message, it does not show in the chat until I close the app and open it again. I don't get notifications even when all settings are on and permitted. I cannot reply through the Discord notifications. Reinstalling seems to address some of these issues. Has been happening for multiple updates."
"EDIT: The new mobile UI is atrocious. Cancel Nitro. The once lightweight, reliable client, is starting to become bloated with unnecessary features, and while intermittent and brief, is having consistent issues, specifically on voice and video. The Username 'evolution' is an unforced error that is unfortunate and takes one of the best things about discord away. Discord was built upon being yourself, it's sad to see it drifting away from being itself and being 'kinda like other apps.'"
"It's been getting harder to use each update. I loved it because it connected me to my friends, but it's becoming very unfriendly towards its users. The latest update forces you to disconnect from a call after 3 minutes alone, even if you don't want to, and it is extremely frustrating/annoying. It claims that this is to save bandwidth, but it should absolutely be an OPTION not a REQUIREMENT. I honestly only gave it 2 stars because it connects me to my friends. Otherwise it would have been a 1."
"I haven't had any issues with discord mobile until the last two updates. Absolutely love the app as a whole, but when I click to change to a different server or to DMs, it doesn't switch visually, and I have to restart discord. Also been having issues with volume in voice calls. I've messed with the settings and reset them and got better mics and headphones, but it always seems to putz out."
"I'm not sure how this managed to happen but the chats have a tendency to break and lag. If I switch from one server to another, the previous server's messages will still show up no matter where I go. Not to mention the lag that can happen when typing where it'll break your phone keyboard for a solid twenty seconds and not pull it back up. Don't even get me started on the changes to usernames that's gonna be implemented eventually. The current username system is working perfectly fine."
"The voice message feature feels like it was rolled out far too prematurely, and is extremely glitchy, even on reliable and fast home wifi. The app won't even send my voice messages if I am on my data, even with full service it won't even try and will repeatedly give me an error message even after deleted, I still get the notifications days later. The app itself is fine, I guess, but it's cool features only work like 60% of the time. I wish it was better."
"No longer connects voice/video chats after last update, just rings and then stays on ""connecting"" even after 20 minutes. Everything about my phone is up to date, and I've even gone so far as to change dns settings and all that fun stuff (just in case). Tried the app on a different device, a tablet, and both are Samsung, and had the same issues. I can connect just fine on my pc. App worked perfectly before the update."
"As many others have stated, the most recent update has ruined the VC feature. Cannot connect to voice channels at all. It will show me in the channel, but it just says ""connecting"" permanently and I can't hear anyone, and they can't hear me. I've already contacted support and they have been extremely unhelpful, blaming me for the issue despite the fact that it is obviously the app. Please fix this broken app."
"This App used to be very good for communicating back and forth. It had become my main texting platform, but now it's hardly usable. What good is a messaging app that can't even notify you when you have a message? It's not just me that isn't getting notifications and losing messages but every user I communicate with on this platform. Discord, please stop getting progressively worse. Every update feels like you're trying to drive away your user base. If you're new to Discord don't bother."
"The app has been buggy for months. You often have to close and reopen it to get messages to display. I've tried messaging on Twitter, and I was told to uninstall and reinstall the app; that didn't help. This combined with the recent announcement of the creation of ""usernames"" (rather than our name with the # and numbers) really makes me wonder if Discord is really trying to continue delivering the service we've had all these years, or if it's just about money to them now like everyone else."
"Pretty frustrated. This app is super buggy on my phone. Won't switch between channels or conversations. Have to close the app & reopen to switch. When I check the ""what's new"" section, it says my client is out of date and to update. I have no way to do that. Google play store says it's updated. I uninstalled/reinstalled it.. same issues & message. I'd avoid using this app if it weren't the only way to communicate with some of my friends. I hate it. Please fix this."
"Always has missing messages! You get the notification in the bar and it has the message there, but when you open the app, there are no new messages. It's very annoying because you cannot see them to answer or view the attachments. It also often flags images as inappropriate and not send them, when they are not."
"I love this app. It's a great place to meet friends and stay in touch. That being said, the challenge I am having with Discord right now is very annoying. It continues to make the sound like someone has joined the video call when no one has every 15-20 seconds. I also can not turn on video. I've checked my setting, and all I can see is audio solutions. I've deleted and re-downloaded the app, and it is still an issue."
"Been using the app for a bit and it's been working fine, however recently it's been doing this thing where I open the app and can only see one channel on my server. My server has 16. I either have to log out, delete a role, or uninstall and reinstall in order to view all the channels again. It's not my internet because it did the same thing when I was connected to 3 different WiFis. And it's not my phone because there were no changes to my phone in-between the time it started happening."
"I've been using Discord for YEARS now and I've never seen it hit such low quality. It's still easy to navigate but it's CONSTANTLY buggy and breaking making it nearly unbearable to use. Menu's disappear, images are out of frame, even when on a stable network the ""connecting..."" stays, calls lag, video quality in calls is awful no matter how good the wifi or camera, the security breach of people stealing your info is easy, and tons of other issues even with latest updates. It gets worse everyday"
The app is bugging out especially when someone else turns there camera on it says unstable connection under their profile picture and glitches call constantly. I've never had a problem with this before but it started a few days ago and I've un installed and re installed a few times and it still bugs out. I checked if it needs to be updated but there's no update needed. Please fix this problem. It's even happening for a couple of my friends also.
"Seems like with every update, the performance of this app continues to get worse. Constantly having to close the app and reopen it, pictures and gifs go blank/missing, search crashes, profile avatars/pictures disappear, notifications don't work properly, etc. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app so many times and it doesn't help."
"I love using discord and have been for years, but for the past month or so the app has been glitchy as hell. It gets stuck on one conversation, won't even display new messages, and you have to close out to fix it every five minutes. This is the longest I've ever seen such a huge bug go unfixed, and combined with the awful new username system, it looks like everything is going down hill."
"Buggy, though not as much as it used to be. Can't send files as replies anymore, as in it'll send the file, not as a reply. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted my device multiple times... Nothing fixes it, and it's only on mobile. Is it only to encourage thread usage, or is it just a bug? This is the only main thing I've noticed as of now."
"Having used this app actively since 2019, I can vouche it's been in a steady horrendous decline. Despite all manner of restart/install, force close, cache clear, wifi or data- I can't get away from ""CONNECTING..."". Images, gifs, emotes and often pfp no longer load. Channels disappear or are incorrectly displayed. Sometimes DM are 'read-only mode'? Voice/video call are substantially lower quality, if they are able to connect. Just, disappointed? This is my primary means of contact. :("
"The android app has gone so far downhill, it isn't even funny. These recent (honestly completely unnecessary) updates have ruined the app completely to the point it's barely usable. The menus are completely messed up, they bug out so often, performance is horrible, the battery drainage has never been this bad with discord, the app freezes constantly during voice calls, and don't even get me started on the horrible VC quality. Discord, PLEASE fix this app, we're all BEGGING you"
"This app has been getting worse with each update ever since they merged the Android version with the iOS version. It's clearly not capable of handling code written with iOS in mind, as it has a tendency to auto-close the emoji menu, get locked on a message and refuse to scroll or automatically cancel a reply, leaving your post without context. Only rebooting the app temporarily fixes it; reinstalling doesn't stop any of this. Please separate the versions again, the Android app is suffering."
"The app is decent but as previous reviews mentioned, connectivity has become an ongoing issue. I also get this weird bug where uploaded pics as well as any picture media appear too big and out of the frame and the hold menu for replies and reactions appears as a narrow bar in the middle of the screen. It won't resolve until I force stop and re-open the app (I would provide a screenshot if I could). It's annoying."
"Been happening for awhile, but I don't receive notifications at all on my phone. I have it enabled from my settings, in the app, they just don't show up. The chats aren't muted, so I'm really just not sure why it won't work. The updates sort of fix it for a day or two and it just goes back to doing it again. Really frustrating having an app dedicated to chats and it can't even send notifications."
"Was good, not anymore. Every update has consistently been making the UI worse and worse. For example, I can no longer highlight text and spoiler it (or other options) by pressing the ""spoiler"" button. I now have to memorize how to do every one of those manually. Member names no longer change color immediately as well, plus a bunch of other stuff I don't have the word count to explain. If you are using this, immediately turn off auto-update. Clearly they're treating updates as a free beta test"
"The voice chat buttons confuse me, I cannot tell if my mic is on or off. Also, the video and gif player is messed up. Whenever I click on a video, it doesn't enlarge completely. It just pops up to the enlarge screen while still keeping its previous size. And gifs that were shared, like gifs of clips from twitch, don't play at all. It is annoying to deal with. If those issues were solved, I would gladly give this 5 stars."
"I usually love Discord. I use it every day. But lately, the new updates have been messing with it a lot. I don't get any notifications while I'm on my phone. I've deleted and reinstalled, I've logged out, and I've deleted my data/cache. it works for a little bit, and then it stops within a message or two. it's infuriating. I dont know what else to do."
"Like another veteran user, I'm ALSO having RTC connection issues. Whenever I try to join a server's VC channel, all it does is keep me in ""connecting"" purgatory until it eventually times out with a ""disconnected"" notification. I've tried logging out and logging back in, uninstalling and reinstalling the app on my mobile, even reseting my wifi router. I hate what's been done in these recent updates. Talk is in the name, but I haven't been able to do that recently. When will this be fixed?"
"I made a second account, so I have two now, my first account hasn't updated to the new layout yet, but the second account has. The layout is overall terrible, it's not easy to use like the original for mobile. Another downside is that the servers I put in my folders no longer open with my second account and I can't see their channels. I use discord so much, I really enjoy it, but this new update is terrible. I have tried closing the app and restarting my phone, but nothing."
"Just got a new phone and my discord had updated due to that. Since then the app has run really slowly in terms of messages appearing on the screen and I have had issues where the image of one server chat is stuck on my screen even when I try to go to another chat. I also noticed that the react panel in which you can react, reply etc. Is cut from my screen only showing a sliver of the whole panel making the experience difficult. The same goes with images sent. Pls oh pls fix!"
"Great app but whenever I'm trying to read past messages, I keep getting brought back down near the bottom even when I do not use the auto scroll. There are times where I don't have my hands anywhere near my screen and it will still bring me back down. I have tried multiple different times to fix it but nothing is working. This didn't happen before the recent update. Edit: it been fixed. Thank you for your time, person who is doing the responding."
Ok for the most part but recently I've been having this issue where I'll open the app and only 1 channel in the server I'm in is showing. The rest are randomly gone. Uninnstalling & reinstalling the app seems to fix the issue but lately I've been having to do this every couple of days and it's become frustrating & annoying. Not sure why it keeps doing this.
"Both my husband and I are now experiencing issues with random disconnection in full WiFi. Just now switching channels would go blank and get stuck ""Connecting..."" You need a hotfix badly. Btw, I tried setting device DNS to Google and it's screwing with my wifi repeater while browsing. This is not a fix. And it happens everywhere, not just at home."
"Not sure what they broke but for several days now it isn't loading messages properly. The notification shows the message but when I go into the app it just hangs on an older message and changing channels and servers does nothing. Doesn't display ""connecting"" on the top so not a connection issue deleting cache seems to get it to load properly."
Discord as a whole has been extremely unreliable. Either stuck in a connecting loop on mobile or unable to use the app for more than 30 minutes because it'll crash if I even load a gif. As for the connection issues. They only resolve if I turn on a VPN. WHICH is absolutely stupid... Discord will work perfectly fine on both desktop and browsers but simply won't on mobile. Connecting via mobile browsers also works with zero issues. So why won't the app Please fix this it's been almost 6 months....
"Discord on Android is pretty useful in itself. But what isn't useful is the app CONSTANTLY suffers from connection problems. No matter how fast your internet is. Almost every time I open the app while it was previously running, nothing loads at all for a good 10 seconds to a full minute. 10 seconds may not seem much, but the PC app can boot up, and load everything in 5 seconds or less. Considering how fast devices are these days, this is unacceptable. Please fix your connection problems."
"Love this platform but every UI update has been getting worse and worse. I've also experienced a lot more issues with menus and the app just not loading as of late (I have to open and close it to get it to work). Non-optional image compression on mobile has been a major downer too, and a lot of other ""behind the scenes"" changes have done nothing but bad things to the app's usability."
"Latest update is extremely buggy. If I switch apps and then return to the open window, channels and the server browser won't load correctly and I have to fully close the app and reopen it, and even then there's only a chance it will load properly. If it doesn't, I have to close and repeat until it works. This happens regardless of network, since I've seen the devs responding asking about it. Prior versions of the app were more stable, so I don't know why they decided to ruin this one."
"Latest update is a bit annoying. Have to scroll down to get things to mark as read, even if you're already scrolled all the way down. Keyboard keeps popping up for seemingly no reason. It otherwise works fine but it is a bit annoying. To add to this, now on the latest version it additionally doesn't show people's picture if they have the default Discord profile picture. Clearing cache and storage for the app restores functionality for a brief period of time. App has gone downhill."
"I've used this app for years. Let me say, the communication is great and there are many cool, fun features that add to the experience; however, my largest gripe with this app is the excessive changing of user interface. The UI is updated so frequently that it makes the app unenjoyable once you've finally gotten used to a specific feature. In fact, the developers should focus more on bugs with the software rather than minor changes in design which provide no improvement for the app in any regard."
"Lost another star. Discord is awesome. The Discord app on android is complete garbage. A buggy trash heap that requires me to close and reopen the app constantly just for basic functionality. Connection loop, the reaction/edit/copy menu for tapping and holding a message gets reduced to a non-functional sliver in the middle of the screen randomly, I sometimes have to close and reopen the app just to switch channels. I've gotten into a habit of just closing the app before I do anything."
"It's a mess. For both phone and computer, it's always seemingly having this ""Connection,"" issue, which causes me to have to close and open the app a second time for it to work properly. It slows down when I look through my gallery and takes forever to send the pictures out, even IF you have good battery. On computer? The app is HORRIBLE with streaming (w/ Nitro too!) and it's slow as hell when you stream even the smallest of games."
"App has potential and I appreciate the efforts of the team and the response to support emails. I'm sure they're struggling. But the app is just plain buggy and a pain to use...or not use. All channels but 1 have disappeared from the list, if I tap on a notification the channel opens as ""no text channels"" and the channel that i opened through notification is read only. The issue is known, but there is unfortunately no eta on when it will be fixed. App is unusable. I wish them luck."
"The interface is extremely buggy. For example the app will force you to change chat & chanel pages when ever I rotate my screen or switch apps for a split second, the keyboard won't show up some times & it forces me to rotate my screen to get it to pull up, as well as the hold for options pop up. The voice chat is just as bad it randomly crashes, its interface disappears then it won't pop back up, the audio cuts out at random, & video freezes without buffering. It does it on any type of service."
"I've had discord for a few years now without any issues, but lately it's been having this weird glitch where all but one of my channels in a group chat will randomly disappear. No one else in the chat has this issue, and I still get their notifications for those channels, but I can't respond and the channel disappears again when I exit out. The only way I've found to ""fix"" this is to uninstall and redownload the app, which I've had to do twice now."
"It works fine for the two servers I've been invited to. Problem is, I see no way to find any other servers; this app lacks the ""explore"" / ""compass"" button I've read so much about. Seems the only solution is to use the Web version, which is way too small on a phone, and out of the question on a laptop (no home intertubes out in the sticks -- only phones). UPDATE: Dropped one star; just discovered app refuses password autofill. Yes, I know the security risks -- that's why we have 2FA, isn't it?"
"Extrodinarily buggy mobile app, much less stable than the desktop version. Video playback is abysmal, slow and finicky. The app sometimes gets stuck in landscape mode, causing visual bugs; channels being offset to the right too far, channel list being cut off prematurely, images being misaligned. More of a chore to use most the time. I suppose that's the average today, as people just accept the abysmal quality of mobile apps without criticism. Do better please, have more pride as a programmer."
"It got worse, was sending images to a friend and it glitched out very badly and it's never done that before. And it showed me the error image on almost every image I sent. Prev: The recent update added a weird thing of swiping to the right to reply and I dislike it, used to use that to see the people in the server. And now sometimes when someone has their camera on it won't load at all and will just show a loading screen."
My account keeps constantly saying connecting and I have to keep deleting it and redownloading it (only works for a few minutes before doing the same thing again). It's never done this and I've had discord for years. The calls also keep saying connecting or knocking out the other person's video randomly and I have to hang up and rejoin for it to work again
5/3/2023 update: Discord on android again suffers with clunky response times & odd page change glitches. Uploads are super slow to select images (before actual upload). On other occasions I've been locked in the content of a conversion while trying to access another (like stuck w/ DM content when trying to access a server channel) I'm really hoping that we get this fixed soon. I'll have to hope linux discord remains stable enough (though I've gotten a few crashes from streams there too).
"Only just started using the app and already so many issues. The server that I'm on, after a while starts glitching and only letting me type on one of the channels in it, and lately it's made it so I can only see one chanel on the server til I uninstall and reinstall. It's happened quite a few times to me and my friends (all different types of phones)"
I'm really trying my best to stay on discord side but this last update just has me so frustrated. I used discord for years now and the thing I liked about it was the swipe navigating. It was easy and I got very used to it... then they got rid of it. I can't even revert back to it nor was it an option to switch back. The new discord UI for mobile is clunky and slow. I go into a server and I have to click the channel i want instead of just seeing them all because the swipe is gone. It's very hard.
"I've been using this app for a while now, and it's frustratingly buggy. It'll be fine for a while, but then it will go back to forever ""connecting"". Doesn't matter if I'm on data or wifi. It will struggle to connect even if I uninstall and reinstall the app. If I ever send a picture it either doesn't send or sends multiple times instead of once. And I think it's just because I'm an android user, my friends who have Apple don't seem to have these problems."
"My biggest gripe right now is inability to send 90% of pictures. They're not too big and its not privacy issues. They just simply won't load for the me nor the recipient, I can receive them. I've spent forever trying to fix it and it won't. Why is the app so terrible? It's only good for texting words only. Not calls nor pictures."
"ever since the latest update my video hardly ever works. i don't ever get any incoming video from people I'm in a call with. I've restarted the app, I've restarted my phone. uninstalled and reinstalled. I've cleared cache and everything. what's going on discord?? that's the biggest issue I'm having in a long line of other issues"
"(Original review, October 2022): In the past month or so, the performance has worsened so severely that Discord has gone from being my favorite app, to the most frustrating app on my phone. It crashes every 30-60 seconds, and every time I update it just gets worse and worse... (Update, April 2023): 6 months, still broken. App is still virtually unusable, most of the time it crashes before I can send a single message. 100% of the time it crashes within 5 minutes. Can we please get a stable build?"
"I use discord a lot. But this new update makes it incredibly hard to tolerate it. There are countless bugs, such as the favorite emotes not showing up fully, with the rows extending beyond my screen. Edit: Most previous issues have been fixed and removed from the review. But the emote menu isn't fixed, and the newest update changes swiping left to reply to a message instead of bringing up online members. Please add an option to turn these unwanted features off or revert to prior versions."
"I like the app, I've used it for 5 years now but recently I've been having issues with voice chats, I can't set an audio output and it causes me to receive no sound or produce any sound. Very annoying. I've tried every possible troubleshoot provided by discord, google, and reddit yet nothing fixes it. It is not my phone or my headphones because it works on other devices and apps perfectly fine except for discord, whatever is wrong with discord mobile needs to be fixed 🤦‍♂️"
"I've used Discord reliably for a long time but this past month I have had numerous issues. Crashing in the middle of calls, my menus being a single emoji wide, both my messages and the messages of others not showing up until I completely restart the app. (And yes I tried reinstalling and resrarting)This is quite upsetting as Discord's become my number one method to contact my friends and family. I hope you guys get this sorted out. I'm a nitro user, that's how much I use and value this platform."
"The app was good until the issues with uploading images came. It will either take you less than a minute or 10 minutes to upload a single image. The thing im more concerned about though is voice chat. I can no longer hear anything but the soundboard in calls and ive tried everything to fix it, Please if possible resolve this issue, but until then i cannot give discord anything higher than a 2"
"I use discord all the time! Any app that pops up a full-screen ""GIVE US A RATING"" bubble gets an automatic low score, however. Want a rating? Here's your rating. There's also the fact that when app behavior is changed, there's often no way to revert to the prior functionality, such as the recent-ish change where swipe left replied to a message. This would have been fine if it was an option... but it forced the behavior with no way to use the old behavior of opening the right side panel."
"Discord mobile seems to have been a complete mess for well over a year now, with updates that break things constantly or just don't do anything. Recently the option to tap and hold a message to show options is broken, I can't even describe the mess it is. But as to videos freezing, connection issues, servers seemingly disappearing or just not being able to open a server, it's a plain mess. I like discord and use it both on pc and mobile but it's very frustrating having learn to bypass issues"
"New update causes a bug to happen where certain emojis from other server just won't work (as a nitro haver). As well, a few updates ago, it was made where links in our ""about me/bio"" section are no longer clickable. I don't know if this was on purpose or if it's an unfixed bug, but either way put it back. There's no reason for the link to be blue/show as an active link if it doesn't even work."
"App performs very poorly, doesn't remember where I was when I closed it, shows the wrong people in DMs before it loads, sometimes shows messages in places they were never sent, and if I turn on voice activity, it refuses to detect my voice, among many other issues. Discord itself is probably a 3.75 on PC, but this app is a very poor showing and needs some serious tuning."
"Video calls constantly freezing. Been happening for a while now. My girlfriend lives far away and this was the main way we stayed connected via video. Now every call and group video chat freezes after 15-20 seconds. Minimizing the chat and maximizing it again refreshes the video and ames it work again. But then it freezes again after 20 seconds. After looking this up, it appears to be an ongoing issue for a lot of people now."
"As much as it pains me to say this, all these recent updates to the Mobile version of this app are a broken, buggy mess with little thought put into them. Everything was fine before that one mishap of an update which risked the security of many. Now it's worse than a security problem to even use anymore. I think it stems down to you all trying to make the app like the PC version. News flash, phones are not computers. Advice: Take out all the garbage added and your app should work smoothly again."
"I absolutely love discord and use it everyday for vcing, chatting, and hanging out with friends. On my pc it works flawlessly, BUT, on my phone it just keeps crashing. I will be able to use it for a few days and then I will get in some channel and discord will crash over and over and over. The only way to fix this problem seems to be either reinstalling or just waiting a day or so. Hopefully this gets fixed soon, because this problem only started happening after discord updated around 4 week ago"
"Currently the app is in a very poor state. I cannot reliably use it for messaging. The app must be restarted frequently to reconnect to the servers otherwise it hangs on the ""connecting"" message. It does not matter what wifi/cellular (excellent speeds on each) I use. I'm on a newer galaxy Phone so I don't think it is my device."
"I love this app, but with one of the new updates, it added the hang-up noise when someone leaves the call. This is incredibly frustrating because I like to fall asleep on the phone, and I keep getting woken up by a LOUD hang-up noise, no matter how low I put my volume. Please fix this or make an option to disable this feature. It's becoming unusable for me. Edit: Happens on data & wifi"
"I love this app because it's generally entertaining and all but I don't know why there's been so many glitches like the screen freezing when I click on a profile or holding down a message to edit it or delete it, what I always do at this point is clear storage and it starts working again but most of the time it happens immediately again. I don't know what's wrong with it."
"Latest update is absolutely terrible. Added unnecessary buttons to transfer discord vc, cluttering up the interface, the app is loud as all get out when you do anything in a vc, whether it be muting, unmuting, connecting or disconnecting, and has now added an unnecessary beep when using push to talk. You are also unable to adjust the volume of any of these sounds. App also forces the screen to go to lockscreen now after so many seconds. If there was a way to revert, I would"
"A recent update messed it up. Ever since the recent update, the app lags when you are typing something. It lags and takes a minute or two to load any letters you hit. Which sucks cause I don't want to use my computer every night I get on Discord. I'm used to getting on my phone and relaxing. Now the update ruined that. Thanks a lot."
"I originally gave this app 5 stars, but lately, it's been less and less functional. Messages now copy into other chats when I switch between them too quickly, it says ""connecting"" even when I'm on wifi, and sometimes it even disconnects me from my wifi. It also causes my keyboard to freeze up while I type, especially when I switch between the symbol and letter keyboards. It's in desperate need of patching, I am not the only one with this issue that I know."
"Ya broke the app with this new update. For one thing, it feels like bloat. i wouldn't be able to tell you why but with more demand for performance comes a hotter phone and an even worse feel to the app. Second, images sent to groups are being sent with the full resolution, escaping the viewing panel and i am unable to view completely. Third, the image selection for images you want to upload has changed to include this overly sized gap between rows of images and it's either a weird separator or."
"The adds seem to get longer, ie; 27,30 seconds while dueling in Mob control game. Then I'm defeated while playing, because points earned aren't counted. VERY FRUSTRATING!!! I've tried restart, and different Wi-Fi. Nothing has worked thus far. Also reinstalled, but I went back to 0, and I'm ready to get another game, even though I like playing this particular game. Updates would be appreciated."
"Latest update is very buggy. Has a lot of issues regarding zooming in too far on popup windows (when adding emojis or uploading pics) also issues regarding window sizes. Issues with switching server tabs and empty windows, which other users have stated. None of these issues on desktop. Very disappointing to have to keep force stopping the app to repair these issues, especially since I'm a paying user."
"Not sure why but every time I send messages now, the app keeps on crashing. At least on the web browser there's no issues, but I just don't understand why the mobile app itself is having issues. This has been like this since the profile frames were introduced. I cleared the cache and whatnot, and nothing worked. I will change my review if the crashes get fixed. Please and thank you."
"The new update is horrible. There's a bunch of more bugs ((example: when you click on someones message the options are in some weird vertical box)) the swipe to reply function is HORRIBLE and it pisses people off with muscle memory to just swipe to see the member list, nobody asked for it. it should be optional to turn it on and off or simply just get rid of the function all together."
"I've used discord for a couple years since covid, and during that time the app has worked very well for me. However now I find that the app has to be closed a re-opened many times to work, channels will not load, calls cut out at random times. I've only just started having this problem after some of the updates made."
"The app is so buggy. Constantly locking me out of chats. Like the comment box just disappears. I have to delete the app and reinstall the app any time I want to comment, seems to be the only thing that makes the comment box come back. And now I'm just not even able to log in. Tried resetting the password. Nothing's working. Edit: I did manage to log back in. I don't know. But the chat box keeps disappearing and reappearing. I'll try to contact support if it happens again."
"Another update: App doesn't want to load at times, keeps saying ""connecting"" but never updates or shows any new messages when booting it up This happens sometimes using mobile data, sometimes Using WIFI. Not sure what's going on Update 2: Calls keep freezing. During a call sometimes the video freezes, audio plays just fine but whatever im viewing in a call freezes and doesn't move"
"for the love that is all holy PLEASE fix the mobile app. ive been using mobile discord since 2019 and it seems with every update it gets harder and harder to use. i cant stay in vcs for long without it crashing and reconnecting me randomly, not to mention it can hardly handle basic things like watching streams. not to mention it gives me a little ""Connecting..."" icon at the top of the screen everytime i simply OPEN the app."
"I was using the app almost daily, with no issues whatsoever, until recently. Apparently, there was an update, and it made the app literally unusable. Every time I try to change servers, the app crashes. I haven't been able to chat with friends in almost 2 weeks, because of this, and it's extremely aggravating. I know, I know, first world problems...but, this is a major line of communication for me. I'm on the verge of deleting the app altogether!"
I loved this app it worked perfectly fine for years now but all of the recent updates have been creating new issues specifically on mobile. Recently I discovered a bug where when watching my friends stream on my discord the audio is completely muted if you muted their stream on desktop. The only way to fix it is to get back on your computer and unmute their stream on there. Not to mention the most recent update adds a large green bar at the top of streams that's very distracting while watching.
"it's flabbergasting how awful this app is, and every time i update it it gets worse! even just being in call is unusable garbage, it destroys your other audio, and the call audio only comes out the bottom right speaker?? this latest time it's also resetting the volumes i set people to, and the whole thing is laggy despite my extremely good android phone, and the UI has 3 more hoops to jump through to do anything compared to a few months ago!"
"Recently there's been bugs with sending images to people. It either won't send, or you'll have to close and reopen discord for it to show. It's only been happening since the recent update but all the methods suggested for fixing it have failed and it's quite frustrating."
"for the past month I have not been able hear my friend's stream audio. I've done pretty much everything to fix it and so have they, including deleting the app and reinstalling but it's just permanently broken. it causes a lot of problems and we pretty much can't hang out like we used to /: really obnoxious"
"i have been using discord for years (2015 or so at least) each progressive update since fall of last year has made it run worse and slower. i have NEVER experienced this many connection issues and flat out refusals to load. wifi, data network, doesn't make a difference. I've had to reboot my phone twice in as many hours just to get the goddessforsaken app to load my chats. this is ridiculous. what's going on?"
"Once discord started to get popular, the devs seem to have become really lax on the quality. There are so many bugs that require a hard reboot of the app or even fully reinstalling and that only fixes the problem for so long. It doesnt take long for it to come back again."
"Normally calls work great but after I got my new phone for some reason everyone tells me that my voice quality sounds bad. I'm not sure why, it is a newer phone with more memory, all my settings were set the same as previously. According to them I sound garbled now and I went from an LG to a Samsung. I've Googled all kinds of fixes and I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app, I've closed all my apps that were running in the background, I've restarted my phone, cleared cache, nothing works."
"Android mobile issues. 1.(Ongoing) Still cannot use attached keyboard on tablet. The text box is constantly defocused immediately after pushing any key. 2.(New) When opening gif search window, discord freezes and lags as I scroll through them. 3.(New) I sometimes have to tap an emoji or gif multiple times before it sends to the DM/input box I'm entering it in. (Added a star back as you guys are working hard to fix the more major issues. These little ones need attention also. 🙂)"
"The newest update made it worse and added a bug, it was ok before but now when I DM my friend her profile picture randomly disappears, and I can't see it anymore even though it's there. The only way to fix it is by uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, but I don't want to do that everytime."
"Ever since this new update everything is laggy, especially moving roles or channels they're really buggy and you can't even properly move them, I have an excellent phone but when I'm voice chatting it overheats and drains my battery, I uninstalled and reinstalled. Fix this, discord used to be so much smoother but now it's really buggy, the new image system is worse, you can't even see the full images until you press on it."
"For the past year, discord has been releasing updates that nobody wanted, and nobody likes. If they keep updating the app like this I'm just gonna drop it and go back to normal texts and calls. 2 stars until they revert the most recent update which makes it so whenever you upload 2 image/video/gif files, it cuts them so they can fit side by side, making it so you have to manually click each one to view it. It's hard to believe this app was the best at one point."
"Most recent update broke something. The app's ability to act like it's connected to the internet breaks approximately every 5 minutes, but comes back immediately if I stop and reopen it. If I try to send a message after the point it stops loading (which isn't noticeable until I switch to a new channel) I usually lose the reply, and have to type it again when I reopen the app. This bug is aggravating"
"Ive used discord nearly every day since 2017. Pretty great app, but the new font changes are incredibly terrible. Harder to read font, letter spacing is too low, font size is too small, etc. I would prefer an option to use the old font style instead, but there's no option, and all the options for changing the font size are off when the letters themselves are too cramped. Sad! Please change it back or give us the option to."
"1) All of the buttons on the UI are gone. Like the graphics for them. Such as the different tabs, the call buttons, everything. It's just the background color. It looks like it hasn't loaded. It makes it virtually impossible to use, because you'll accidentally click video call at 4:43 am 2) You can no longer send screenshots from other discord chats. It's so annoying, cause my friends don't wanna download a file just to see a pic. 3) Unless I close the app, it messes up my music after a call"
"Voice chat feature has stopped working for me on mobile, despite exhausting all recommended troubleshooting options (including reinstalling). I can join the call, but no one can hear me and I can't hear them. Hardware is all fine. I can only get it to work if I switch to my chrome browser, but I can't be heard if my screen goes to sleep so not a convenient option."
"The new update has ruined sending images. Recently, as of the last few days, there was an update to how images are selected. It has lead to massive latency when posting an image. Once selecting the palette for images there is an immediate drop in performance and closing out of the palette takes close to 20 seconds. It may be the program is trying to load all images at max resolution at once. I can't think of what else would be causing it."
"This used to be an absolutely excellent app for logging and viewing fitness data; the graphs and trendlines for weight and other metrics were excellently designed and I used them every day. -Unfortunately, in July 2022 they updated all the graphs with ""improvements"" that made them completely unreadable garbage on Android, and almost a year later they still aren't fixed. -App still works well for controlling the wristband and entering data, so I gave it two stars for at least doing that."
I was happy with the app and my sense 3 watch until recently. It was not the most recent update that was the problem because I was having problems with syncing my watch to the app and then thought to look for an update and install it hoping it would fix the issues. It did not. I tried all the suggestions on the app for fixing the problem and none of it worked. I don't know what the problem is but it's very disappointing. Also hate that they have taken away the challenges.
It needs to be charged waaaaay too often...I'm thinking of replacing it because after 2 years it needs to be charged a couple of time a day. The free premium trial was also ridiculous....after the trial I couldn't cancel my subscription....the customer service line said it wasn't their problem...eventually I had to cancel my card and get a new one so you'd stop charging me...the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does have some great features...but I'm sure the competition does too.
"Wouldn't recommend spending more than $100 as these watches are designed to fail after a year. The altimeter is completely unreliable and show different results on every run. The find my phone function rarely works. The charging is quick so a three day life is workable. The screen is bright in sunlight. Overall, it's gotten worse since Google took over."
"My Versa 3 was working fine, not perfectly, but fine. Well yesterday it wouldn't sync with the app so I deleted the watch from the app and now I'm not able to pair it again. I keep getting a ""server error"" message. If this isn't fixed soon I'll have to try a different brand, which I don't want to do. Edit: I was able to pair the app with my watch again, but I'm still having problems keeping everything synced. 😳"
"Charge2 was so much better for notifications, and syncing. I have to quit Bluetooth and the app, which won't quit, and then restart Bluetooth to get it to sync after a long wait. Does not remind me to move, does not notify me when I reach my step goal. Seriously considering going back to my charge 2. Gave me everything I needed. A pain. Regret my update to the newer model."
This has been an excellent app so far. The only feature I feel like it is missing is the ability to add or modify symptoms related to menstrual cycle tracking. I have slightly different symptoms which I wish I could add. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. Edit: periods are also REALLY difficult to edit in the app.
"I would have left a higher rating previously as I don't have very many issues with the app itself. The sleep tracking has not been very accurate lately and I occasionally have issues with syncing. My main issue is that the challenges are no longer available. They were the main reason that I use the app, and periodically upgrade my Fitbit itself. BIG MISTAKE GETTING RID OF THE CHALLENGES!! BRING THEM BACK!! Pretty please?!?!!?!"
I love that I'm able to track so much but I loved it more when there was more we could do as teams. The friendly competition was so much more fun ! I was looking to upgrade before this happened but I'm actually looking to getting rid of Fitbit all together now along with My friends who completed challenges with me. It just isn't fun anymore. All motivation is gone. I can pretty much get the same from an off brand smart watch now.
"For years, it was great. I have had two generations of the Charge fitbits. The Charge 5 is what I have now. The device doesn't sync to the app despite restarting and following troubleshooting guides. I don't see an update I missed, and my alarms have been going off during the day, but my time zone has not changed. I can't sync, no sleep tracking, no challenges, and no relax feature that used to be on it (I've posted in the fitbit forums) Idk what to do with the device, sad to see this fail."
"There are a few unresolved glitches. The activity tab hasn't worked in a very long time, the screen just keeps buffering. Though I reported this issue over a year ago, it's still an issue. Plus the recent foods list just keeps getting longer, it list has foods I haven't eaten more than a year ago. It would help if it was in alphabetical order or just list recently eaten items. I've had a Fitbit since 2011 and found the tracker suddenly, but mysteriously ""dies"" just as the warranty expires."
"I bought a Fitbit after my last smartwatch died. So far I'm not liking the app. The organization is not intuitive. It seems overcomplicated with so many pages that I have to click through to get to where I want to go. On the watch, the control panel pop up in the notification tab is frustrating. It blocks the notifications, which is what I want to see on the notification tab. There should be an option to toggle it off."
"Pretty disappointing, especially for the price of Premium. Data is difficult to find, and the tiny graphs with no option to change scale are basically eye candy but can't be used for insights. The app's own insights and advice are horribly basic, and many times irrelevant. For example, taking a third of my screen to tell me that research shows that moving 15-30 min is good when data shows that I do thousands of minutes of cardio a week is worthless."
"The X axis in most of the graphs is uselessly non-specific. I would like to see every data point over a year; not just an average of each month. There is no way to do this. The 3 month view on the graphs is NOT a 3 month view; it's a current yearly QUARTER view. There is no reason for any of the graphs to be bar graphs. Just copy the code for the daily heart rate graphs, add more time views, and use it for everything."
"This used to be a pretty good app for fitness tracking. The graphs for steps and weight to line up to a start date of a month or a year it didn't really help because you can't compare arbitrary ranges and at the start of the month or the start of the week it's useless. As of yesterday, the heart rate data no longer displays. This is becoming a more and more useless app"
"taking away challenges was a huge mistake & leaves the app with few features that are engaging or inspiring. Sharing progress with others was a huge motivator. Other features have decent data but aren't that remarkable. As for the remaining features the interface desperately needs a dark mode. I don't want to be blinded checking calorie count or sleep setting at night. Honestly, it's a travesty Most apps have an dark option."
"Your app is broken. On the header of the dashboard screen it keeps saying ""To sync reliably, let Fitbit link to One"" with an ""Ok"" button that doesn't tell me anything new or tell me where to go to address this. It just takes me back to the dashboard. I'm not sure what that means but my One is linked. When I go to Settings/Bluetooth it says I have to use the app to link. The warning banner seems to accomplish nothing except annoying me since my Fitbit One is already linked and syncs fine."
"Love it!! Or at least I did. They have changed so much lately, and now I can't even connect the app to my phone so I can use Bluetooth. Every time I try, the phone says I need an app to connect. I switched to a Sense this past year. I sure hope I am not going to have to try another smart watch. As it stands, I am now on my 2nd Sense and have to clean the charging and sensor connections every time it needs charging, or it won't charge or read when on my wrist. My first Sense didn't do this."
"Honestly this fitbit app is one of the worst apps out there. I love my fitbit but the app is pitiful especially trying to figure out how to sync the watch to the app. I can't think of a single reason why they can't have a simple button on the home screen labeled sync now. Update: 4/11/2023 When they notify you that the app needs updating it tries to sync, and sits there forever. Next Fitness watch I buy probably won't be a Fitbit."
"2 items I find lacking with this app is a dark/night mode. The apps bright background and chart colors are hard on the eyes even when I dim my phone screen. Second, the food log is not user-friendly as other apps, especially if you don't eat out. I can't create and save a list of frequent recipes by name, enter each ingredient, portion size,and calculate calories per serving."
"Most of the tabs in the app are nice but the food section is sorely lacking ease of use. You can't create recipes easily and the only way that they do offer you to make recipes is single portions only, so if you have a recipe that makes 4 servings, you have to calculate everything out to single portions instead of being able to copy the recipe and then add how many servings it makes. I have to use a different app to make my recipes and then just add the cals count in on fitbit."
"There are some good features about the app oh, like the sleep tracking. But I am not happy that you all took away the challenges and the trophies and badges. Now my coworker and my daughter are not able to do step challenges with each other. We always looked forward to doing daily, weekly and weekend challenges. Very disappointed to not have those now, to the point of even considering going with a different brand smartwatch."
"I had the Versa 2 and loved it. So when I needed a new one, I was excited to get the Versa 4. I do not like it at all. I've tried and tried to set up the incoming call notification on it, but it does not work. Not as easy to log exercise as Versa 2. I like sleep pattern info better on the Versa 2. I'm thinking about going over to an Apple watch instead."
"Versa 2 stopped syncing My Versa 2 stopped syncing as of the end of last month. Please help anyone if you've encountered this challenge. I've Uninstalled, reinstalled. Rebooted...... each to no avail. It's not even allowing me to set up Wi-Fi, each just keeps going around, around. So no notifications without syncing. Please help. Feeling like I'm back in the 20th century lol."
"Manually synching this with my Inspire 2 is super unpredictable; it only occasionally works for me. I've tried to manually synch it only to get the message ""synch is taking a while, sit tight"" for many minutes without it actually synching, when the Fitbit is right next to it at 100% power. App worked a little better and synched like half the time before February, not sure what changed. It got a little better in March so I added a star."
"I liked having the ability to motivate friends and have a group challenge. It was worth all the aggressive push notifications, but now it is just a bunch of useless notifications with lackluster performance. The widget never updates, the step count is often wrong and I just don't feel any reason to keep track of anything in this app anymore"
"Shouldn't have changed anything, this was 1 of my favorite apps, and something to look forward to during my day, but now all of the challenges are gone which for me and my family kept us competitive and more active with our daily activities and workouts. I canceled my monthly subscription and started looking into different devices and apps for us to use. It's really disappointing, but it does still count and record my steps and workouts."
"UPDATED REVIEW: I used to love this app (5/5 stars), but then they went and took away the challenges. WHY?! The whole point is to be motivated to move more and track that movement! Everyone in my challenge groups were really sad about this change. We've been in these groups for years. And since I upgraded from Flex 2 to Charge 5, I've had nothing but problems. My 250+ step hours are now disappearing when the new hour begins. All Fitbit is motivating me to do is switch to a different brand!"
"So incredibly annoyed with this app. My Fitbit Versa has been working fine and syncing. Then randomly today it stopped. I've done all the trouble shooting: cleared cache, force stopped, restarted phone, restarted fitbit, removed device, readded device, uninstalled app, reinstalled app, but NOTHING WORKS!!! What made this even more perplexing is when I removed my device all of sudden the app actually showed the correct stats. I've been on a premium trial but will not be continuing once that ends."
"App is ok. Very disappointed in fitbit as a whole for getting rid of some of my favorite features (the challenges), which help build community and motivate users to push themselves harder. Have to make sure y'all are hearing this because I'm legitimately going to look elsewhere after a decade of using only your fitness trackers, just because of this negative experience. This is an incredibly dismaying idea. I don't want you tracking my period. That leads to a scary place. I want my community."
"Updated Review! If you are looking for an app that allows to sync your steps regardless of the device and participate in challenges, check out Stridekick!! I'm changing my rating from a 5 to a 2! The main reason that I loved my fitbit was the ability to participate in challenges. I kept this device even though I have a galaxy watch."
"Initially I was excited for the waterproof feature and sleep tracking (May 2019) after ~6 mos w/ my Versa 2, I began to have issues w/ the time syncing back as I traveled. This past time change 10/20(3rd since purchase, did not sync) Has since synced for DST, but not time zones. 12/22 big red X, no reset. Then it worked again, recognizing my watch as a new purchase and giving me a ""free trial"" of Premium which STILL doesn't show oxygen levels in sleep like the free version does. 🙄"
"The app is very glitchy and seems to randomly unpaired from my devices, rendering them pointless. Also, I am paying for Premium specifically to get my sleep data and now the app doesn't show the sleep module on the Today page. It just disappeared when I had to reinstall the app. I wish there was another alternative to FitBit. Very disappointing after buying several tracker watches and using this app for years."
"I've never had any huge issues with the app until the most recent update. The weekly challenges and group challenges were very motivating. It was great getting to compete with friends and coworkers weekly in the ""Work Week Challenge"". Then, the most recent update got rid of all of them. Very disappointed."
"I have had several fitbits throughout many years now, hoping the newer model would correct issues that I have had. There are some good features but also features that constantly act up and do not work, such as calls received on watch, voice command has never worked on sending reply text, and also the find my phone doesn't always work (and phone could be close) I will most likely be changing to another watch to collaborate with my Samsung the next time I purchase a smart watch."
"This was a really cool app/platform,and you could connect with tons of ppl with similar interests or completely different ones. It was such a fun experience. Unfortunately, the powers that be have decided to clip it's wings. I am very disappointed in recent changes. Would not recommend this app. Anymore."
"After my last android update. This app isn't recognized so I can no longer pair my Fitbit rendering it useless for tracking. It's also losing time because of this so it's not even good as a watch. Talked to support many times. They suggested buying a new Fitbit. It's not the watch, it's the app and no one can get to the bottom of it."
PLEASE FIX THE BUGS IN YOUR PERIOD PREDICTOR. can't change the time of a real period and not have it just go back. can't change a predicted period. The number of symptoms is DRASTICALLY less than what people experience and there's no way to add new ones... it's like the app feature was developed by a guy who researched women. I changed to fitbit tracker 2 years ago to have everything in one place and am regretting it. I will have to spend 2 hours putting everything back in old tracker.
"The app has stopped keeping log of my workouts. Really disappointing considering that's the whole point. And if you try reaching support, all they have is a bunch of trouble shooting options before finally telling you that it's actually on the developers end and not yours. It's been days and it's still not fixed."
"The app shows good information tracked by Fitbit (steps, heart rate, etc). However, the user experience is not intuitive, and the stats don't update in a reasonable amount of time (especially the sleep data). I've updated the app and the Fitbit device, Bluetooth is always on for syncing. No dark theme either. Overall a disappointment."
"Horrible recently. First few months I had little to no issues. Now the app and my Inspire 2 no longer communicate. If Bluetooth is turned off for any reason, forget syncing once it is turned back on. Aggravating. I've just about given up. Premium subscription. Help is nonexistent. ""Follow these steps"" tutorials have zero impact in garnering a fix. I don't know if it is a firmware issue, or they are making it harder to use, to force the purchase of a newer device (seemingly). I'm fed up."
"I've had my watch and this app for a couple of years, and it usually works fine, if a little slow. But the syncing suddenly stopped working. It keeps saying it needs to pair with the watch to sync, but the watch is already paired. So it spins while it tries to pair, never pairs, and now it won't sync. It's amazing to me how ""fixes"" for things I don't care about always seem to break the things I actually need."
"I have a Fitbit Inspire 2. Active just over a year now and it's been nothing but problems for months. I'm constantly having issues with syncing and can't get it to sync at all now. Software is up-to-date, it's been rebooted multiple times, phone has been restarted, Bluetooth turned off and on, and I can't find anything to go past that so when it all fails, I can get it to work again. It just absolutely will not sync. Can't update firmware because it won't sync w/ the app. Useless at this point."
"I've had the versa 2 for several years with no issues. Now, I can't use it. It will only display the wrong date and time and will not sync. I've tried several thing including a soft reset, uninstalled the App and made may changes in settings with no luck. Used the troubleshooting tips and those didn't work. Very frustrating!!! Will probably purchase a Samsung watch or something else to replace the versa. I have read several comments and see so many other people with the same issue."
"This is my 2nd fitbit versa. My previous one, having the swimming option, was water damaged. However, I did like the functions. So I went and bought the Versa 3. Was working fine for the past year, but now it doesn't connect, works when it wants to, and getting quite frustrated with it already. Whatever updates were done, they're not working"
I got the Luxe fitbit in July and everything was great! It all synced with my phone and was able to get text & email notifications also. Then it suddenly stopped getting notifications. It won't sync anymore even after doing all the troubleshooting. Today it has been running 3 minutes slower than my phone time and I have checked the time zone setting etc. This sucks! Why is this happening???
"Features offered don't work. Sleep mode works for a few months then stops graphing. Same with heart rate. Ditto for others, if they ever worked. Emails and chat were useless. Browsing on Google shows that many people are having the same experience. These seem to have been extant un solved for quite a while. If it was a paid app, it would be totally unacceptable. As a free app, it's marginally acceptable, but rather unsatisfactory. Fitbit tech support is useless."
"I've had a Fitbit for years, but I'm switching to Garmin because of the app. Since I started training for races, I am paying more attention to the stats and realized that my runs are rounded to the minute. It's important to track performance and I need to be able to see it down to the second. While the watch itself shows the run to the second, there is no where to see that data in the app. That's a deal breaker for me."
"I've been a fitbit user for years. Lately it's been awful. The server reliability is lacking. The sync function on the app is intermittent and I'll have to manually sync multiple times to get accurate updated stats. Now my luxe can't sync, my steps and everything disappeared from the top except for my calorie count, which still isn't accurate because my heart rate isn't syncing. And my device battery is faulty. It will be fully charged, after a few min of wearing it the battery level drops."
"The latest update has destroyed my battery life unless I turn off Bluetooth. The watch is constantly syncing and draining much, much faster than it used to. Previously, I charged the watch once per week and now it can't even last 4 days with all phone functions disabled (no texts, calls, etc). They need to bring back the option to disable automatic sync and allow manual sync only. AWFUL update."
"I factory reset my watch the other night to try and get rid of an issue it's having where it keeps telling me that a linked device needs attention. Even though I unlinked that device months ago and haven't used it at all. Unfortunately, that still pops up AND now I can't quick water, food, or weight on my watch. Apps don't want to sync. It's falling apart."
"Generally a solid app. The Stairmaster doesn't capture the effort accurately. I usually just use ""workout"" as an alternative but flagging here for the dev team. Hopefully, it doesn't mean all the other tracking is incorrect. Edit: Not sure what's happening here but the watch isn't tracking HR anymore. Please fix your software or send an update through. Can't advocate for a poor product"
"Not anything to write home about. There are too few mindfulness videos for it to be good for that. The calorie counter doesn't allow you to customize calories, so it's no good for anyone with a medical condition who needs different macros, pregnant women, breastfeeding women, or anyone with thyroid issues. It's a really subpar app, especially if you compare it to other trackers. Fitbit may be the big name, but they do not have the most features, and the features in the app aren't adaptable."
"My fitbit stopped syncing to the app after a Samsung software update on December 30th. The sleep info is my favorite feature of the app, but it's lost now that it can't sync. Reading other reviews it seems like other Z Flip 3 users are experiencing similar issues, but it's unfortunate that an update hasn't been put out yet. I'm on a free trial for premium and feel bad for people who are actively paying for this."
"Loved it till I reached the end of my premium trial. I have 1 month left but decided I wasn't using the extras enough to pay each month. I canceled my subscription in advance, so I didn't forget. Now my fit bit has sync issues, won't track my sleep, is VERY glitchy, and only recognizes my heart rate 1/2 the time. Technically, I am still a premium member for another month. Who knows if it will work at all after that point. MAJOR disappointment after 5 months of loving the app and losing 30 lbs."
"It's wrong. I don't know if it's the fitbit or the app, but it's very wrong. It says I went to sleep at 10:05 last night, but I was up until at least 12:30 AM, not to mention the time it took me to actually fall asleep. So I know it's off by over 2 hours and 25 minutes. UPDATE: the fitbit disconnects from the app frequently, and now I can't get it to reconnect at all. I've tried restarting my phone and the fitbit. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. It will not connect at all."
I've been having issues with Bluetooth connectivity for months now with my charge 5 and none of the troubleshooting has worked. No issues with any other Bluetooth devices so I have to assume it's an issue with the app. It's like the app and device have a missed connection. I've not had this device very long and shouldn't be having this issue. When the app works it works fine...when it works.
"So it's not just me. I have loved Fitbit and I have raved about and how much I like their devices but for the past few months and recently the syncing doesn't work and I have no data saved. Going back to December 9th. The app and devices are five star review material, but unless they fix the app there's almost no use and wearing it anymore as it doesn't track anything nor can I check anything. Please fix it!"
"Issues become almost a monthly occurrence with hours spent on chats and calls with customer service. So I upgraded the tracker, thought it might be better. Then, the new tracker suddenly stopped tracking sleep a few nights ago. Tried what they suggested in the cookie cutter instructions. Didn't work. But now there's no possibility to reach customer service either. I'm going in an endless loop and never getting to chat phone and email option. Update: +1 star. sleep tracking is back."
"Not a good product. I bought this on sale over a year ago. I once waited 6 months to get a replacement after the first purchase died within 30 days. The replacement charges well but that's, about all the good news. The fit bit app and watch make for a really regrettable purchase! The watch is uncomfortable to wear and I seldom sleep wearing it in bed. I find difficult to make changes and to add data to the premium app."
"When is the next update coming for Android users?! Ever since my Flip 3 updated in December, my fitbit won't sync with the app at all. This is getting ridiculous. Why is it taking so long to roll out the update?! I'm really annoyed. I can't use my fitbit to its full capacity because of this syncing issue. This needs to be resolved ASAP. It's been a month now."
"Bluetooth shouldn't require internet. I just use this app for seeing my step count. I use a Fitbit inspire 2 on a clip on my belt, sometimes it is not easily accessible. If the Bluetooth is on, why can't my app connect to my device? It just tells me that I need to connect to the internet. If the fitbit has the information, and the phone is connected to the fitbit via bluetooth, you should not need the internet."
"Not intuitively set up, to compare you must go into each day and measure separately, instead of just being able to toggle from one day to the next. The heartrate dashboard (the whole point) almost never loads, unless you entirely log in/out. And it seems like it got worse *after* I paid for premium. Heart rate should also be overlayed/matched with sleep cycles, or at least the sleep heart rate (under restoration) should have a precise time reading."
"I don't know if it's the app or my FB, but I am constantly losing sync with my Versa 2. I have to force stop the app and reopen to get it to sync back up, and that doesn't always work. I keep my phone on vibrate, and I depend on my FB to let me know when important emails come in. With my FB not synced, it doesn't get the notification, and I miss out on work opportunities. Between my FBs generally only lasting a year or two and syncing issues, I am seriously considering trying Samsung Watch next."
I just got a Fitbit for Christmas. I have done everything to set it up correctly...it will not stay connected to my Bluetooth and is basically a brick. It does stay connected more often if I have the Fitbit device plugged into the charger sometimes...how can I get the device and the phone to stay connected to each other...I tried contacting support but they had no answers for me aside from hold the button on the versa 4 down until the Fitbit logo appears and let go...that does nothing.
"Here is my edited review. My fitbit was working very well. In fact wonderful for a couple of years then the battery started dieing faster and it started to glitch. Not to mention the way I am having to take it off for a week to heal my skin from what is called fit bit burn. The app, I have not worn it for several weeks and I decided to see what it does. My son is experiencing the same with his versa 2. He says time to upgrade. As for the app itself it needs work also."
"I've had a fitbit for a long time and recently the app hasn't been working right, my sleep data has no information attached to it. I get conflicting statistics on my resting heart rate, on home page it says one number but then I click into it and it is something different. Also i have been having a lot of issues syncing."
"App Stopped working about a week ago to sync up exercise data. It seems like several existing fitbit devices may not be recognized by the app after the more recent merger, which seems like an oversight that needs to be fixed in the app. I have an Inspire HR and am not sure which fitbit products will actually sync with the fitbit app at this point after the device stopped syncing and reading these other reviews about other devices that have stopped syncing after syncing was working previously."
"Typical stuff. When you try to get help with an issue and the answer you get is "" the app doesn't work like that anymore, we removed that function"". Would be nice if you could just continue to use an older version of any app. The older version served everything I needed. I don't need the newest additions at the cost of losing tried and true useful functions. Especially when you're just trying to maintain general good health. I'm not training to be an olympian."
"I have had a fitbit for a few years, first the hr and now the flex. Most recent purchase was about 2 years ago and I normally love it but syncing suddenly stopped and the time is never right now. Please fix. I don't want to have to change brands from something but it's no longer functional as a watch or step counter/fitness tracker."
"Never had a problem an on my second Fitbit no fault to the Fitbit ruff job. But just recently had to have the one I have now repaired and now I'm having issues with it not syncing with my phone. I've done everything it says like turn blue tooth on and off,force stop turn phone and Fitbit off uninstalled still not working. Up date has it for a little while then tried to charge it it started to melt the backa nd charger. Sent it on for repairs now it won't sync at all!!"
"It doesn't matter which device, the heart rate sensor goes out after approximately 14-18 months. I have ongoing sync issues with all devices (scale and 5 watches). If you log out, clear the cache, or uninstall the app, good luck trying to get back in. I was so happy to have Fitbit, and now I'm mostly disappointed or frustrated."
"New Version Issues - the last 4 months or so has required me to manually force sync or lose data. Floor count has been bad for the longest time on Sense. But, today, UI doesn't update properly, it seems to have forgotten that I wear it 24/7 so refuses to baseline temp, sleep, readiness. Please fix soon or another solution might be necessary. Perhaps Google is trying to kill Fitbit off."
Up until yesterday the app worked fine. Now the android version refuses to link with my Inspire 2. The iPad has no problem detecting the Fitbit device on Bluetooth and syncing. The android app keeps asking if I want to pair with Bluetooth and then can't get out of swirly mode if I say okay. I've restarted the Fitbit inspire 2 and it works a little bit then goes off in the weeds again. The inspire 2 keeps working like a champ. The android app is just incapable of detecting it.
"Review of app with premium paired with inspire 2 device. Lots of gimmicks so it's difficult to use the basics. You have to manually start and stop the exercise timer on watch, and if you forget there's no way to correct it in the app. Same with sleep duration: when auto detection is incorrect, you can't fix it. But the worst is that high speed internet is required for app to work, barely functions with cell service - because the history and calcs are all done in the cloud. It tracks my location."
"Great app for tracking Fitbit. If you are interested in observing trends from its measurements, the most recent update eliminated that ability. Seeing a change in sleep habits or resting heart rate over the last 7 or 30 days can be important, but now that is unavailable if it is the first of the week or first of the month. The ability to provide feedback to the app developers via the Fitbit Community is not straightforward. It is disappointing when an ""update"" takes away functionality."
Please undo the recent changes! Graphs are much less useful. No longer shows the time when touching on a specific bar for steps and calories. Unable to look at trends because the views start at Sunday or first of the month where before it showed the last 7 or 30 days and you could scroll through time rather than jumping to the previous week or month. There are other negative impacts as well. Cannot think of 1 change that is actually an improvement. Get a new interface designer! This update sucks
"Skips syncing data. Was great for 2 weeks. Then completely skipped my terrible sleep last night, but recorded my 2 hour nap later in the day. I don't consider that reliable data tracking as it throws off the rest of the months data. Both phone and pixel watch app are up to date. Restarted both Watch and phone. Watch remained connected and stated sync successful. Still not showing the nights sleep data."
"The app basically works, but it drains my phone battery even when not open and supposedly not configured to run in background. It will easily drain 30% overnight. The only workaround is to disable bluetooth. Also, the app's generated graphs are hard to read because there aren't enough vert/horiz index marks on the sides and bottom. Grid lines would also help."
"Your app is vastly different in appearance between IOS and android. IOS offers some features in manual exercise tracking that android doesn't, and vice versa. But BOTH are unreliable because on 2 different phones I was encountering glitches and issues. On IOS anytime there was a scroll wheel, it would overlay all the text options on top one another. On Android, I can't change the PRECISE calories burned or even use the slider because it remains grayed out even after selecting the workout. FIX IT"
"Since November 2022, I've had issues with the app syncing with my device. Without any real support or customer service, I don't even know what the problem is. There seems to be some level of other users with the same issue, but that doesn't help if there is no way to fix it. The device is still tracking my activity, but it becomes a lot less user friendly for me when I count on the features in the app for motivation, details, and other tools. I wouldn't buy Fitbit devices if this continues."
"I don't know what happened but now both my app and my husband's app don't show our steps, floors, really anything on the dashboard. You have to go in to each category to see your daily. It just happened this afternoon because I'd checked it when I got out of the gym at 7am. It's obviously not just my phone because my husband is having the same issue. Will change back to 5 stars once its fixed but right now it's pretty useless."
I like the app I like it better it they did not make so much of it premium that you have to pay for the feature. You pay a lot for the unit then a fee to use the features not right. In my eyes. If you choose to pay for premium you can have work outs to follow. I don't not everyone can afford to pay for that on top of the fitbit I buy this to help witha medical problem to make sure I eat correctly to keep it under control.
"Overall disappointing. App often shows incorrect information on calorie counter (e.g. the numbers will say an amount that is under budget, but the counter will be red and say over budget). Refreshing doesn't help. Often fails to load the exercise information, with the screen getting stuck on a buffering symbol until the app is force quit and restarted. Seems to also have issues correctly syncing with the device (Versa 4)."
"This app was pretty good when I first installed it about 5 months ago. It's just been getting worse and worse over the past couple of months. Graphs missing data, erratic tracking of device data (especially maps), slow synch, etc. Also, the Runkeeper connection is ridiculously unreliable, although I have no idea whose fault that is -- but I have been tracking exercise in Runkeeper for years. I certainly won't be continuing with premium after the 6 month trial. Sad, really. It was promising."
"I used the app a lot in the past, to track my steps, my calories or sleep. Now I only use it to track my weight, and the app is actively getting worse for my usage. I can't zoom in on the weight graph anymore, so it's really hard to read values. The 'month' tab only shows the current month (as opposed to the previous 31 days), meaning you get an empty screen every beginning of the month. Same for the 'year' tab, which becomes useless every new year until April. I'm always reluctant to update."
"Alright app, it's extremely slow to sync with the watch and incessively demands that you sync via GPS location, which is absolutely not necessarily. Plus it keeps pushing its new services on the front page all the damn time. Once you push through all that it has some solid tracking functions. But I got to say, don't get a FitBit. It's an expensive device that double taps you with this data harvesting scam of an app."
They just deleted the challenges and adventures. The only thing I use on the app. Don't pay subscription. You can access most things without. It's not worth the money. I was paying and they suddenly removed features I use making this months payment a payment for nothing in return. Absolute con. There's cheaper version watches out there that do exactly the same plus more
"I've been using Fitbit for many years, even being a premium member for a long time. The app keeps having issues. When I start the app, everything stays white and it sends me a failure report. Often when I click ""wait"" it works after a while. It won't sync with my Sense, I tried various things but the entire thing won't even sync my phone messages anymore for the longest time (red phone icon on Sense). The app is up to date with the latest update (feb2023). I use a Xiaomi phone with Android."
"I like the app, but the upgrades have been making it very annoying to use. They took away challenges, which was the only reason I bought premium, the workouts are alright but it would be nice to be able to search what kind of work outs you are looking for rather then having to scan them all to find them.. I hope they bring back challenges and make this app more user friendly."
"It's all great for a while, until your fitbit refuses to connect at all making it all pointless. It's got to the point where my fitbit doesn't work at all (Flex 2) which has wasted my money. I'd really like this issue to be resolved, I've followed all the steps to try fix it myself from the fitbit website. Its been about a year since an update stopped it working :("
"The functionality of the app is ok and good for tracking health and fitness. A step climbing function for the gym is all it lacks. I have found performance very poor. Lots of bugs, takes too long to perform basic functions and needs restarting/reinstalling on a 10 to 14 day time period. Would be even better if you could add the gradient when using the treadmill function. Fitbit understimates the work rate compared to the reading from the machine. Recently, FB have started to add features."
"The food tracking feature is frustrating. Quite often, when I try to log food and list the quantity, after typing the numeric quantity, I CANNOT change the measurement type (e.g. slice, gram, unit, etc). After typing the numeric qty and clicking ""next"", the dropdown list of the measurement types will pop up and disappear in a blink and doesn't allow me to make measurements type selection!!! Why can't Fitbit just set it as a separate field instead of linking it to the numeric entry field???"
"The app works fine, it's just unreasonable to charge a subscription to access all the features when you're already being charged to buy a compatible Fitbit device. It seems greedy and they premium features aren't that advanced and content you get is easily accessible elsewhere. Other apps offer the same features without the need for a subscription. The food database is also poor and many popular brands are missing. Samsung health is a far better app and requires no subscription."
"Since last update my Versa 3 keeps losing its connection to Google Assistant with my Samsung S22 Ultra. I use Google constantly via my Versa 3 to add items to my Google Keep grocery list, to send text messages and to initiate phonecalls, so this is very frustrating. It has worked flawlessly for the last year or so. I've removed the Versa and Versa 3 Controls from Bluetooth and re-paired, have cleared the cache but the connection is lost again until I reactivate Google Assistant in the Fitbit app"
"I do interval workouts, but in the workout summary, the app shows the move interval as rest and the rest interval as move. Support person #1 said that many users are reporting the same issue and he suggested uninstalling and reinstalling the app because it apparently worked for some. For me it didn't. Person #2 said to turn off SmartTrack. I did and it didn't work. Person #3 said that the update is coming up on Tuesday, March 14th. Hope this will be taken care of. After update, issue persists."
"UPDATE 3 - latest update is ruining QOL. Bluetooth and G-Assistant keeps disconnecting. Horrible horrible UPDATE 2- bunch of previous sleep stats disappeared. This is a sad app. UPDATE 1 - on top of the other stuff below, keeps logging me out of Spotify. Update always failing, some features missing, data manipulation does not exist, cannot zoom in on graphs etc. Should be better than this, especially now that Google bought them."
"Why is it always so hard to sync? And why does the syncing always drop out? It should sync over WiFi as well as Bluetooth so when I'm at home or in the office it is always syncing. I thought I'd be able to say ""hey google"" to my watch without actually going into the app. Wouldn't recommend buying the Sense watch. I can't believe you have to purchase watch faces to get a good one. Make some updates and improvements."
"So dissapointed of them removing challenges. The only reason I have a fitbit and not a garmin or any of the other smart watches. Just bought an Ionic, not impressed so far. I have trouble with the GPS in general finding a signal and also the sync, in Strava I can see the whole route but in the fitbit app it's just wrong. One of my bikeride and the map is just constantly loading been 4 hours now."
"Honestly, the tracking isn't that accurate and the data is second rate, also the functionality of the app and the watch is a bit clunky and not very well laid out. My Huawei watch and the accompanying app were superior on all these points, and I would leave fitbit to go back to Huawei in a heartbeat if it connected with Sony."
"I adore the stories and art that many creators make on this app. However, the app itself has declined over time. When I first started reading on Webtoon I could easily binge and reread series I love, but with the implementation of the daily pass system this isn't possible on some of my favorites now. I actively avoided other apps bc the daily pass systems, and now they have followed suit. I don't have time daily to check in, and due to the 14 day limit I can't go back to remember stuff later on."
I love the stories but this app is becoming too expensive. Instead of doing monthly top ups of coins (or single purchase) you should offer a regular unlimited subscription like Manta does. I'd happily pay $10 a month for unlimited comic access. It makes no sense to pay that amount just for a few coins especially since you all seem to be raising the cost of episodes.
"I've enjoyed this app for awhile, but recently I've had a problem with their daily pass setup. I was slightly annoyed at some of the stories that had the daily pass, but I didn't mind as much when it released 3 episodes at a time each week. But now, it has made the last 3 episodes sit behind a paywall. Maybe this is something that the creators can decide on, but it's frustrating when you don't expect it. I get supporting artists, but I'm not in a spot to do so. I'll just avoid the stories, ig."
"I do love the stories, but I've been unable to purchase coins for weeks. I've emailed directly, used their messaging with customer care (only to be asked up upload my screen shot that shows what version I'm using over and over). It's really obnoxious. The other this, like many other users have pointed out, that the need to buy coins in order to read further has gotten out of hand."
"Editing my review because the daily pass is so frustrating, I don't use webtoon as much anymore. I'm so sad about the ones I really liked. I've been on board with Webtoon for a while. It was great that there were many discoveries made! Intro of ads and coins were okay. THE DAILY PASS IS THE WORST. I can't binge the old ones on my own time. I end up not even reading them because the daily pass is inconvenient. It makes enjoying the webtoon less enjoyable. :/"
I love the stories and arts but because the limit availability of internal hard drive on my phone I can not install the app as it is not compatible with external sd cards. This means stories I was reading before I can no longer read. And find this frustrating and upsetting. Because using the website tells me to get the app but I can't download the app for said above reason.
"The Webtoon app was my go-to place to read comics; however, recently, there's been a bug that freezes the screen and goes back to the home page every time I try reading an episode. It's made it incredibly hard to read through a comic seamlessly, and this was a problem that only occurred after this app was updated. I still love the app (despite this major issue), but I would highly appreciate it if this issue could be looked into!"
The stories on webtoon are great. But the app is frustrating. It constantly overheats my phone and I have to force the app to close because it stops working. So it's rather hard to use. I've tried to install it on other devices like tablets and it would still overheat. Which never happens with any other apps. The only decent way to read webtoons is through a browser. So the app is basically a waste of my time.
"I absolutely love webtoons. I have read so many cool artists and stories. But I'm experiencing quite a bit of crashes, glitches, and overall, very frustrating thing. I opened it up just a few minutes ago to read my updates, and none of my subscription were there. I've tried logging out and logging back in, however there has been no change. While reading Siren's Lament, I experienced one after another of add pop ups that continuously redirected me to the app store before I closed out the app. I've also had the app continuously crash under random circumstances while mid-chapter. Please fix this, I will continue reading, however it is getting increasingly irritating. Thank you."
"I love the app! There is a great wide variety of relatively family friendly, or pg13 comics, but I have had this ongoing issue ever since I got the app. The app crashes, or it freezes my phone. It makes my other apps slow when it runs in the background, too. I've tried to balance whether or not having this app break my phone is worth it, and it isnt. When it freezes, I cant turn it off, and when it turns off, sometimes it wont turn back on for a while. Fix this, if possible. Thank you 💞"
"Crashes at random. The main thing I dislike about it is that they've added ""daily passes"" for completed series. So you can only read one chapter per day unless you buy coins. I wouldn't mind if it were only with on going series. If a series has already been completed I should be able to read the whole thing if I want to. Otherwise this app houses some of the best webcomics I've ever read. But I give that credit to the artists, not the app creators."
"Love this app and all the manga in it. Just wish there was a not interested button or the ability to filter specific genres out of my suggested lists. It gets kind of annoying and imo gets in the way of finding other stuff i might want to actually read. Update: now they've added a 'feature' where if a series is completed, you have to pay after all the episodes are out. Not very happy about it as i was in the middle of a long webtoon and now i have to pay to finish it. Seems pretty greedy. 🙄"
"I love the variety of content they offer filled with amazing artist and their exhilarating stories that I can't out down! Unfortunately, the application itself constantly freezes and crashes on its own. Not to mention, and I have tested this theory, when having this app downloaded onto my phone, somehow it makes the phone itself restart on its randomly on its own without warning or explanation. This breaks my heart as I love what the app offers but its so buggy that it makes it almost unusable!"
"Newcomers beware. I've had this app for years and I was able to read and finish a lot of really good stories without spending any money. However, in recent years they've implemented a coin system where you can buy ""unlockable"" episodes that normally take several weeks to become free, even the stories that are completed. Thankfully I know how a lot of the good stories already end, but it sucks for the new people that feel like they need to spend money to read content that was once free."
"This app is good for reading comics, especially ones that are multimedia. It crashes a lot, though, and sometimes parts of the comic I'm reading take a while to load. This can happen on any comic, and can get super frustrating. I am not sure why this app is so unreliable. I don't have the same problems with other apps."
"I love love love the comics on this site, but the app is horrendous. While reading comics, the app crashes once every two or three episodes and I have to restart the app and sometime even that doesn't fix it so I have to reboot my phone. Not sure what the issue is, but it gets frustrating when I'm in the middle of an episode and the app freezes mid scroll and crashes."
"Let me start of by saying that this app has some amazing comics in it. My problem with it, however, is it has become increasingly more pay-to-use. It used to be completely free, then they added a coins feature for people who don't want to wait a week, which is perfectly fine. But then they made a paywall for finished series. Why can't I read a finished series without having to purchase a stupid amount of coins the daily pass. Would definitely be 5 stars if it hadn't become so greedy."
"While I love webtoons, I think it is a poor choice to make people who've read a comic from start to finish already to have to use a fast pass once completed to reread the story. I've already finished many comics, and to have to wait to reread some of them again from start to finish, or to find a specific episode and waste a days fast pass on it if it's wrong, is kinda stupid. If you're a new reader I can understand. But for people who read it from start to finish shouldn't be told to wait imo."
"I really want to give this app a higher rating. There are some amazing artists and creators on here, but the app itself sucks. It's glitchy and freezes a lot while trying to read the comic. The bookmarks don't work properly and the app crashes very frequently so you're stuck trying to find where you were last. Love the content but it's so frustrating to have to load the app 3+ times just to read one chapter."
"Nice selection of free comics, as long as they're in progress. Expect to pay big bucks for completed works. Docking stars for their ads, which use trackers and personalization, and for the fact that after all these years, the items you've read still doesn't sync across devices. Good luck figuring out where you left off if you read on a desktop or move to another device!"
"While I love the app for helping me discover new series, ever since coins were introduced it's been annoying. I can't even reread my favorite completed webtoon without having to purchase coins. I think it's great to have them if you want to read ahead in a new series, but one that's already finished and a few years old? Not cool."
"Dont get me wrong. I discovered this app a long time ago, and it was awesome. Like going to a library, but with all picture books or comics. I enjoyed it alot, but when theu switched over to the ""fast pass"" feature. Ive lost all but a little hope in it. I understand that the artists need timw to create such amazing work, but to block access to it for a price feels like an EA move. I leave the app unsatisfied everytime. If this featire is fixed in the future, I will consider changing my rating."
"I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and even though I love reading it for hours on end, I keep getting a weird error where I'll read a chapter then in the background I hear music and a man speaking in another language, it sounds like an ad but I can't see anything to close it. The only way it ends is if I close the app and reopen it which is annoying because sometimes it doesnt save your bookmarks."
"the app was great but I don't like the fact that you have to wait for the daily pass on a completed series it's a waste of time. I'm also experiencing some glitches where the app freezes and closes out. Then once I go back in my progress for that chapter is gone. Finally, what's the point in making an account when it doesn't save your progress when on a different device? I logged to the app after deleting it for months and the only thing it saved was what I subscribed to. Please fix these issues"
"The app was doing fine but now it's crashing and freezing. You can't even read through a chapter with out it crashing, freezing and kicking you out of the chapter to the main menu every 5 seconds. I restarted the phone and uninstalled and reinstalled and same issues. Can anyone fix this? No one can enjoy the stories with this going on. Would be 5 stars if it weren't for the glitches. Better go back to the mangas on crunchy roll."
"App seems to get buggier with each round of edits. Used to get all the updates, when they updated, on the home page. Now I'm lucky if I get one or even a notification. Just learned I missed 6 updates bc the app never told me. It also has affected the writing of a great deal of stories based on the reliance of Fast Pass. Instead of a great all inclusive comic platform its fallen into the trap of commercialism. At least no ads, but at least with ads it levels the field and doesn't create elitism."
"Desperately needs an update. Crashes everytime I use it. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this app. What I don't love is that it crashes EVERY. TIME! It also randomly pulls me out of chapters I am in the middle of reading. Being able to read great stories and see more varied artwork combined has been spectacular - but if it wasn't for the great storytellers using this as a platform to get their work out, I would not use the webtoons app."
"I love WEBTOON and all of the stories on the app! So you can imagine my disappointment whenever I opened up the app every day this week only to constantly be redirected to a page that says I'm not connected to wifi. I thought that reinstalling the app would help, but also a failure. I'm gonna miss my stories, hoping this is sorted out soon since it appears to be happening for many other users as well."
"I do enjoy the app and the content, but it just doesn't work. Every time I go to read something on here, I have maybe a minute or two before it freezes up and brings me back to the homepage, sometimes it even closes out of the app entirely, and then it starts working slower. Sometimes I think maybe if it needs to be updated that will fix it, but it never does. I don't know if other people have the same experience, but my rating would likely be higher if the app actually worked properly for me."
"Recently, going into some comics and reading through had suddenly mid-comic shut down my phone. It starts to turn off to the point where I have to turn it back on and reset the app. I have tested it and it happened 7 times in 10 minutes... I really love the comics and all but, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE??! Helpp?!"
"I love the app, there so many stories to read and they are absolutely amazing. The only thing I absolutely hate is that you either have to pay, wait many days, or use coins to keep reading on at a certain point, even if the series is completed! When you finally get to that climax of the story it cuts you off and you have to wait or use coins..."
"Great app, I love all of the different webtoons and their unique styles, but I REALLY do not like the fast pass system. Once you buy one fastpass episode with coins, you either wait double the time for the next episode to be available for free or you spend more money. The more coins you spend, the deeper you dig the hole, which makes fastpass a huge scam. Instead it should be that you spend a dollars worth of coins to be permanently one week ahead of the free episodes—but right now it's a scam."
"The screen keeps going black and then sending me to the For You page when I'm in the middle of reading a chapter! Then I have to go back and scroll through the chapter until I get back to where I was. It's happened twice in the past 10 min. It's really sad because I love this app and the stories on it but I'm getting really annoyed of scrolling back to where I was, and this has been happening for a while. The top critical comment says the same thing! I love everything else though. Please fix it!"
"I love being able to read new stories and discover new artists. I've been using this app for years. But they have recently added this ""daily pass"" where if you go to read a completed series you are only allowed to read one episode a day. If you want to read more then 1 a day you need to pay. These have ready been completed. It keeps you from being able to binge read anything even if you have watched from the beginning. It gets rid of the ability to re-read anything especially if it's longer."
"I love the app, love the comics. But for the last 6 weeks or so, the app keeps crashing. I can't get through even a couple panels before it staggers while scrolling, cancels out back to the main screen of the app, or completely closes. Have tried clearing cache, clearing storage, and even uninstalling/reinstalling. Completely unstable. When it did work, only gripe I had was that if I installed on different devices or after reset, that all the ones I've read stayed marked as read."
"Overall it's been fine, but the daily pass system has gutted so much of what was good about webtoons. I'm a binge reader, and especially for series with shorter episodes it's really hard to get into the story with daily episode limits, and the cost to unlock an entire series at once is far more than it should be; not to mention the fact that the episodes you unlock expire! I'd be willing to pay a few bucks to reread old favorites, but not this."
"The app has many talented creators with beautiful stories, but the 24 hr pass thing makes me want to just forget about it. I find it pointless. Another issue is that when I download the app on my new phone, all the progress on the comics I've read is gone, but the comics are in my subscribe. That's RIDICULOUS AND COMPLETELY USELESS!!! Whats the point of having the books saved if all the progress is gone. I'm not deleting the app and no longer find intrest in stressing over where I left off..."
"Love this app and the comics. Don't like how it crashes my phone if I stay on the app too long/read too many pages. Does anyone else have this problem? Considering uninstalling. Very dissapointed. Wondering if its a memory issue or something else? My phone just crashed and came back to life after 5mins, I had to turn it off and back on. Also overheating my phone."
"I really used to love Webtoons. But than they started putting ads on the chapters. I've tried doing everything I can and even watched videos, and even tried it on different a couple different phones - the ads wont load or work. I ended up having to just give up and and read the ones without ads, which is unfortunate because the stories were good. Not a good experience anymore. :("
"The content is great, however, with the recent update, it has become very unstable, draining enormous amounts of my phone's battery and frequently crashing. I regularly get bugs in the app that take me out of the webtoon without the whole app crashing as well. I personally don't screenshot webtoons, but the removal of the feature isn't sensible... If someone were trying to steal a webtoon, why would they be on a phone? On desktop, you can simply right click each image and save them.... Nobody truly being malicious will be doing it on mobile... It is a stupid move, and hurts the overall user experience... Needless to say, I am severely disappointed in the latest update and would appreciate it being rolled back. Updates should be thoroughly tested for instability prior to pushing them anyways..."
I really love this app but the event was just ridiculous. It's not fair how it kept resetting completely over and you have to restart all of your progress. I also do not like how sometimes when I'm in the middle of a chapter that the screen will go completely black and send me back to the index and I have to find where I was kicked out of the chapter rather than it bookmarking it like it should.
"I loved webtoon at first. Amazing content, easy to support creators, overall a really good app. Then they put in the Daily Pass and I started to look for other websites. While I admire what the daily pass is meant to do, it's a dumb idea. You only can read one chapter a day, keep it for 14 days, and then you have to start over if you want to read a completed series. It's like going to a library, purchasing one chapter of a book but you dont get to keep it. It makes it impossible to enjoy webtoon"
"They have a great, seemingly endless selection to choose from. The introduction of coins & fast passes wasn't really an issue for me, in fact I actually approve of it but the events to earn coins, although great in concept, are buggy & sometimes don't give you your coins. Furthermore coin packages NEVER go on sale. The biggest issue is how they lock episodes for completed series and make you wait, watch ads, or pay to read & they don't keep track of which episodes you already paid to Fast Pass"
"I love using the app and seeing peoples creative art and stories, but what i hate the most is while I am reading the app will suddenly close for no reason. This has been going on for a while and is completely disruptive when I am completly ingrosed in reading. Please fix this random crashing, I'd love to be able to read without such interuptions."
"I've been on webtoon for the past 6 years now. Originally I would have gone for 5 star. The introduction of fast pass and coins was annoying, but bearable but the new daily pass is awful. The use of it on a completed series and only one episode per day? Silly. Now on new series?? Absolutely ridiculous. I love Webtoon, but honestly this might be the the final straw. With the daily pass making things very slow and way less accessible... They're just asking to be bootlegged and plagiarized."
"I have had this app for many years. As I have had more time I have started reading more and wanting to return to comics I have previously loved. With the new daily pass system that only allows me to read one chapter a day a lot of my favourite comics would take me nearly a year to read. I have been having an issue where when I try to click on the story it will not let me move on to the next chapter, this causes my daily pass to be used on the same chapter twice."
"App keeps backing out of episodes. I have a strong data (wifi and cellular data) connection, but I'll get 2 or 3 pics into the strip and my screen will start shaking and then it backs out to the episodes list. It takes anywhere from 3-6 attempts to be able to get all the way through each episode because I have to keep going back into it. It became an issue 2 updates ago. Get this fixed and my rating will change. Thanks."
"It's has some really good content on there, but the app doesn't seem to actually want to let you read the stories, which is annoying. I intentionally was only selecting finished series and it will randomly cut you off and make you wait literal weeks to let you read a chapter or two more, then stop you again. 🙄 I'll probably use this app for a nother few weeks then give up if this keeps happening. Really frustrating. This ""Fast pass"" thing is NOT it🤮🤢"
"I love this app and it really does deserve more stars, but whenever I'm reading a story the app will freeze and kick me off. Then I have to go back to my subscriptions and find it again. The longer I'm on the app the more often it crashes. I'm starting to get frustrated because I haven't been able to read anything without it crashing multiple times for the last few months. Again I love this app and do not wish to give a bad review. I'm just asking that you fix this problem soon."
"Love the stories but the changes make this app much more frustrating to deal with. Suddenly charging money for stories that were finished a long time ago is a good way to get people not to want to use your app. Not only is it no longer free, now we have Ads after every chapter?? I've used this app for years and I would totally love to support the artists and all but in a better format than this."
"I would love to give a much higher review as I love the stories but this app is irritating. The stories are amazing, very well written, and the illustrations are gorgeous. What I hate about this app is the fact that you have to pay for a lot of the chapters with coins that require purchase or wait a week for the next chapter to be unlocked. To me this is infuriating because by the time the next chapter is unlocked I have already forgotten the last chapter make a way to get free coins or something"
I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that the chapter I'm on randomly closes off and sometimes even completely freezes. This is a common problem and is especially annoying when you get to a climactic scene. It's like watching a big fight in anime and the anime decides it wants to stop loading and restart to the beginning.
I have had this app for a while now and have seen it go through some changes like adding the use of fast pass and then adding daily free pass for completed comics (which I don't really like). The one thing that I think should have been added a while ago is syncing across devices. The main reason this is a concern for me now is I just got a new phone and I have all my subscriptions but nothing to tell me where I left off. PLEASE ADD THIS FEATURE!!!
"I have been using webtoons for years now. I have seen comics come and go and I love reading the updates or going to completed series'. My problem is that they are now restricting it's users with coins and daily reads. This is a new feature that I liked for the fast pass but it's terrible for comics that are done. Look, if ANYONE at webtoons sees this, please fix this. I just don't see myself ever wanting to buy comics I could read before for free but now I have to pay for it. Just please fix it."
"Used to be great but then became less functional and then the introduction of the daily pass ruined it for me, personally. Always had issues with login and downloads and notifications before anyway. Got locked out of some nice series due to the pass, even when I used to get the coins to read ahead and all that. Overall just not worth it anymore in my opinion."
"it's still buggy. getting worse, even. the more I use it, the more it crashes and lags. I would rather have that fixed than a new design. and now the coin purchase isn't working either, and sometimes tapping the heart to like does nothing. there was nothing wrong with the layout, please fix the bugs. I want to be able to read the comics. even now, I would like to be able to buy more coins and I literally can't"
"The app is fine for what it does and there's a lot of interesting stories and comics to read. However, 90% of my experience was getting very into a comic only to get time gated by the daily pass thing. Sometimes I would have hundreds of chapters left to read and unlocking one a day, meaning to catch up to the present it would take me months. You can earn their currency free but it's dripfed and still extremely slow. I uninstalled and will just stick to other sources."
"if I click ""DO NOT SHOW THIS AGAIN"" Then DONT. SHOW. IT. AGAIN! Im very annoyed with the random advertising of other comics just popping whenever the hell they want and not staying gone DESPITE there being an option. Fix it, Im being nice when I say there are certain things I DESPISE seeing on this platform and feel should be filtered by preference and genre type."
"I really like this app but I'm really annoyed at their new update where they charge you for the longer series. Come on, we're already paying for fast pass which is a good way to help support the authors. Charging for completed series is extremely annoying, even if over time it's free. I read through these while they were ongoing and now I can't access them in full without paying? I won't be buying coins at all anymore unless this changes back."
"I love webtoon! I've had this app since 2014, and its always been one of my favorite apps. I despise the new update with the daily passes though, please get rid of it. I am completely fine with the fast passes and I've even bought some coins to read some chapters early but i think its just ridiculous to have to purchases daily passes if I want to read more than one chapter of a completed series.This will only lead to people pirating series off other apps and sites. Please fix this."
"Great comics, great app except for the new daily pass on old completed series. Coins for unlocking new episodes are fine, but introducing this daily pass system on a finished series that was previously free to read, especially during a period when a lot of people have the extra time to binge a series but are struggling with money due to the pandemic, is so user-unfriendly. Even ads would be better. Way to sell out, Webtoons."
"I've used webtoon for a while and have always enjoyed using it, there are some amazing artists on here. But I think the daily pass is extremely inconvenient and makes me want to read comics less and less. If I want to read a 200 chapter comic then it'll take me over half a year to finish the comic, It's just a ploy to get readers to spend more money which is incredibly disappointing from the creators of the app :/"
"I love the variety of comics available to read! A lot of the ones I've found are beautifully drawn. My only issue is it keeps kicking me out of the comic I'm reading, making me have to find my place again. Some chapters/episodes will be totally fine and then some will only kick me out once, and some will even do it multiple times in a row."
Everything about this app is great. The only thing holding it back is the absolutely trash daily pass system. I'm not going to spend the next 2 years of my life to read a web comic. And I'm definitely not going to spend a hundred dollars to binge it (best deal is 1000 coins for 100$. And at 3 coins an episode with most daily pass series having over 300 episodes) Other than the daily pass system I'd say 5 stars.
"It was great at first until they released the daily pass feature. It's really upsetting because I just want to read a comic that's completed without having to deal with a wait. I have uninstalled this app in the past or just completely abandoned reading completed comics because of the lame daily pass. Daily pass: only allows you to read one episode of a completed comic once a day. If you want to read more, you have to pay for coins to unlock the episode, even though the comic was once free."
"I love webtoon and up until this past week or so, it has been a delight to use this platform, if not a wee bit of a drain on my wallet (I blame all the fantastic creators who put out good comics lol). HOWEVER, recently I cannot seem to open any comics for more than a few moments at a time and I also cannot access the coinshop at all. It only ever says ""coming soon"", I don't know if anyone recieved any notification that the store was removed for any reason. Please do fix this if it's a bug."
"I get notified when a new series that I follow releases, but I'm unable to read it. I turn off my ad-blockers and everything, but the ad that I have to watch to read the comic doesn't play, and the only thing I'm told is to ""try again later."" This goes on for DAYS. I'm literally a week behind my favorite comic because this app is so broken and the series creator waits to post them on Instagram."
"Webtoon is an app with a huge selection of material. This works as a double-edged sword, because you end up sifting through about 10 stories to find a good one. Some of the romance comics glorify abusive situations and many categories, like horror and sci fi, have few substantial entries. In addition, the platform is mainly used by middle schoolers, making all comments cringeworthy. The good comics are, however, very good. If you're over the age of 14, you may have a hard time using the app."
"Used to be great. Now there a bunch of pay walls behind all the good stories. Even unfinished ones. I get that it's to support the creators, but not everyone has the financial ability to pay for tokens to read everything. And the ""daily pass"" doesn't do much. Not only that, but the free token events only give like three tokens, and they're all temporary. So you'll just lose them after a while. So your only real option is dumping all your money to read anything you enjoy."
"Not very impressed with the last few updates. The new ""recent reads"" is awful and the most recent list you want to read disappears meaning if you go back it's gone until the next time you click on it or have to search through the subscribed list. On top of this, there's been awful glitches with the reading challenges and I have had the May challenge and the last action challenge not register my episodes I've read. Emailed the service center and they fed me the same BS and didn't fix the issue."
"Ive been a user of webtoon for years, I started reading it back when you could read as much webtoons as you want when it wasnt so restricted. Honestly I miss that. I honestly hate the daily pass system. There are comics I would LOVE to reread but I cant due to the daily pass, I always forget what happens so I have reread a lot. It's super frustrating I don't like the adds underneath the comic. I keep accidentally clicking the add when im trying to go to the next episode, super frustrating"
"The stories have been great, the ui is clean. But. The daily pass system is a glaring problem that will actively prevent you from reading your favorite comics. It is so infuriating that I dropped 3 stars specifically for that reason. The coin system to unlock episodes early doesn't bug me, however the daily pass is a scummy way of monetizing comics that is similar to pay to win games, in that it makes reading so painful that you are forced to pay. It just recently became a thing and I hate it."
This app is one of my favorite go to apps for anytime I'm bored or waiting in line or just at lunch while working. Now that I can't watch the comics I enjoy like I used to...even completed ones years ago...I'm not sure if I will continue using it as often. I'm all for support but not everyone has the money to spend on it and the fast pass was a good idea. The Wall that exists now just makes it entirely horrid. I want my comics back so I can support and enjoy authors works.
"On the site, it said to download the app for more content on a few comics I was reading. I downloaded the app. To make an account, you have to agree to them tracking what you do on other sites to show you content. Yuck. I did not make an account. I went to a comic I was reading and they wanted coins to read ahead, and those require an account. It is fine to need to make money, but you can do it without invading my privacy or using misleading ads. 2☆ because comics rock. Uninstalling."
"Webtoon recently brought a bunch of new webtoons onto their originals which was great! It meant there were things to read while waiting for other comics to update or while they were on hiatus. However it seems like they're not interested in continuing or supporting these series (just look how the greenlit series went) which means they'll loose a lot of the variety in content that keeps me on the app. Support your creators, Webtoon! >:("
"I succumbed to my desires and bought coins, but when I did an error occured AFTER I paid for it (via phone number). When I refreshed the app to check if the coins were there, it wasn't. Then I looked at my balance and saw that it DID charge me. (I bought the ten coins one because I really am a broke student.) I'm not sure if I'll be able to get it back since the email I used on that account is one I no longer have access to. Please help, I just wanna read Night Of Shadows. :("
"This app used to be the coolest thing around I've used it for years I loved how easy it was to use and to see a community come together just to share comics which is why it really hurt to see this app fall down the ""pay to use"" rabbit hole. First it was small things that I didn't really care about like fast past I didn't mind waiting am extra week for a comic I liked. But now with an app that restricts what you can read by how much you are willing to pay it's just not worth it anymore."
"Quite expensive this one. But okay, I have some stories I love to read there. But now it is not quite possible. The coins purchase doesn't work. It happened to me few times last year and somehow it was always fixed (lasted max 2 days). But now it is already a month and every time I try to proceed with purchase the failure message pops up."
"Reducing the purchasing power of coins, so coins you've bought previously are worth less, is a scummy move. The main layout is annoying to navigate. The app is good for reading webtoon content."
"It's easy to use, and it has a great number of comics you can read. The problem is payment and email. You cannot change your email, you cannot pay without needing to verify in a way that your bank does not offer, and therefore you cannot fast pass. I seem to always have some problem with this app every. single. time. I'm using it."
"It's got really good comics. I didn't mind spending some money every now and then for fast pass coins but they suddenly start raising the prices per episode, so no more spending on my part. Pity they turn greedy"
"I have been using Webtoon for a very long time and i love it. But with daily pass, i lose track of what webtoon i have to read everyday in the recent section. I don't really mind that Webtoon has added this feature. But with it, i suggest to have a daily pass section to make it easier for the reader to find webtoons with daily pass, instead of putting everything in the recent section."
"I love the stories, none of those are the issue. But the sheer amount of daily pass stories is insane. I'll be waiting for a story to be finished and I go back and now it's locked behind daily pass. I'd rather watch an ad before every episode."
"Good stories but constantly asking for day passes. I'd prefer a membership option, like Manta and other comic reads, where they still have daily passes, but you have an option to pay and not have to worry about them."
"Most of the episodes are 70 cents equivalent now, which seems steep considering there doesn't seem to be much regulation on length. I'm also not a fan of the daily passes. It just seems to me you should really hope that doesn't get put on every series as it's a great bait and 'oh, are you sure that's enough'. I would pay a rate for a pass that unlocked as many eps as you want of a series for one day, otherwise no. And I'm not spending 70 cents to unlock episodes. I guess I'm going to another app"
"I have been using this app for years. It had been decent, and then they added the daily pass. I thought, ""Okay, I can wait to unlock everyday"". However, now you CANNOT finish the webcomic without spending coins. Please consider adding an advert instead, so those of us with little money can finish enjoying the artists work instead of having to find out sources on the internet. Other than this, I have loved using this app and reading webcomics daily."
"I used to LOVE this app. Coins don't go as far as they used to and it's so difficult to go back through episodes because of daily pass. It's becoming too similar to all the stupid story apps where you have to spend thousands of dollars just to finish a story. No thanks, I'm too poor to spend that much on entertainment"
"I love this add but I absolutely hate how content is paywalled behind things when the story is older or is completed. Why am I being punished for either wanting to go back and reread a good story or wait until a story is finished but get too busy with life to be able to read it. As a result, I'm being punished for not reading it as the story is active."
"I used to love this app and buying coins for fast pass access was so easy and convenient. But now, I'm not sure what has changed but anytime I try to buy coins, it says, ""Item unavailable in your country."" So, I can no longer use fast pass, even after I looked for updates for the app."
Love the content and stories it's just their stupid daily pass that makes reading completed comics hell. You can't even re-read comics that you've finished because you have to wait for ONE daily pass per day I mean it's stupid especially if you're reading a long comic that has 300 chapters that's like waiting a year to finish a story it's ridiculous and needs to be changed now!!! It was never like that before which especially sucks for old readers who had the luxury of not having to wait so long
"Going down to two stars, webtoon I love you but c'mon...it's very difficult to like you with the drop in story qualities in favor of more updates. I also take issue with the raise in fast pass from 5 to 7. $1.05 used to buy you two episodes. Now it'll only but you one and you'll have 3 coins left over forever. Raising to 7 just ruined the perfect divisibility all the packages had. I don't find myself enjoying the app anymore, I love reading some of them but others are getting ridiculous."
"I am unable to follow creators. I was able to follow a few from last year, but I noticed I couldn't go to any creator pages to follow them this year. I sent two seperate emails to get some answers, but no one answered either one. Hopefully someone will see this and reach out. I would really like to find a fix for this."
This app is okay not the best reading app as the fast pass is kind bs maby im just over reacting but i cant read the newest episodes of a series i like because they cost in app currency that you have to pay for maby add a way to watch ads for coins ? i used to like this one more when i was younger and it was easier to ready a complete series with out paying or waiting over a month for them to unlock so kindly FIX THIS and my rating will go up for now itll stay two stars
My favorite and the best comic app ever😍😍❤️❤️ it's great that it's been resolved now. thank you :) Edit: it's been a great experience so far but why is it that I can't new updates and some other series; it just keep on loading. while I can read others just fine. It's happening since Thursday plz fix this it's very disappointing and unpleasing 😞 I want you to fix this as soon as possible I can't to read my fav webtoons😣🥺
"I have no problem with the comics. However, the notification from this app (especially some romantic comics that translated to Bahasa Indonesia) is making me uncomfortable."
"There are some really amazing and fun to read stories on here! The variety is great and I can always find something. However quality has dropped in popular webcomics and the prices have went up. This does not make sense to me as someone who uses this app daily. If comics are being produced with poorer content why do I need to pay more? If good webcomics are being shafted because Webtoon intends to milk its readers dry, what is the point?"
"I used to love this a lot, but daily pass is making it so difficult to enjoy a lot of comics that I'd love to reread. It's become so exhaustive :c"
"Daily Pass ruined this app, I don't mind paying for content but paying for every single episode of a 300+ series or waiting a full year to read all of it is insane, add a subscription service where we can get like 50 or 100 daily passes a day"
"Only reason I'm giving Webtoon 2 stars is because of 1. The daily pass system But most importantly 2. Webtoon cancelled the creators reward program, so Canvas Creators are no longer making any money. I mostly read canvas, so a lot of my favorite series are, in short, going bankrupt."
"The stories lines and art are chefs' kiss! HOWEVER, almost every artist has a patron account that they hold back peices of the story for. At $5-10 a month, per artist, it is just freaking ridiculous. It takes weeks to get to the next episode, even if it's already up, unless you buy coins and pay per episode to read it sooner. Also, some episodes are so short. It's frustrating. I LOVE Manta app much better! Flat monthly rate to veiw everything they have and no wait time on episodes if it's comple"
"I really like Dropbox overall but I can't play my videos on the app and this is a major inconvenience. Their passwords app is buggy and inconsistent too. I pay a decent amount for this service and they should do better. I'm also frustrated when they assume that I haven't tried all the basic steps such restarting, uninstalling/reinstalling, checking for updates, etc. before assuming it's an issue on their part. They did just release an update that has fixed the video problem for now."
"I love being able to open my files anywhere i may be. It's great for work and personal use.. but lately, when i try to upload a batch of files, only a few go through and the rest stay stuck in limbo... my wifi is stro g and if I'm using my phone data, my signal is just as good if not better typically.. i have no reason why this is happening at this point and its frustrating.. especially when I pay to have 2TB of storage and can't use it.."
"I pay for this app, and I mainly use it to back up my photos. But, I just got a random notification asking me to scan docs for tax season. I clicked the notification, it proceeded to open my camera and start scanning photos. Why? There's not even an option to turn just that type of notification off, so I just turned off all notifications for Dropbox. Annoying."
"Doesn't do it's only job: Synching files. It's just an app for accessing files from the dropbox servers while connected to the internet, but fails to keep offline files or directory trees, and doesn't cache files locally where you could browse/edit them with the app you actually want to use. The interface is also utterly dumb, eg re-opening itself all the way back at its root when you just want to move a file into an adjacent subdirectory. At least you can access your txt files while online."
"I used to use Dropbox as my main way of syncing my KeePass database between devices, but I no longer see Dropbox as a viable option. Dropbox has become infested with marketing, trying to get you to purchase their subscription model. In addition, their desktop programs and apps have become unstable. I will instead use Google Drive for it's increased accessibility, stability, and the fact that it allows for infinite connected devices instead of dropbox's limit of 5."
"I've been a user since Dropbox started. Now it's clunky, and they don't create features for the sake of ease of use, but rather to get you to buy stuff. It certainly doesn't synch when you need it to. Dropbox has gotten complacent, to the point that I've actually started using Microsoft's Onedrive. That's pretty bad."
"Videos are completely broken. A still frame from a different video is stuck on the screen while the chosen video plays out of sight in the background. I've also noticed similar broken behavior in the iPad app. This has been going on for a long time now - please fix your software, Dropbox."
"This used to be a great app. In the past, it was so easy to export files to different apps. But now, the export function is only visible when you select the file, then click on the options under the 3 dots. Even then, files always fail to export so I end up having to download the file onto my phone first. Before, you had the export option while viewing the file. Why would you change that when it was so convenient before? Tired of the inconveniences and non functional features."
"I've been using Dropbox for years. However, I am beginning to contemplate switching to a different storage service. Whether I use it on the computer or in the app, it only lets me move 15 pictures at a time to their respective folders. If I try to rename a picture, it corrupts it and is gone forever. Dropbox is starting to really suck."
"Personally, I don't really like it. I find it confusing and couldn't figure out how to log out to make a different account (Mines kinda went bad and I had to remove all of my backed up pictures). Though I may just find it confusing from how little I use it. I also think you're given too little space (While I do have a lot of photos, I still think 2GB is too little for standard plans)."
"I've had it for years and used it periodically but never exclusively. Recently, I've needed it for a little project or mine and I noticed something that driving me completely bonkers. When downloading, anything really, there's NO PROGRESS BAR! Nothing! 😡 So I have no idea when the process will finish. I can't even tell if for some reason the process froze or got hung up. Im having to go in and out of the destination folder and watch the folders item count to see when it stops increasing. 😐😐😐"
"Dropbox would be great if the app functioned reasonably well. I have had the same problem with downloading files for years now. Whenever I go into a fullscreen view of a photo, and scroll through them to download them individually, many times what will happen is it will download two copies of the same photo as opposed to downloading the two DIFFERENT photos that I individually selected. I've had this issue for about four or five years now on many 📞's, and it's making me consider an alternative"
"I use to love Dropbox, but over the past 6 months or so not, so much. It will not auto upload my photos or videos anymore. I have to open the app on my phone, goto settings, and then it might start. Been using Dropbox for years, I never had these issues before. I have not changed my settings or anything in years. I almost want to stop using it all together. ☹🙁"
"Dropbox the service is awesome. I've been using it since it was new. The mobile app however leaves a bit to be desired. I should NEVER lose access to offline files because the app got a network connection for a few seconds. That is honestly the entire reason for the low rating. If the program gets connectivity long enough to access the server, but it's a poor connection or just doesn't have time to sync fully, I lose access to my offline files."
Used to be amazing. Only use the mobile I tend to ignore it on my PC and I loved the ease of finding files. I only really use it for word files. Lately though it has taken to corrupting my files. One would only open in flow.....witch is an app for tracking periods and as I didn't change the file extension and was only trying to rename the file I have no idea how that even happened. As it has happened more than once in the same month though I will likely check out a few different apps.
"I use dropbox all the time to share albums. Since the update, you can't preview the images (says the file is too large to preview...it NEVER said that before) and now it's a whole process to download the files. Let's not get started on finding the files once they've downloaded. Definitely not worth $12/month anymore and definitely looking for a new, better way to share files."
"No option to store offline files on SD card. If there is storage is on SD card I can have more files offline. It feels like the developers are self sabotaging their own feature. Sometimes all the offline files have to be downloaded again. Don't understand why this happens. The new interface for a video makes it harder to open it in an external app. This feature got removed in the recent editions of the app and now I have to grow the 3 dots menu. Please bring it back. Otherwise, the app is good."
"Free version allows you to use very little storage space. Fine, whatever, pay for the full version- app crashes, still have certain features locked for higher payment, the ui is very clunky and difficult to navigate, its constantly struggling to keep up with the most basic actions ie. moving files from one folder to another, uploading a bulk amount of files into folders, renaming folders, the list goes on. its very frustrating to work with"
"Im not sure where my music files went. Been using the app for years to sync my music files between devices. Now all of my playlists are broken on my phone because the music has disappeared from my phones storage. Hopefully they'll fix this soon. UPDATE: They have changed how their service works and it is no longer the service I paid for, which is really a shame, since it was very convenient as a sync tool. It's just a backup tool now."
"The app has become increasingly NOT user friendly. It's OK for storage only, thus the two stars. Used to be albums for picture sharing were easily made. Some jpg files I'm unable to share for some reason. Ie., I added jpg files from elsewhere to the 'camera' folder. From there, while creating an album for sharing, those jpg files are not available. Moved to Google Drive, easily done there."
"I can't stand Dropbox, the only reason I'm using it is for an app. It's not user-friendly, if you want to delete photos you have to pick them one by one. and I can't stand how much they push the premium version all throughout the whole app everywhere you go. As soon as I'm finished with the work that I need to do with this app I am going to uninstall Dropbox as soon as I possibly can. Google drive is superior in always."
"I have been using Dropbox for many years....even pay for extra storage. I record a lot of music videos and for the last few weeks when selecting any video, audio from a different video plays at the same time. It seems to be completely random and it doesn't matter which video I select...it always happens on my Android device. The issue doesn't exist on the iPad or PC apps."
"Everyday I find something irksome with this app. The Dropbox service is great, but this app is full of problems. It takes years to upload things - if they upload at all, spontaneous ""storage full or unavailable"" errors when trying to download, syncing issues, issues moving files, issues renaming files, issues exporting files. It never ends. You're better off just going to the website and working with your files there."
"I used it for years but have stopped subscribing. It's just gotten far too expensive for me now and whenever I add new files, they are too hard to find. (Don't seem to show at the top of my ""recents"".) It's much easier and more economic to use a physical external hard drive or a competitor's cloud system."
"This app sucks. Sure you can allow it to upload pictures from your phone and view them, but that's it. It always has issues with the connection suddenly every time I try to download photos back on my phone or upload documents or try to manage and organize anything stored in it. It can't even move one file to another folder within the app. Better have access to a PC if you want full use of this service. I don't and now I stand to lose everything stored on it if I stop paying for it. USELESS!"
"Less than stellar. Paid $200 for 3T of storage and some collaboration features. Both the app and the website buffer videos constantly. Doesnt make a difference if I'm on a PC or my phone, and LTE or wifi. Best of all, when the video stops to buffer, the clock continues to run without the video recovering to match the time. You can sit through a whole 30 second clip and not actually see anything. When I export to my phone, occasionally the videos will download with no sound. $200 dumpster fire."
"Most of the time, I can't get this app to sync files for offline use. It just says an unknown error has occurred and won't let me access any of my files. When I do get it to sync, it will sometimes try to update the files later in the background and fail, then I'm back to not being able to access any files. Very unhelpful when trying to access drawings on-site with no service or wifi. Most issues on Galaxy Tab S7, but also on LG V60."
"Use to be great. This app used to be amazing but now it has issues Dropbox doesn't know how or won't fix. As soon as I open a folder the entire screen shifts down to add at the top ""only you"" cause me to click on a file that I didn't intend to since the screen shifted. Also if I save a PDF file to Dropbox from an email it saves it as ""VIEW"" without the PDF extension at the end of the file name, so I'm forced to go back and rename that file every time. Google drive doesn't have these issues ever."
"Used to be great. The original intent was great, but in the never ending quest for more money they keep adding all these useless features no one cares about. I'd love to be able go back to the original. Love to be able to clear out storage without deleting, and put things on my end. SO Instead I will one day delete drop box and move to something more manual, I will also have all my employees do the same. Attn big tech, no one wants all this automation."
Very disappointed with the recent updates in audio playback. You can no longer playback audio with a lock screen/in the background. Major regression in my opinion. This feature used to exist but is no longer possible. I used to listen to music projects on dropbox while walking and running but that's become wildly inconvenient now that you can't listen with a locked phone. Is there any way around this? It's a horrible user experience for anyone working on and sharing audio projects.
"I feel that dropbox lags behind as a storage option for visual media. Whether photography or graphic art, as a user, I want to be able to view my content as an automatic Slideshow with presentation options (speed/transition effect between each item). This kind of feature would make dropbox a valuable tool for me as a photographer and designer. However, I also see bugs in the app on my phone. For one, every file I view now automatically shows me a comment field overlaying the screen (and my art)."
"File browser is incredibly unintuitive. There's not an obvious way to navigate up a directory. Or get to the root and see my folders once I've navigated down into a directory without completely closing the app. The ""Home"" screen feels like a complete waste of space. Like it was one of those ""Other apps have home screens so we will too."" If you want a ""Home"" screen so bad, remove the ""Home"" screen and rename the ""Files"" screen to home."
"I dislike being forced to sign up for the new Dropbox. You are given no choice in the matter, but to sign up, even though the app log in clearly states at the top choose your Dropbox options. And even though it says I can cancel at anytime, what will happen to my original dropbox. Will it go back to normal? I don't know. I'm not happy, but I had to sign up so I could access what photos I had stored."
"The Help section doesn't make any sense. I'm trying to export a file from Dropbox to an SD card. Your help sez ""If you are running Android 4.4 (or higher) you'll need version 2.4.5.10 (or higher) of the Dropbox app"". I'm running oS 8.0 and this is a way higher version number here. The rest of instructions are also not compatible with this version of Db. There is no ""more' in drop down menu next to file. Help!"
"Have been using Dropbox for years. Pay for 1TB. Can't ever transfer or move files without it saying ""can't transfer now"" or ""no internet connection"", which I of course have. I can only move about 20 pics at a time, and often only half of them get moved. Something that should take minutes, takes me hours (moving hundreds of pics to different folders). This has been going on for years with no fix, though many people complain of the same issue. It's ridiculous."
"This app used to be golden, but they keep ratcheting down services. The latest is that now, without a subscription (i.e. recurring fee), you are limited to 3 devices. I hope apps that use Dropbox for sync will drop them & broaden support for other cloud storage services. Just like other formerly great apps/services, Dropbox is one more example of how the Golden Age of mobile computing is sadly coming to an end. :-("
Forced to upgrade and no links. I agree with the other users I paid for the upgrade and something as simple as creating a link to my folders crashes the app now. It was working fine 2 months ago. And of course while trying to download my files to get ready to cancel my subscription I am getting error messages. I with take my chances with another service as soon as I can figure out how to get my data.
"Not the very best. I uploaded my photos and while I was exporting it to my device, the organization was a whole mess. I sorted out my exportation with ""By date"" and it is STILL a mess. And I also have my photos saved as when they were taken. I am not happy of how stressful it is to find a way to stop this while making a video. It is so annoying"
"The single most important utility of dropbox - transferring files from one decive to another - has been made as deliberately hard as possible. You'd think you could download your own files from your own drop box account to your own phone, but clicking download places files in a hidden temp folder. Delete them from dropbox, and it deletes those files (learned that the hard way). Also, they withhold the ability to download a whole folder at a time. Going to start looking for another app"
"To be fair, I'm using this app on a Chromebook, which is probably not the main target. However, my experience is that both it and Files integration are nearly useless, so bad that it's better to just use the website. Very frequently things will just fail to upload, for no apparent reason. It takes long enough to put things up without adding extra hoops to jump through first, so I'm going to uninstall this app."
"Dropbox app lost key scanning features. When I upgraded from the Galaxy S7 to S10, I found the new Dropbox app has poor scanning ability due to the loss of manual focusing and use of the flash. When I used the old version on the S7, I was able to save quality scans of any document, even in the dark. The PDF documents that the new version creates are blurry even when there is ample light. Dropbox, please bring back the manual focus and flash features. I depend on this app for work."
"I've been a paid member for about 5 years I would say and the UI hasn't changed much, if at all. Images and videos take too long to load even while using a solid WiFi connection. I wish it was more fluid like Google Photos. I would switch to them but I have too many files to transfer and no time so please make this app better before I make time to switch. Thank you!"
Turning off captions in the app would make it a lot better. Scrolling through pictures and having them cut off by the comments label showing up each time. I don't use comments so I should be able to turn them off. I have to tap on each image for it to go away and it shows up again once I swipe.
"Really good storage app, although 2gb isn't what it used to be (pcloud gives you 5, mega gives you 20) Still, great app for free cloud storage I recomend not putting things there you plan to shuffle back to the phone. It can be difficult to export from. When this was the only cloud storage app that worked it was the best. It's not aging well. Currently outshined by more then a few competing apps, my stars have decreased from 4 to 3 and now 2. It does work. It's moderately user friendly."
"Update: I cant upload any differnt file types. When it opens my recent files, it does not show all of them, only photos. Kind of useless. You can't even upload a normal file, for example google account services. Any file you upload from your device has to be a photo, wich kinda defeats the entire purpose of the app. Google one is way better, and on this app you only get 2 gb of storage before you have to spend money."
"For some reason Dropbox on Android cannot preview .wav or .mp3 files, but Dropbox on iPhones can. Please fix this. [Update after response from Dropbox] - I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times and deleted the cache. It still gives the same error for audio files - ""mp3/wav files can't be previewed, to open this file try a computer or another app""."
I regularly open pdf files in Acrobat via the editing option in Dropbox on my phone. It happened plenty of times that changes on documents are lost after switching to a different app. I have lost days of work in the last years highlighting and making comments on academic papers that are finally not saved. Very disappointing.
"Home tab has made itself useless, reducing the page from showing 6 files, sizes and last modified that can smoothly scroll to barely fitting 2 files with oversized icons. There is no way to change it to show a compact list even if all files are text files. If I wanted a photo manager I'd use a photo manager. Maybe its time to move on after 10 years using this."
"Tired of the endless glitches integrating with office 365, the offline files disappearing and general editing issues of docs within dropbox. Getting ready to move to another app. In response to your canned response below, I have reached out many times with occasional help from support iin fixing the issue, with a slightly inefficient solution....the problem is that I continue to face ongoing complications that are only temporarily resolved by clearing cache or wiping data (a huge waste of time."
"This used to be a great app, but the latest Android update has made it slow and unresponsive. Navigating folders used to be instant, but now the app often pauses for 15 to 30 seconds before showing the contents of a folder or enlarging an image from a thumbnail. Disappointing."
"I'm 72. This software, IMHO, rates as one of THE highest learning curves I have encountered in a LONG time. 😡NO TELEPHONE SUPPORT! All I could get for my efforts was the ubiquitous response that you get for most everything these days, referring to my having to jump through hoops asking questions in text online. ARTHRITIS PEOPLE; friend doing THIS for me😘. ""Voice-to-text"" you say? Voice box injured in Nam making it difficult for said technology to work for me😮‍💨. I use OneDrive now."
"Downloading to mobile is a nightmare, can't play music playlists, file mgmt is below basic. All their effort goes in new pointless features trying to extend and be evernote instead of addressing their own market properly. Ok cos it's stable and the MVP works but that's it. Too unfocussed and greedy, not enough focus on meeting basic user needs."
"I received an email from Dropbox marketing stating: Hello there, An important update for you regarding your account: Your files have stopped syncing across your devices because your Dropbox is full —You need more space in order to sync automatically with the cloud.Upgrade your Dropbox today, and get up to up to 3 TB (3,000 GB) of space. In fact, I only used 40% of 2 TB. Very dishonest."
"Very poor system. It's been a week, I'm unable to login my account due to systemic problem in two-factor authentication text message. I have registered my complaint via email but unfortunately they haven't resolved my problem yet. Once I get back my hold to account, I'm planning move out my data to another platform."
I love drop box and really enjoyed the years free trial i had.. but.. i feel the company needs to reconsider its plan options. 2tb for 9.99 a month is the cheapest and lowest storage and with the economy as it is i would really like to see them offering a 1tb for a lower amount option.. maybe 4.99 ?? Or even lower .. i dont need the 2tb monthly and i really cant afford 9.99 a month on a subscription .. food for thought?? (Made it 2 stars in an effort to get the creators attention) Thanks
"You're trying to force me to pay, and I am paying a fraction of that amount with Google and more storage. I also switched off camera load, backup, wifi upload, etc. The app is still loading my photos, even after deleting pictures to make space. I appreciate the service, but to experience that, and now you're charging in order for me to have more space? I find this suspicious."
"It used to load my photos really quickly when going back a few years, it was smart enough to update the preview grid based on what I was looking at, now it takes foreverrrrrr to load grid previews if you go back, it made the app useless basically, this makes me want to go to see elsewhere honestly..."
"Been getting an error lately from Google saying that the app doesn't comply with its secure browsers policy. I can access my files still, but only via Dropbox's viewer; I can't open them with the proper apps (MS Office, in particular)."
"The app is difficult to use and navigate. I'm now experiencing that the navigation bars (in gesture mode) on my Samsung tablet don't disappear when viewing an image, which is extremely annoying. It worked OK about two weeks ago."
"Worked great until last update when the editor converts my emoji and diacritics to chinese characters distorting my notes, please fix this and i will give it a 5 star. I use it almost daily for some documents that have romanian language which has diacritics and also some emoticons/emoji which now are chinese characters when i edit the document and go back to normal when i go back, but the copy paste function now is missing in the view document, only works if i edit the document with pencil icon"
"Updated a file on Dropbox OK, closed it down and switched off device later went to reopen same file on different device next day and can't get into it === tells me it's locked for editing!!!! Checked the file properties and it's definitely not read-only === DAMN FRUSTRATING SINCE YOUR LAST UPDATE!!!!!!"
I wouldn't mind the preview thing for .txt files if it didn't treat line breaks like a white space character. Everything is now running together. Need to put it into edit mode just to be able to read.
"I deleted all my drop box files to free up space. A week later dropbox still says it is full and constantly asks me to upgrade to a paid plan. No chance of that, I'll just uninstall dropbox and stick to google drive. You should too."
"Dropbox itself is not bad, the app is decent, but the camera upload is unbelievably bad UX in my experience, and that's what I most use the dbx app for, so 2 stars. I now see all my photos in one tab, mixing camera and images in my Dropbox; there is no indication if all my photos are backed up, there is no clear way to see if I can safely remove photos from the device, there is no a button to make device space available. It's... Annoying."
"it isn't very good for the beginner,the not yet good at doing down loads example I tried to download music the reason I got it ... tune's...n porn..the nesesety ... when planning a night z..but no data...no wi fi ...u need download for the very reason u get the app ...then I try use it n wast a good bit of time trying to get the hang of it ...I dj ..I can use an app n get good at it ...but it should say wot ir does on the tin ...all good ...n I wouldn't have wasted my last hit ..n dunt .💥🕳️😡"
"I think it's no better than any other storage , there are certainly much cheaper options around 2TB for £9.99 isn't very competitive, though they do dress it up as 2000 gig to make it sound a lot 🤣"
What in the world made you decide to include mail addresses in search results in the dropbox app?????? Half the screen fills up with mail contacts when you type anything in the search field! Completely useless anoyance in an otherwise ok app.
"How is 164% out of 2GB full? I'm trying to export all of my Dropbox and I won't use it again. Over 30% left but you freeze it, IMO, to force us to upgrade. I don't like huge businesses preying on people, and thats how I see it!"
It does not do what you think it would do: files are hidden internally in the app where no other app can find or access them. This is not what you get on a laptop or desktop. For me this renders it mostly useless.
"It used to be good but lately it seems like a bit sink, you drop files over there and are completely unable to download your own files without spending money to do so."
"Dropbox was my first cloud storage to use but over the years it started to become less and less mony demanding service ,i have no problem with buying a reasonable monthly subscription but i need more penifits and the way you removed storage capacity from the free subscription made me dislike dropbox and iam changing my paid subscription to onedrive for its penifits and reasonable prices I deleted one of my dropbox account but left the main one hopefully dropbox improves"
"Ok, service. But I'm trying to figure out how to stop google from charging me double for this. I get a google play subscription and one from dropbox after the trial was over. :| if I could go back I would never have google over this subscription."
Newest update is HORRIBLE. So much less efficient use of space. I'll be looking online for an older version to get rid of this garbage version.
"Sometimes when attempting to send & attachment , I can only access my Dropbox 1 time . Inconvenient if I need to attach multiple files, I have to send multiple emails because of this issu."
Same issue as Victor...won't open excel files. Says dropbox needs to be updated. Fix please.
"I've had Dropbox for years. I don't use like I use to. It's just hard for me to find pictures that are doubles or very similar Blurry, etc. I'm canceling."
Keeps crashing in my most accessed spreadsheet. I have to open it in Excel. I used to be able to just view it in Dropbox.
"Video playback doesn't work. There is always a frozen image of the next or previous video in the sequence covering the video that is currently playing. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, reset my phone, cleared the cache, and verified that I am on wifi. Apparently, I'm not the only one this has happened to."
"The trash can button is gone, and I can't add another account anymore. I use to have it added, but since you all took it off."
"It's so annoying they constantly spam your email daily (multiple times a day) and make it difficult to unsubscribe. I can't even unsubscribe from my phone, I have to via PC. Thank for the inconvenience."
"Not bad app, but a big cons is a Low preview pictures resolution, so you have to download the picture to see it in original quality."
"Very difficult to use on android tablet. Seems OK on laptop, but on tablet I tried to create a paper file and it saves it separately to all my Dropbox files and folders"
the newly added preview is time consuming even for offline file. the preview of txt file does not match layout in edit mode. the worst thing is preview cannot be disabled
For 100+ a year i need to be able to use the app and not have it crash every time i try to upload more then one photo.
US date format no good for UK. Hates making available off line. Spreadsheets garbled. Might be good for storing photos but not as a business tool.
Too many times my mobile device won't sync Dropbox account. Files i think should be accessible on my mobile pretty instantly are not.
"Frustrating for a our family project & forced to convert to single registrating to keep cloud storage used. No HELP AVAILABLE, and directed back to SALES who did not help with A tech staff help to complete the breakup purchased on a promo"
It's Expensive. I've been using this app for over 7 years now and i have all my document in there since then but recently i got out if storage and i looked at the prices are insane for a normal person to effort and the problem is there's only 2 choices you ether chose to pay 12$ per month and 120$ per a year there's no other choice like there's should be an option where you can buy the amount of storage you need for as long as you want. Every person knows how much storage he need and buy it once
"The scanning quality is really bad. Better off using camera app and then uploading the picture/pdf or use OneDrive etc. However, on plus side, the app is easy to use, works fast, and provides good amount of free storage."
"The app used to work well, but now video glitches when trying to stream / watch a video directly from my Dropbox app. Very unfortunate. I am a premium monthly subscriber to Dropbox, so if this isn't fixed asap, I will need to rethink my options."
"I downloaded it as a photo backup service but it doesn't seem to work right. It will backup photos for a while and then just stop. Since that was my primary reason for using the app, and it doesn't work, I give it a low rating and don't trust it with my precious photos."
"Unable to retrieve ANY of my backups. Even though I contacted support, they were not able to figure out how I could download any particular file. I'm moving to a different provider, even though canceling my subscription will destroy my data which is effectively held hostage."
"Dropbox disconnects from server constantly. tried to get ahold of someone to help me, but because my name isn't the one on the account (ex-friend set this up for me and she used her name instead of mine) I was informed they couldn't help me. even though it's my email and I could give info on the pictures on the account. Time to look for something else to store my hard work on."
I still never recieved anything for referring the app. I shared the app to receive more storage space and it never happened I shared it they downloaded it and now they use it but I never received the free extra storage space
sometimes files don't start to download and other times video files are randomly corrupted when downloaded.
"Right now I'm experiencing that when I click on a video on mobile, a screenshot of another video overlaps as the one I'm wanting to see is playing in the background. Kinda frustrating, please fix."
I can't play my videos in dropbox after the new update. It jumps to a previous video with just a still shot in the front while the video is in the back.
"I can't upload the whole album, also come across with video uploaded but can't play well even after restart my phone."
"I am using this app 8years but unfortunately app uninstall, redownload app,not done sign in.inot interested plus version pls sign my old dropbox.link my account."
"Not for me! But i bought into it. I think around $12 or $28? monthly..?Plus I thought was too expensive, and isn't this Dropbox more for people with computers? I don't and never will have one, this smartphone alone is taking up our lives. And because I was trying to find an expert with a different issue, installed Dropbox again but it's too hard to understand! At bottom says Tell us more, and can't even do that! Must be for computers? DB reply, Hey Gary, you're fos, I asked if DB is 4 computers"
"I love the selection of books, it's perfect for me. The big downside is the coin system is frustrating and seems like a scam. 1coin=1 page in a book. Sometimes you may need more than 1000 coins to complete a book. Also they offer free coins for doing things but sometimes it's very sketchy. Recently they were offering coins for a review but only if it was a 5 star review, which was stated after they deny your screenshot."
I really enjoy the books. However I barely use the app and I'm stuck partially through one book because of the amount of money it cost to read them. I jump on when I think about to get bonus so I can read the next chapter. I would probably give it five stars and use it daily if there was a monthly price that was reasonable or each chapter Cost Less.
"Thought this was a free site. It's not. Trying to check in doesn't work great, the videos you need to watch to get coins are sluggish at best. The coins that it takes to read a chapter or section is a lot. I wish I could just find a book and read it--FOR FREE. The counter that tells how long you read isn't correct. If you fixed that, I would raise the rating. The timer for reading still isn't working. Fix your issues please."
"They app it self is user friendly. You can find some awesome reads. I just wish there were mor options of rewards I have already spent nearly$100 in the last week or so just for one book and it's getting really tiring specially when the book as a lot of the same repeated story info in it instead of moving on with the storyline to chapter 235. It's also really irritating how one book just keeps repeating fat shaming in every chapter, I can't tell how many times I have thrown my phone or put it ⬇️"
"I honestly feel like I could buy every book in here as a hard copy for the amount of points I need to spend money on for 1-2 books. I don't think the point system is fair, there's no alternative to reading more chapters than the pinch of free points you get.. which depending on the book, could be only one chapter.. for anyone that truly reads, this app just draws you in and then tries to take your money. I don't foresee myself keeping this app, I just wish I could find these books elsewhere."
"The stories keep you interested and wanting to read more.. That I liked. Some of the stories I have read they really should proof read since even I found misspelled words and words that should have capitalized. The big problem I have is, having to buy coins to read on further. Very very frustrating. I would rather they give you a link to buy the book online or a paper version."
I wish either you'd finish a book before posting. A lot of us are avid readers that could read a book in a day or two. Waiting for the next chapter is quite frustrating. I am not done with the book yet. Still waiting. It's interesting but twisted. Your female doesn't stick up for herself or explain herself in the story on many occasions which shows their miscommunication. I was promised 30 points for this review and got nothing so keep that in mind.
"The ""books"" are ok. The one I'm reading had a novice author that can't keep the storyline out characters straight and is filled with grammar and spelling errors, but it's an OK read. The problem is I somehow thought I was reading a short story on Instagram and ended up paying $45 my first night trying to finish the book! Now I'm on Ch. 166, reading 1 free chapter every other day, with no end in site. Not worth the price!"
I don't like that the books are not completed I have started two books and neither one of them has been completed and it has been multiple days without updated chapters. So far I have invested well over $90 and have not been able to finish a book. After this I will no longer read books from any book app besides Kindle. You get sucked in and caught up in the money grab. The reader should be made aware of whether a book is completed or not before they invest time and money into these apps.
"The story I read was engaging and, aside from the bedroom scenes being way too drawn out, I did like the one I read. The low review is due to how many coins and bonus points it took to get through ONE story. 1,000 coins, with a (I think) 150 bonus points, for $9.99 got me through less than half of it. I ended up buying another 2,000 for $19.99 to finish the one story and then uninstalled the app. Entertaining, but not worth $30 per story."
"This app has such potential, as do the books. Not sure what the original language was but the translation to English is terrible. They need to be edited for repetitive content, punctuation, American slang and grammar, because it's almost like watching a train wreck. The coin system would be fine if a ""chapter"" were more consistent in cost or if the chapters were more than a 4-6 minute read. At 3 chapters a day it'll take me 1.9+ years to read 1 book that could be a 90 minute B movie.0 bonus"
The books are intriguing. I'm not one to read at leisure but the topics and storyline had a way of gettin to me and I can't stop. I am a little bent back on the whole paying in increments to unlock a chapter. I don't ever recall havin to pay $20 just to read half a book...which leaves me to only give 2 stars. I may have to delete this app becuz of the costs and end up getting a library card.
"Terrible service, required to purchase by the chapter pretty much. It's ridiculous, they have a bonus feature that allows you to accumulate points in order to make purchases but that feature hadn't worked correctly since the second day using the app. There are better less expensive apps out there with much better content. Still trying to finish my first book by just using free points. 2 weeks in without an end in sight and I try to use it each day at least twice a day. It feels like a scam."
"I am editing my review because I have come across more stories on the app. The first one I started is good. Minimal errors. Good writing. I was impressed. However, other stories do not also have these two things. Many have an abundance of grammatical, spelling, and word choice errors. Not only do I recommend adding ads as an option to continue reading chapters, but if you're going to charge people, make sure the content is good."
"Adoring the book I started. However, having to wait to get enough bonuses in order to unlock another chapter is rather bothersome. Especially when the bonus points from the tasks don't get credited properly. One direction is to ""refresh"" so it updates. It has no such option unless it's hidden somewhere? I've tried cleaning the cache and rebooting the phone. Nothing. Please consider a view ad option to unlock the chapters. The way you have it now, I'm going to lose interest and go elsewhere."
"I have changed my 5 star review. It's now been just shy of 2 months since I downloaded it and I'm annoyed at how freaking EXPENSIVE it is. I love reading, like the written word is my true love type thing. So, I gave this a app a whirl. There are some truly amazing stories, however, the pricing does not average out. Some books are completely... definitely in need of a proper editing, and they cost an absorbent amount. It's ridiculous and I'm not playing that anymore. They need a sub option."
"Potential, but needs more. The books will not pick up where you left off, so you constantly scroll through what you previously read. Needs more options for free reading, such as ""watch an ad to unlock next chapter."" Or cross app promotions to get coins. The writing is generally bad, but the story lines do have some appeal to keep you interested Needs a lot if work, but could be really good"
"Some of the stories are really good. However, if you find a book you really like, it takes so long to get through it. And if you pay for coins, its not only expensive but it screws with the bonuses for the amount of time you read. I have read couple hours straight after purchasing coins and go back to collect the read for 15 mins and 45 mins and realize it says i only read 3 minutes. Its so frustrating. They are adding ways to get more coins which are nice. Chapters seem too short too."
"Don't waste your money or time I've spent around 60$ just one 1 story. And I'm not even halfway through as it keeps getting new ""chapters"" the book is awesome. However, each ""chapter"" is maybe equivalent to less than 10 pages of a real book. Only reason for the 2 stars is ONLY because of how good the book is. However it's still NOT worth my time or money to keep reading."
The introduction (free) chapters are long and get you hooked on the storyline. Subsequent chapters are only a few paragraphs long and very expensive to read. Decided to drop $10 on credits thinking that should suffice to cover the cost of a novel. I'm completely out and according to the app have only read 3% of the book. Absolutely NOT worth it. I can get Kindle Unlimited for the same price and read multiple books each month.
"I've only read one story and I refuse to read any others. I simply want to finish the one I started. It's much more expensive than if it was a hard cover novel. Although the story is good, the content is clearly not edited. I wish they just sold the book in It's entirety. I'd buy it and not have to wait for chapters which is annoying especially when you're invested in the story. I also enjoyed the audio which stopped working making it harder to continue the story. Too expensive to recommend."
"The stories are fun to read but the app itself is a nightmare, I have to completely close the app to get out of a story, the rewards process is confusing (read for 20 minutes according to an actual clock but it doesn't count towards the rewards for reading time) There just seem to be a lot of glitches and bugs that need work to make it a more enjoyable app."
"I don't see why I have to spend money on coins just to read one chapter that is less than 10 pages than an actual book you buy in bookstores. The ""chapters"" are great, besides repetitive dialogue or the author forgetting the plot of the story, but not something I would spend money on. Not signing in every day just to earn points to read a book or two at the same time, it gets very confusing after a while."
I have found a few books that I love.. but the amount of money I have spent to read them is astounding They give no other way to complete offers or wait or watch adds or get coins other than checking in.. at that doesn't cover the cost of most of the chapters! I'm finishing my current book because it really has been good and moving on because I just realized I have spend $30+ on 1 book!!!! It is ridiculous. At least with Readict you can do tap joy to complete offers and get more coins!!!
"I originally gave 5 stars. My opinion changed since I started a book that was 60+ chapters, and labled ""complete"". Misleading me, wasting $ and time. It was an excellent read. The story was captivating/exciting/emotional. Although it contained a couple minor errors, the good outwighed the flaws by far. Until it was cut short, obviously not finished though it says "" you have reached the end of this book"". In the comments, the author said he would edit the errors and finish, 7 months ago."
Got hooked on a book that was a bit cheesy romance novel but enjoyed it as I haven't read much in a while and I used to be an avid reader. Overall not impressed with the price and not sure I will be purchasing anymore books. I am about 3/4 of the way through and it appears as if the translator (book clearly wasn't originally in English and has been translated) has terrible ADHD. Randomly the names are different and the Grammer and spelling has gotten increasingly worse. I won't be finishing it
"I don't like the fact that you can't read the whole book without having to buy coins, watch videos, etc.... that's why I refuse to invite friends to this app. I can read full books straight through without having to get more coins or anything, on my Kindle fire through Amazon Prime, for FREE so, that's what I've been doing lately. If I have to buy coins to read a book, I may as well go to Walmart and buy the actual book!!"
"The English translation is good, well for the book I'm reading. BUT I wish I can just scroll down the chapter instead of slide or tapping my phone for the next page. It's an inconvenience. And seems like there's alot of review of the app being too expensive. I will most likely delete this app after I finish all the free chapter on the book I'm currently reading."
"While it is a great idea and I'm loving the stories, this is NOT a budget friendly app by any means. It is quite expensive. I canceled my subscription to this and will be switching back to Amazon Prime and Audible. Consider a REAL subscription service, where people can actually enjoy reading the books without fear of running out of coins... I know you all have to make money, but the rates you are charging are astronomical... It's truly a shame, because you have some great content!"
"Hooked with a few chapters but its expensive, theres no telling if the book has an ending or if they just keep going to try to get you to purchase more chapters. My guess is that it keeps going. A best selling book is usually 20 to 30 dollars, these can easily go over that never reaching an end, and there are alot of errors. I dont mind supporting authors but there comes a point where its just overpriced. Beware!"
I love most of the books but they are EXPENSIVE! It's like over $30 per book. And when I got a new phone I have loaded $50 dollars on my acct and it erased all of it plus the 30 plus books I've read. I'm very disappointed. Then you message them to try to recover and they just don't respond to you. I think it's time to start looking for another app or option.
"Finally found a book I was really interested in. And I'm not a reader. But this whole coin system or having to pay to read a book is for the birds. I'm very low income as I'm disabled and this doesn't work in budget. So I have to forget abt this book unfortunately. I thought this app was good at first, but my hopes were dashed. There's ways to keep apps running and this isn't one to keep customers/readers happy."
"The books on the app are great, the only problem is that the app is impossible to navigate through, and there is nothing to teach you how to navigate through it, there doesn't seem to be a way to add a book to your library even though the app says you can, there's no button to view notifications, so if you leave a comment on a certain page or wanna see if your book has updated or not good luck, because three no way to check and see, if goodnovel sees this, PLEASE add an app guide, it'd help alot"
"The book is good however, there is to much repetition of who did what and why it was done. In a sense it's too make the book even longer and to charge the customer more money. It feels like it's a theft on the customer. This book has lost its value too many different things makes it hard to stay in a good area, to many story lines with no ending, fell far from the character with a never ending story. 💔"
"Started the story and was captivated by it , but after a while they wanted money to keep reading. I paid a couple times but each time there was less story , finally figured out this book was being written and certain chapters were for sale , thats fine but it kept dragging on and on like this review. I never did finish reading, I'll wait till actually published , if the price is right."
"You should be able to unlock an entire book. Not pay an insane amount to do each chapter consecutively especially when details change in the stories and there is 0 editing on anything from grammar to spelling. Also the App doesnt work all the time. It keep popping up with an ""failed"" message so I cant open any chapters or recieve points. Disappointing. I am afraid to redownload since i have seen others loose all of their previous unlocked chapters."
The books are decent and long enough to keep you busy in another world for a while. However it takes way to long to build up the coins it would be nice if we just had an ad in between chapters. Also the coins expire after a few days so of you forget to long in or don't use the coins almost immediately then you lose them. Also it would be WAAAAAY easier and less expensive to just go to your local book store and buy a book.
"Books are way to long. If you want to spend $200 for a book that has errors and drags on this is the site for you. On another note, I paid $20 to renew. The book I was reading back tracked over 100 chapters. Ever chapter you read takes away your points you buy, anywhere between 10-30. When I had to scroll to where I left off I was then out of points all of a sudden. I contacted support with no reply."
Not impressed. I like the story and got hooked and really wanted to finish. I was willing to pay but where I was extremely agitated is that you have no idea how much it costs to reach the end of the story. I should have the knowledge and option of what I want to purchase not just a blind leap. The content of the storyline is the only reason it got 2 starts not 1.
"I love the stories, but it's impossible to actually read through. The price goes up each chapter so when I originally thought it would be a $10 book, it looks like it'll be close to 30 or 40. I'm not against buying books, but not being able to tell how much it will be to unlock the whole novel is ridiculous. I prefer buying a book on Kindle or a paperback, no interruptions and no sneaky greedy prices. I'm midway through one and I don't want to pay another $30."
"Very irritated. While the book I started to read had a good story to it, there was many errors in the story. Does any one review these before they are submitted? The characters names kept getting switched. Also why are the chapters worth different amounts? You should probably warn people that most of these are not even completed storied. So you waste your money to not even be able to finish the story."
"I like the ""novels"" but they are too over priced. Also, since the new update came out I haven't been able to get to a next chapter. Every time I scroll to the next chapter it comes up with a 'failed' message but still takes my coins. With an app you really need a better way to address issues like this. There is no contact or customer support of any kind."
"Book is ok, but the cost is ridiculous and now when I'm barely halfway through the app isn't working and neither is the website. I've spent over $200 on this book, I've dealt with the constant micro transactions, etc etc, but this is incredibly bothersome and unacceptable for the cost of the read.... Update... It's 6/5/21 and probably about another $1-200 dollars more on this same one book, still not done with the book, and the app is down again. Very frustrating."
The books are great. However I haven't received my daily bonus for past two days nor did I get my bonus for checking in again on the website. Also it's not fair I have to pay for each chapter especially when some are just a few paragraphs that cost more than previous chapters. Thinking of deleting since I can't get my bonus coins and my gems just disappeared. Please fix these problems and you may have more readers. So far very disappointed!!!!!!
"Started reading, it was unedited, lots of errors including characters mixed up but it was a good story! They want money for ""coins"" to read the book & the book is not finished according to other reviews for that specific book. Others had spent more then $50 trying to finish one book and never got the satisfaction of knowing what came of the characters. Sorry not worth my money for a run on book, I'd rather have it separated into a series. I would pay for a finished book! Back to Amazon I go"
"I used to love this app, but the cost for the chapters just keeps going up. There is some great stories, minus some grammer problems, and I get hooked on them. But when it takes all day to earn coins just to turn around and it only unlocks one short chapter, it's not worth it to me anymore."
"There are a bunch of good stories, but the grammar and spelling are pretty terrible in most of them. There were a few I had to stop reading because they were so bad. They also just changed the 'system', so instead of watching one ad to read one chaper (limit of 2 per day per book), now you have to watch 2 ads per chapter. Not happening. Most of the ads are full 30 second ads and some are even for scam products. AND one of the books I was reading simply disappeared. Super frustrating!"
"The stories in the app are interesting and good reads. BUT the cost to unlock each chapter is ridiculously priced. 35, 40+ even 50 coins to read a chapter. Some chapters are short. There have been much feedback on the number of coins needed to unlock new chapters and yet it still remains high. Another issue is that I cannot save or archive a fully read book in a different section so that the main section only shows books yet to be fully read. All read and unread books are mixed on landing page."
The story I started to read is great. However to finish this book as apprently it has over 2000 + chapters is going to cost me a small fortune! As every chaper is super short and you need coins to read the next and the coins are ridiculously expensive. You get a few free ones by logging on everyday and watching adds but no wear near enough to finish a story. Absolute money pit! Just get a book for a fraction of the price from amazon.
This isn't the best reading app but not the worst either. My biggest issue is that you don't get to keep the bonus coins for more than 7-10 days. Other apps allow you to keep coins indefinitely and allow the coins to be used to unlock a full book through one transaction.
Don't bother getting this app . Got sucked into the book to Find out it will cost you big bucks to read more than a couple of chapters A-day. I'm about 1/3 of the way through the book and so far have spent over $40. In stores I could purchase 3 books for that amount of money. It would cost me three times that amount to finish this book. So I am uninstalling this app.
Story is great and makes me want to read more. Upset you have to pay in to read because the ads haven't worked in days so I don't always get free chapters. I've tried for days to watch ads but it just freezes and won't load any. After I'm done with this book the app will be deleted
"Don't even bother w this app. It's a total waste of money. If you just wait for the coins & bonuses, you are allowed 2 chapters per day. If you buy coins to read more chapters, you will pay about $200 for what is essentially a good paperback romance novel that continues to update & the chapters are short. I'm deleting this app after this review. I will not pay another dime. Luckily, I have only put $10 into this app, but many others have put much more into it."
I'm not the happiest with this app. I used to love the books they had available until I realized how often plagiarism is allowed and encouraged. I only stay on the app bc a couple of my fave authors still have books that are exclusive to the app and the only way I can read them now. I've had books I've paid for disappear from my library and take forever to get added back. The responses I've seen to comments and complaints were not up to par either. Very disappointing.
Was reading book it was pretty good. They charge you for reading and you have to pay for coins. Rather expensive if you ask me. Wish we could get coins by watching ads .. I read a whole book in another app by watching ads.
"Too much money, I have been reading a really great book, but I have spent over 100 dollars in doing so. I think this is way too expensive. It is a really great book and I would love to finish it but I will be deleting the app and I will hope that the book comes out on Readict. At least there I can buy a 7 day reading pass. If Good novel had something like that at the same price as readict then I would consider coming back. Good novel just doesn't have that many options."
"Of recent, I have been unable to log into my library on a new device with the error message server not available. On my existing device, I could still see my library of books, but moving to the next chapter in each novel is always failing. The same error message server is not available. What could be the problem?"
While I enjoy reading the novels on the app. I'm getting the impression they either want you to stop reading or are trying to get more out of you. They increase the bonus required to read the next chapters and remove options for buying smaller coins. This is quite discouraging for me. Please do better.
"The chapters for the book I was reading where getting pricy so I decided to wait and ""check in"" on a daily basis to claim my 20 credits and stack them up. So i can finish the book once i have all yhe credits i need. It NEVER goes passed 70 credits. Over night it resets back to 50 so I'm never able to get more. So I have to read a chapter a Day and wait the a day or 2 when I get more credits."
"I liked the Charismatic Charlie Wade but get very irritated to only get 0, 1, or just 2 chapters at a time. Can we not have at least 4 chapters at a time? And to keep from repeating previous text in over half of the new chapters? Thanks so much. I am an avid reader. God Bless."
"The Book is good, but after reading a few chapters, and really enjoying the book, I was locked out and had to pay $10.99 to continue. This I did without a problem, but the very next day, I was locked out again, with the expectation that I pay $9.99 to continue. What on earth is that? Highway Robbery! You are doing your readers and authors a disservice by pulling such a scam. I would end up paying hundreds for 1 book! This is a problem for ALL your readers! SHAME ON YOU! DO BETTER!!!!!"
"I am really tired of reading this book. Love at first sight. The book started off good, but as I continue reading, I am just tired of the book. How many times in this am i going to read about Hank and Liberty's marriage? The two are divorced, but yet the marriage is always mentioned. I am presently reading chapters 923 over half of the book. all the money that I spent reading basically the some words over and over again. I would rather have got the book from Amazon. For a whole lot less."
"Don't bother reading unless you want to spend a lot of money on 1 book. I will finish the book I started and it will take me months to finish for free. What a waste!! Don't bother, but if you want yo waste your time, try it. Yiu will see what I mean very quickly!! App sucks!!"
I love the stories but the fact that the app boasts about bonuses that are never delivered and the cost of coins to be able to read the chapters are ridiculous and the number of coins it takes to reach chapter is ridiculous yes there are free books but the vast majority of those are put together like there's no such thing as all of the ones with a compelling storyline are not worth the price anymore
"I love some of the authors and I absolutely love the books they write but the amount that it cost for each chapter is absolutely ridiculous. Plus, everyday you check in you only get 20 coins (chapters cost more than 36 coins) and they don't up it for everyday you check in even if you're checking in every single day."
I have mixed reviews because honestly I love some of the stories that were recommended to me on Facebook that's why I downloaded this app but it is more expensive to read these books off the app than to just purchase a novel from Amazon. I think in total on one book because there was so many short chapters it ended up costing me over $100 to read it and I'm sorry that's just really expensive for a book.
"I give a 2 because of the prices. MOST books in a ""store"" run about $15-$35 Here Nope Over $50 wont get you 25% through Some. Chapter length varies by IDK who but it is ridiculous. Bonus points do not even cover a chapter at times but if it does its so short or not even a chapter just a section, even I as probably the slowest reader here can finish it in 2 mins or less. The 2 is for some really good writers, others need to work on repetitive information that has already been mentioned 1M times"
The book I'm reading is really good but I don't think I will be able to finish. I have had several web novel apps like this and I have not had to spend money to this degree for coins. I will be quite disappointed if I can't finish this book when I have already put 10 dollars in and that is what a typical e-book is.
Got very interested in one book. I finally spent $5 to be able to read the whole thing uninterrupted. Who knew it will probably cost 5x that. I'll read a chapter a day till finished then delete app. It shouldn't cost near that to read a digital book.
"Since the last update ""watch ads to unlock chapter"" has been removed and it's been difficult for me to unlock chapters by the bonus which we get by checking in I'm only able to read one chapter in one day and it's quite frustrating Please get back the option of unlocking two chapters in oneday on each book!"
At first this app is very good I even purchase coin everytime I pick good story...but now the adds is so annoying. It said 2 adds to open the locked chapter...now its always 4 to 6 adds pop up before you can open the chapter...must fix this to gain more readers....
"I had to edit this review as this issue has been a real hassle for me. Although there's such a huge selection of really good books to choose from. I've been bouncing between books. There aren't enough options to ""earn"" free coins on the app to help you at least finish more than 1 chapter of 1 book per day. Since 1 chapter gets to be 35 or 41 coins who can actually afford to use this app happily? I'd much rather buy the book from a bookstore. This app is costing me too much."
"The books are good, but having to purchase coins to read them is frustrating. I like the story lines, but can't finish the book without purchasing coins. The daily bonuses aren't enough."
"The novels are good! But reading here is just too expensive! I already paid a big amount and yet it still didn't cover at least 1 novel. Thus I can't finish even 1 novel. This is just too much if you're working on a budget coz this is way expensive than Netflix and Disney plus subscription even combined. Too bad, need to let go and uninstall now. I will not be tempted to spend too much on this anymore. Hehehe K bye!"
Too expensive to read books (which are never ending) on this app. I've paid $15 to read to chapter 156 and received notice that chapter 2405 is now downloaded. I'm going back to kindle unlimited where I can read as many books as I want for $9.99 per month!
Like reading the story.buy it is annoying to have to try and watch adds to be able to read more. Then the adds won't play. And you can not get out of the. 😡. This is supposed to be free. It is not true.
"chapters are short. And the cost of coins to read them are ridiculous. You get 15 to 20 coins for a bonus, 5 for 30 minutes and by then you have ran out of coins, to read the next chapter. At least give 30 or 40 points bonus and drop the price for chapters that are 5 paragraphs long."
I was enjoying the books until today....I purchased some coins today.. there used to the option to watch the ad to read next chapter but now it's not showing that it changed completely?? I want to know whhyyy???
"I would have rated you 5stars but I'm disappointed. I paid for coins twice, 19.99$and 9.99$ on 18th but up to now, no single coin has been added to my account. The app is great but your system is really terrible. I'm still waiting for the coins to be put in my account and it's been a week now."
Starting reading a book. Got intrigued in the book. Couldn't go further cause I needed more points. Paid $14.95 and no where near the end of the book and no more credits. I could have bought the whole book for this price. 😩
I have been reading the same novel for the past few days and fail to understand how there can be so many chapters?I have paid$30 US which equates to $60 NZdollars.For this amount I can purchase up to three books with no grammatical errors like the book that I am currently reading.I am now required to purchase more coins so that I can continue reading this novel which i find way too expensive.The author should really look at getting an expert review done.She has way to much content per chapter
I don't like the coin system. I love reading but due to the amount of chapters the books game I'm be paying way to much just to read one book. Can the developers find a better system so that we can read more without paying so much
"I love the book 📖 I'm reading, but there are absolutely too many grammar mistakes. You have to pay by the chapter for the good books 📚 and the boring ones you can buy the entire book. When you make a comment or a grammatical correction or suggestion, no one replies to your comment or correction of the error. More work needs to be done before releasing a book."
"They have some good stories but I hate them ripping readers off. They put the rate on special but deducted you full price. I purchased 1500 points plus 300 bonus and kept tracked on every chapters , It only allows me 61 chapters to read which if you calculate basing on 22 points per chapter only cost just over 1300. So where's the rest of it?"
I started reading a story. It's good but chapters are too short and charge 22 coins per chapter. I bought 500 coins ($4.99) and can only 22 chapters. Every day you get 20 coins plus 3 coins per add/ 5 per day. Over all can only read 1 chapter per day. I don't want to spend more money ..
I like the books I've tried to read. But Im getting tired of having to either read a chapter then wait sometimes days or watch a bunch of ads. It said free reading and it's not.
"It's okay. I really enjoy the book I'm reading but to unlock chapters' costs coins... you only get 20 a day, but most chapters cost 22. Each chapter is like a page long. If I have to buy coins I'll end up spending hundreds just to read 1 book!?"
"I like the book ,but not the app. I have spent almost $30 cash and still haven't been able to finish the book. Earn points by reading you don't even get to read for 15 minutes for the amount of coin get from checking. ☹️"
Though the book is good i revise to pay that much just to read a book. I can buy a book for 1/100 of what it would cost to finish and over 5000 chapters... please that is ridiculous. Good thing I can easily walk away.
"The varying price range for each chapter has no rhyme or reason behind it. Chapters are anywhere from 12 coins (lowest I've ever seen it- but its Extremely rare) to 110, but generally in the 50-70 range. It has zero ability to learn what genre(s) you are interested in and just recommends whatever. Chapters take anywhere from 3-9 minutes to read but you can sometimes stretch that to 15 and the timer tracker is Extremely skewed and off"
EDIT*** there are only a bunch of good reviews bc you get ONE free chapter only if your review is 5 star! Sooo expensive!!! Enough coins to buy one book is about 500 USD!!! The daily check ins don't even give you enough to read ONE chapter! The chapters are very short and books have more than 2000 chapters! I'm so upset I'm into this book and the cost of it is downright absurd.
"The books are decent, but the point system sucks. I'm reading a book that requires 15-20 points to read the next chapter, and that next chapter is super short. A few paragraphs maybe before it is already requiring more points. This is what makes people get tired and makes them stop using your app I will not spend that much money to keep reading just a couple paragraphs. And waiting daily just to read one chapter is gonna get super old super quick."
If it wasn't so much extra coins or bonus coins whichever it would be a really good app but it's like you get to read one chapter just to have to pay to read the next. I thought it was supposed to be a free book app??
Quite the scam. You can earn credits daily but if you don't use them with 2-3 days they expire. This forces an avid reader to purchase more credits. Don't blink - every chapter score cost s $65
Hi.! All your story is nice but very expensive.please put ads to every chapter of the story because other people cant afford to buy coins because not all your readers have a lot of money like me.I want to read but so very expensive for me..thank you.
"Love this app and it sister all Webfic but, it has gotten to expensive. No matter what book I read the app wants to charge me 22 cions pure a chapter wether you buy a single or in bulk. I'm leaving in 3 days if changes is not made. I really do spend money on these two apps."
I hate how long it takes to read if you don't pay for coins. Even the book that's said was free wasn't. I paid 10 dollars for a book and still don't have the whole thing. I'm going to probably delete the app. If I am going to pay that much for a book I will buy from a reputable author.
"I love the reading material, but it is a bit expensive, would be good if they had more prizes and bonus's, $8 to read for 30minutes is a bit pricey I have been reading for a few days now unfortunately i have found it extremely expensive which is a shame as the reading material is good, they charge by chapter, so of course the chapters are very short!!!"
"The app was nice at first... but now for some reason, it's getting annoying. It's logging, forcefully going back to home and I watched an ad but wasn't rewarded . I thought it was weird, so I checked if it needed an update , it did and I updated it but...... It's still going at it.. I don't know anymore .. It's annoying! K"
"Good captivating stories put in simple language. But read a story where you would find a missing word which I felt was not intentional but lack of editing. As well, cost exorbitant and exploitative that makes me not rank app well. Bought coins worth Kenya Shillings 4,900 (about USD $42) for just 359 chapters- about 600 pages. 4,900 in just one day! More expensive than hard copies!!! Kindly price for full book or set of chapters or pages. Feel like UNINSTALLING the App."
"Overall works smooth and nice, but i have issues with linking another device. Under three dots of ""More options"" there's no option to choose that would stay for ""Linked devices"". This error isn't described in the Help Center or on other websites I looked through to find a solution. Therefore I find this experience frustrating. Help will be appreciated. Thanks"
"I spend literally hours trying to get incoming call notifications from whatsapp on lock screen and my TicWatch. I miss most WB calls due to phone or watch not ringing, just sends a missed call message after, too little too late. That area really needs work. 2 stars as it is good for messaging and groups. Call support is flaky at least, but quality is ok."
"The app is good,but the developers need to fix backup problem (if you try backup excluding videos and audio,it doesn't work, rather it requires maximum data as including videos and audios). Please this should be fixed, because I lose my important data due to this problem."
"I changed from an iPhone to Samsung & was told by what's app that if I use the switch app I won't loose anything, I absolutely did! All of my chat history which is very important when you have outstanding orders and past orders on there. The other massive difference is the inbox label display, in android they are a colour flag at the side of a name and if there is more than one label it stacks them so you can't see them. on iPhone it has a colour band under the name with the label info displayed"
"My experience with WB has not been good, It keeps stopping or saying error. It takes time to upload a status and what's even more annoying is the fact that status uploaded by my contacts when i'm offline, i can't see them when i'm back online and it's the same thing with mine as well. Those who are not online when i updated my status can't see them. This is really annoying because i'm a business owner and my views has drastically reduced. Please remove this feature as it isn't helping me at all"
"BOOST STATUS: Please, remove this tool from accounts that are not interested in this kind of service. I don't have a FB account nor an Instagram, therefore I'm not at all interested in advertise my WhatsApp Business in those platforms, however, there's no choice to click on ""not interested"". It is like a visual pollution in my Status area and posts everytime I see the ""boost"" option. Kind regards."
"The features are best, no doubts but somthing is wrong with the app , it stopped working twice and I lost all my chat history and all the media thrice... The app doesn't open or work properly. Please look into the problem. I am facing lots of problems because of this. Please clear the bugs ..."
"I'll give 2 stars Why does the voicenote pause once u switch to a other app and sometimes, it keeps playing? Sounds like a bug... In the notification bar, where voicenote playing info is shown, user should be able to click and it opens up WhatsApp but that's also not working. Why are media files on WhatsApp not being stored on the server like telegram? The moment I swith devices, some media files are lost. Pls fix. Meta is a rich company so can afford to do that. Tx."
"The app keeps giving this ""Chat history error"" that makes recent messages that haven't been backup, disappeared and get lost. So I never get to read such messages. This keeps happening again and again. It's so annoying."
I can send texts but I can't upload status ot delete them without waiting more than 3 hours!! I have a strong data connection but this one problem keeps pissing me off and it's affecting my business terribly. Same thing with the WhatsApp application. 💔
The app is accessing the microphone even when not used for callings and recordings. It Doesn't feel justified for anything reasonable. Microphone should only be accessed while permitted by the user.
I don't like this split screen layout. Pls restore back to full screen or at least have an options to choose. And also pls add privacy control in group chat or group call some times we really do not wants diffrent parties to be able to see each others contact . The host should be able to control that. Else the business makes no sense.
"The name tagging function seems to have a bug, when I type @ it tags for few secs and became ""untagged"", ie normal text before I even get to send the msg. As a result, everyone in the chatgroup sees the name I saved as contact instead of the WA name"
The app works but there are many problems. For example the labelling of chats is completely counterintuitive and you won't even recognise the colour unless you pay attention.
"PLEASE, HOW MANY TIMES I SHOULD REDO MY COLLECTION 😪 I do business, and the catalog really help me. But sometimes, the collection is missing , idk what the problem is. Then, when I need to to order the item in the collection, it always error and cannot be save. Please fix it. Thank you."
"Please cancel the split screen feature it's annoying , awkward and confusing please ... It's been more difficult using it after updating ig ... Kindly solve this issue immediately!!!"
"The Initial White splash screen is terrible. Specially when using dark mode on the phone, at night, in a dark environment."
"Too many problems with this sometimes this block your account without giving any alert message, and sometimes I am unable to save no directly from WhatsApp it saved in contact but not shown in WhatsApp. I need personal chats and group chat is separately."
"It's a nice app, but I don't know what is wrong with my WhatsApp Business.Since some couple of days now it stopped updating,and I can't send messages,I can't receive messages and I can't view my status anymore.please do something by updating it, thanks"
"For a while now I can neither post nor send videos both on whatsapp messanger and Business at first I thought it was network problem, I updated my WhatsApp but up till now nothing has changed 😩 while viewing ppls status it sometimes become blurry and it is really really frustrating. I don't know if the problem is from you guys or my phone But please I need help Abeg🤲😩"
"Over all everything is good , but now there is bug , as i am not able to share multiple documents files. All i need to do is that need to share documents files one by one. So pls fix this issue ASAP."
"So far there has not been any problem but recently, the video call and audio call quality has reduced drastically and I don't hear what the person says most times, it is not clear"
"audio and video call not working on my whtsapp and whtsapp business, continuously showing connecting, even all the permissions have been allowed and connected to fast wifi network."
Whatsapp business keeps crashing and I can't even open it to at least back up everything. One if not THE worst updates since Meta (Facebook) bought the app. Regreting setting up my business on WhatsApp.
"I give it two stars because of the disappearing message features it has. To me it's not nice cos it's a business whatsapp and should not delete any message. I'd you want your messages to be deleted,download the other Whatsapp"
After the last update i have some issues😔After i selected some photos to send a documents and click send button then only one document is being send😒😰 But i loved so much whatsapp so please solved this problem quickly🙏
The input bar when using Whatsapp Business on Samsung Dex is cut off in the latest verson which means that you cannot see the message you are typing.
Doesn't have option to chat with recent Call person (phone normal call) have to use another app for adding recent call person for chat. Also payment option not found (if order confirmation) have to use another app to take payment
"Dear WhatApp, why after I update it I cant send the multiple documents ? Can you fix that ? Cause its wasting time if I have to send the document one by one."
Hey Whatsapp Team ! I am not able to send multiple documents at one time so please look into this matter and fix as soon as possible. Please
The new interface is soo horrible I don't want that thing in my app I can't swipe to msg i can't chat properly why?? You changed and still you changed the interface atleast give option to us to customise as per our need not yours pls look into this.
Migration from IPhone to Android and vice versa needs special attention. As both types of devices have become way of life. Other platform supports such migration. Perhaps whatsapp can support their inhouse cloud backup to facility the service which will also help in generating revenue.
Well thanks you for bringing up this app but woah it's a bit confusing some apps aren't working after downloaded wc makes me loose sme interest in it. But it's a bit helpful though Thanks you for that
"I am facing issue that i cannot connect my whatsapp business to my laptop. Whenever i tap on link a device option it ask me to use mobile data or wifi, after tapping on use mobile data option it ask me to enter password of my mobile and after entering password it brings me back to link a device screen rather asking me to scan qr code to connect to pc."
"hmmmmmmmm, some thing pissed me off today, this thing of disappearing massages, I did not activate t, but wen I updated the app, it went on automatically, I have lost some important documents from several people, how I wish this is not automatic and it applies to only selected contacts"
Mic is always in use even though you are not using app. Always running in background with mic. Is it suspicious right.
My whatsapp business view on tablet is changing into split view and I don't really like it since I usually use my tablet in portrait mode. And this is not so big tablet (just 10 inches). Is there any setting or another way to make it back to original view? Helppp 😭😭😭
Even though the app is good overall. They did me bad personally. I tried to add just 13 friends from my contact list to my group and they banned my account.
"Can't open any link from within a message with this upgrade. It wasn't so before. Its giving an error message ""you may not have a proper app for viewing this content"" Kindly fix this"
"Good app indeed however, when wanting to forward something it can take about 10+ minutes to load contacts to forward to. This is time wasting"
Status are now being seen only by people who are online when you post it and it wasn't like that before. A whole of people are complaining it. A whole lot of job opportunities were lost due to this bad status viewing problem. Looking forward to a change in it back to how it was before
This patch update is pushed many times. User is confused whether to go for update each time or once. No clarity from developer side.
The app itself is very easy to work with and I really like advertising on it. The one thing that has me to a point of cancelling is that it keeps on cancelling your catalogues that you have spend hours on creating and sorting your products out into them. This is very frustrating and irritating . People want products grouped to look at but it seems that the business app does not cater for that and to spend that amount of time every few weeks to redo isjust not .
"Boring! Notification failure, voice and video call can't connect kindly solve this problem soon as possible thanks"
"Stops working during video call, only my video hangs opposite end can see the video clearly but for me it is stuck. The video of opposite end works fine and then all controls stops working. I cant disconnect after it hangs. My phone doesnt hang at all. Using Vivo y73 with 8gb ram it never hangs. I also noticed when i move my video window to the top of screen it starts after that . One more thing why the my video window opens at the bottom of screen it makes me look like eyes closed and talking."
Watsapp business does not allow directly message by searching using only number but instead I have to put that number in contact first then message the person Its annoying because it takes 5 min to just send a small information which could be done by sending by typing number in search box Now my contact is filled with people I don't even know
"This is very annoying.. After updating the App you can't message more than 20 people on WhatsApp group, it showing red dot whyyy It have started again this is very annoying please do something"
"The app has been good for quite some time now but you're taking slow to introduce new features like themes, separating groups and personal chats, more privacy settings are needed on the app. WeChat has more features than WhatsApp official apps why?"
I'm having an issue with getting calls to register the app for a landline. I deleted the account from my old phone and tried to install it on a new one but I'm not getting a call to register it. I've tried several times! The call either doesn't go through or it shows and gives me a notification about it or nothing happens at all without any notification. Is there a way to receive the code by email? I'm worried that i may have lost the account & won't be able to get it work again in both phones
"The updated one is good, but I don't know why it can't allow us to send a document file more than 1. When u mark all to send it keep bringing one item to send and it's so frustrating"
When I video call and then open gallery. My camera goes off and then I cannot turn it in until I cut the call. What is wrong?
It's not getting started since today morning. Even not able to send feedback. Kindly fix this bug
When i scroll down through contacts to send the same message to a certain contact dooown there it takes too long cause the scrolling tool is too small 🥶 plz make it bigger
"Collections deleting itself randomly. I reorganized my collections like 7 times. Please just fix this December 5: My collections are suddenly deleting itself. I re-edited it dozens of times, but several minutes ago I just looked it and it was deleted again. Recently I reported it. But nothing changed, it still happening. I can't reorganize it everyday😕 December 6: My collections deleted again February 15: still happens"
Anytime someone sends me a voice note video or picture I can't download it It take two days just to download and same thing when I'm sending them too
"(in low internet signal)Out of the four parts of WhatsApp voice status, the middle part is not getting sent,And the setting doesn't sand, which is the problem. & in picture background my voice (please add function)."
"I like every features in dx WhatsApp to d very new WhatsApp audio status but what I don't like now is, me updating my status n those who aren't online won't view bcux they were offline. Plz I don't like it, especially as a business woma. I'll post a particular product n only 10 persons who are online,, can only view cuz 50k contacts are offline. Plz I don't like dx one thank u. It's better u Take back d audio n allow everyone have access to view my status whenever they're online. Thank u"
"Message from other side doesn't get delivered to me unless I open the app. In addition, same is the case with the Notification of this application, isn't working. Kindly resolve."
Notifications don't work. No sound or vibration. It just shows a notification icon in the notification shade.
"Allow group owners control. Provide an option to delete messages from spammers in group. I am happy to see that my earlier concerns have been addressed. Next, Can we now have the option to record our video/audio calls?"
Recently i had to re login into my account however the verification code can not be sent to my phone number nor the verfication code via phone call is not recievable. Please enable email verification specially for iran bcs there are restrictions over the apps from the gov . Side.
This app is good but some time it's doesn't work properly such that not any single status are shown or msg are not send and receive i requested to you please little bit faster check mine problem and correct it 🙏🙏
"While forwarding any message, photo Or searching for any contact it gets buffering every time. Which is very irritating. Please help me."
"When you upload a clear video or pictures on status, they are blurry, not clear. Please fix that problem."
"My whatsapp isnt opening at all and keep saying something went wrong with my chat history and its so frustrating and sh** like whatsapp business error, try and fix dis please, coz i have no acess to my whatsapp right now, thats why im giving you just 2 stars, fix this asap plz"
WhatsApp business must have folder creation option. The chats are to be allowed to move to required folder. This will help a lot for users.
"Every month when I turn on WhatsApp, I get the error of restore data and all the data is lost and I keep the daily backup option on, but the backup is not done."
"I Like the App however when changing phones - The backup fails to download - blaming the net work. Normal whatsapp was quick, so I am not understanding the complication. Noone from Whatsapp can give a solution. I have tried encrypted and nonencrypted backup. the error is the same."
"I can't send or receive voice note, I can't view status and upload any since I upgraded."
Unable to send google drive document files or imagea to two or multple peoples at same time when we try to send it fails .. Serious issue. Fux this bug
Bugs during video call....video pause automatically Unable to select documents files and send...so many bugs
"Can't send multiple files in document form, Unless singles. This app is growing down."
"The latest update is very terrible because voice notes no longer play automatically like they used to, now we have to select each one manually which is time consuming where else previously it was playing automatically even if the phone is locked. Please rectify this for a better experience of the app"
Absolutely brilliant until recently. I no longer get popup notifications when people call or text. Blaming isot on Android version isn't an excuse. You guys are supposed to be programming experts so PLEASE FIX IT. This is so important to my business that I'm considering using one of the other products out ther e.g. Teams or SLACK.
"Since about last 1 month my WhatsApp Business calling is a one way voice transmitter . About 2 -3 minutes after call connection , the other side can't hear me , but I can hear them very clearly . I have to hang up and redial to speak to them . But that one sided voice call continues on every call after about 2-3 minutes of connection . not any internet issue , as I have tested and ruled out network issue's doubt .plz fix it."
"Whenever I tried to upload a photo or video, the picture quality is reduced and it is diminished causing this blurry effect. I scouted the settings and turn on best-quality uploads but it didn't fix the problem. I tried uploading the same picture to other media and it retained its quality please help fix this bug."
For years there's been this persistent issue. WhatsApp Voice recordings are HORRIBLE. Plain horrid! You literally CANNOT hear voice recordings. Your screen goes dark and you can't hear a recording. Why can't the developers fix this issue?
"Been having a lot of hard time with this app lately. It rarely opens on my phone and when it does it automatically logs me out. Not been a good experience so far & frustrating, have tried uninstalling & reinstalling severally but the problem keep occuring."
Why does it takes too long to upload the catalogue??? Fix this prblm as soon as possible... It's total lame thing..work on it. I'm hating this everytime!!!!
"The latest version of WhatsApp business has some but of hiccup... Videos are not loading like it would in previous versions, it is annoying and I have not been able to make any video posts... This update is messed up, fix it abeg, today is Christmas and I have lots of videos to post to the world🎊🎉"
The app is top notch but again and again I receive notifications that ur account is Ban and automatically it's start working.... But now it's not working... Can u please check it once
App keeps crashing almost everytime. I had to install and reinstall. 💱 I'm tired 😩😩 of Whatsapp.
Business whats app is not supported in true caller. Regular whatsapp is accessed on true caller without saving number. But business whats app is not accessible on true caller without saving number
"One day just turn to this split-view feature don't know why, it split into two small chat view, how to fix? Is it because I use a tablet?"
"Atleast provide a high quality image, vidoe transfer with a hq and sd button document transfer in whatsapp. Send as a document is time consuming and not everyone is techy to send it via this method"
"Notifications and calls are not working, even though battery optimisation and all permissions are given."
This app is good but now a days I m facing an issue..I didn't get notifications of this app.plzzresolve it's issue.. Dear whatsapp honour..I m facing this issue. I don't receive notification.plzz solve my issue
There should be feature of search by name option even in status seen list. Kindly provide update for the same.
"When I,am sending video on my status then the quality of status are soo blury and lag. So I requested to solve this problem 😔"
WhatsApp don't consider those with lots of contacts when updating their apps.... I have 16k+ contacts... Now it takes 2 hours for one status to upload 🤧... My WhatsApp keeps stopping. I have to keep re-opening it again and again. This is bad. Please help us resolve this issue
"Why can't I select pictures from gallery and broadcast it together? Very annoying when you have to choose one picture at a time and keep sending it. Also the broadcast group does not show in the web version, this is more annoying. 😒"
Voice issue is very swear the other person on call would not be able to here your voice very disappointed. Even we cannot share any file please resolve issues
"I just recently wanted to create my business catalogue on Whatsapp. But for 2 weeks now I keep getting the same error message. ""Your catalogue has not been created try again later"" and this has been affecting my business performance. I thought the newer updates rolled out would fix the issue, but nothing yet."
"sorry for 2 star ,I will fix it when you read my comment...app does not work in Iran becouse of our goverment policy (filtering), pleaseas telegram did, interduce a way for us to access our lovely whatsapp again 😭 (we iranians love this app and we cant receive recognising code anymore😢😢)"
"Good day I uninstalled the Whatsapp business on my phone, since then it has not been upload again. When I open the App ist closes by itself, if I try to reopen it the same thing keeps happened. What can I do to make it work properly again? I uninstalled it and download it again the same thing happened"
"I notice I don't see people who viewed my status when I was offline, I come online and I don't see the people who viewed my status. Please change this feature, thank you so much."
After update the app WhatsApp buisness in my mobile the stickers are not working and also few months ago suddenly I opened and saw my all stickers were delete automatically I don't know what happened
"If am playing a voice note my phone screen will off and if it on , I won't hear anything I don't like this.... It makes me regret of updating my WhatsApp, you guys should fix this for me please"
It doesn't always notify you've got new messages. Makes us lose business.
"It's a very good app, it's just that they keep banning my line for no reason and it won't load my pictures and videos for me to post on my status"
"*update* When you use the hidden folder, it saves to the internal memory without choice. Then changes the thumbnail, which for some reason makes the files unplayable when transferring them to a source outside of the mobile device, like a thumb drive.* Easy to use. I took 3 stars away until the option to use SD card to save to is implemented. Once that is done, I will rate it 5 stars. Until then I cannot use the app because it takes all the internal space I have on my phone, and I paid for it."
Plays many different formats. Awesome feature is you can have it play in the background (great for listening to lectures). Unfortunately it often loses your place when you go back to restart a video. It is very annoying when it goes all the way to the beginning. I wish there were a way to bookmark to save our spot on the video to avoid losing our place. Also does not stop when a call comes in - not good.
"Update: I got a reply from XPlayer. I purchased the app. The ""history"" issue is still not fixed! I wouldn't have paid for it if I knew. I play Episode 1 of a serial, and then I turned the phone off. Next time I turn the phone and XPlayer on. Then Episode 1 is go to finish, and I click ""Next Video"" button, and it says ""No Next Video""!!! I paid only to get rid of the ads. By the way, the ""Show History"" is on. ------------- Old comment: It seemed good in the beginning. But it has some serious problems. 1. It cannot remember where you played last time. For example, you have a serial that has 30 episodes. One day you are watching Episode 5. Next day you turn XPlayer back on. And it might play Episode 2. If you don't memorize it yourself, you might never know where you were last time. 2. Tons of annoying ads. a. Every time you pause a video, an ad will pop up. b. Since it cannot remember where you were last time, you want to go back to folders so next time you click the video that shows on the folder area. That would be the video you watched last time. But when you go back to folders, there will always be a pop-up ad. That's why I uninstalled XPlayer, and have started to use the KMPlayer. I've used the KMPlayer on my laptops for about 20 years. It's the best in the world. But I didn't think about it for my android phone until I couldn't stand XPlayer anymore. After I've used the android version of KMPlayer, I've decided like it -- it has no ads. I'll keep using."
Initially really enjoyed app and paid for HD version but music videos no longer play! When I tap on a video I'm reverted back to homepage. I've uninstalled several times and each time videos play in the beginning but after a couple of days it stops working. I am disappointed 04 Dec 2018. Recommend fix does not address the problem. Will only play video's intermittently
"Some videos I play have multiple language tracks. If the language you prefer is not the default (listed first), once you change your selection and the video starts to play it's fine, but if you try to chromecast or jump to another app and come back it automatically changes back to the default setting (wrong language). And you cant change audio once its chrome casting."
"This app use to be a good one but now the ads are getting super annoying. And its got 2 aggitating problems. Heres one issue: I get into the app and go to my Videos and pick one off my list to watch, after I watch it and I exit the video it takes me back to the home screen, instead of going back to the list of Videos, then between doing all of this 4 ads interrupted me. The 2nd issue I have is: I can tolerate some ads but too many gets annoying real fast so I am done with this app for awhile."
Edit2: Bought premium. The previous orientation issue still exists. What I mean by remembering orientation is not just landscape but also reverse landscape. VLC has this option of 'reverse landscape'. Keeps forgetting the particular landscape orientation I have locked it to. Have to 'remind' it and turn the phone EVERYTIME. Could you please fix this?
Sometimes I can't play RARBG format videos and when I try to play it the sound of the video often gets faster than the actual video. Other than that this is a fantastic app. Please try to fix it.
Cant zoom in & the ads are way too many & in the way. I do like that it converts audio files though I haven't tried it.
Good video player but I have one doubt I enable the subtitle customisation mode it shows display issues some cases. The issues is a video display or phone display please clarify my dout
"The app keeps on tell no network connection while I'm downloading videos and it only downloads 3 videos at go too slow , please someone fix that and increase the number to maybe a 6"
"I cant figure out how to make it stop resuming vidros when i return to them. I want the player to always play from the begging, on every video, every yime."
"My only complaint about this app is that the subtitles are weird. I can't properly enjoy my movies when the subtitles doesn't align with the movies displaying on my screen, please fix it.."
Pls Urgently change the 2x speed playing position . I Read subtitles only the top of the screen so it's annoying.
copy video from one folder to another. this functionality are missing.
"Lacks customization. You guys might wanna see how MX Player can be customized. But i must commend you for having better audio output quality. Also, the pop-up window can only be dragged around on the bottom half of the screen, why's that? Second, it should be freely resizeable; zooming/panning the video should not re-center automatically; the 'Play from Last position' button is so intrusive too."
Firstly the app is user friendly but my concern is ...when m playing mkv anime series it left the voice behind while the action is still continuing...plz fix that
"Played VOB files once and would not reconize them after. Another point to be noted, there is not a widget for this app. This is odd given how long the app has been out. ."
"Still not working, need help to fix! I used to love this app on my Galaxy S8, now on my Xperia 1 I am having issues. It used to be able to automatically detect my .MTS files but now I have to manually browse through my files to be able to play my videos. It's very frustrating and annoying to not see the files in Xplayer. I'll gladly give you the highest rating if you help me with this issue. I've tried to contact your support by email but I have not received any response from you. Please help!"
I have no option but to delete this app until you get the no dialogue issues sorted
"When i play music it plays two songs at a time, Jumping from one song to another"
"Decent media player but it doesn't let you browse music files using the folder structure you actually have on your file system. Also seems to use a lot of battery, even just for playing audio. (12/23) Update in response to developer's query: Even Android itself reports that this app uses excessive CPU and needs to be shut down. Just now I got a message saying it was using 12% of CPU with no media playing! Why would I close apps that work fine to absorb the impact of yours that doesn't? FIX IT!!"
Why there is a limit of 60 minutes on sleep timer? I should be able to set any value as how many minutes i want. It's pretty annoying. Also provide an option to import export database in case someone wants to switch phones. Moreover why can't i boost audio files to 200% just as the video files 😠Will consider improving the rating once the aforesaid issues are resolved.
Play button is not user friendly. When I press it. It works after 3-5 seconds. Please improve it. Thank You.
2 problems with this app that made me switch back to MX: (1) it couldn't properly playback some videos (which I had feedback to the developer); (2) the playback quality of a video taken with my N10 appeared washout which I wasn't aware until I accidentally played it on other media players. Reply to developer: I managed to playback the 'corrupted' video using at least 3 other media players.
"I was using MXplayer, but it's far better than that. User-friendly, low size, play MP3 and video. But I'm giving 3 stars cuz, everytime i play music, music library loads slow and sometimes it stopped without a reason. Please fix those bugs, otherwise the perfect player I ever found in Play Store. Thank you devloers.."
For the most part the app worked as promised. My biggest grip was the tiny add boxes that would pop up right over a video and stay there until you checked the little X to close it. Really? thats how you choose to display an ad?
"The video suffle button is on automatically and it's freeze on I can't off it, pls fix this big it's really annoying when we jump from a certain video to like 8× times ahead of it's next video ( web series ) and also pls do something about the Ui like make animation more smooth I can't see any smoothness when I touch something"
"Tons of pop up ads. I like the zoom feature, it's a little blurry but allows you to zoom in on a portion of the video. But anytime you pause, zoom, pan, or do ANYTHING on a video, you get a pop up ads. This makes it difficult to use. I understand the need for ads, but this is hindering the usability and performance of the app."
"Have to enable background play for each video. Keeps forgetting speed preset, played time. Automatically creates playlist and switches to next video, ignoring the setting. Ignores timer. As a result, instead of playing for 15 minutes, it played for hours, draining my headphones over night. Happened multiple times. Why have settings if they don't work?"
"This used to be the best app for all the media consumption but after the recent update something is broken. Though it plays an kind of video format, fails to play them for not more than 10 minutes straight. After 10 mins the video will stop for a second and continue after going back few frames. This simply kills all the fun. This happened when I was using SW decoder. I also tried with HW decoder, that was floccinaucinihilipilification😂. Fix this and you'll get 5 stars😉. Cause this is the best apps still with all the bugs"
"The app is great, been using it for years now but I prefer the first version that locks the videos because this on have many disappointing letdowns like i can't lock videos on my SD card it just copy them to the phone storage then lock them, which makes me very angry. And the subtitles doesn't wanna download and when I download them outside the app they don't work..fix this you're massing up an awesome app, and oh, please stop the pop-up ads cz they suck"
"One thing that frustrates me is, whenever I try to pause a video by double tapping the screen, it skipps forward. It wants me to precisely tap at middle of the screen that almost costs the double tap to pause feature. Please make double tap to skipp as an option and I would always have it disabled."
I have issues regarding secure folder. When I add new videos to folder my old videos get disappear and in place of those new video is shown many times. Help to get 5 star.
"It's a good app but it can't download subtitles anymore in any of my devices (it says ""service unavailable""). It's a pity, as I downloaded it for the convenience it offered downloading subtitles of any language easy and fast, a feature that made it better than other players. Please fix it"
"This app is so good but some ways it's so annoying because whenever i played 2hours video sometimes it can't fast forward, i clicked 2x at the right side but it doesn't work and nothing happens when i clicked 2x or fastforward, it will work if i fast forward it in 1minute. pls fix! hope you will response."
My review would have been 5 stars. I've been using this app for months with no problems. Even paid for the full version. But now it will not load my files randomly. It's just stuck forever loading. Reinstalling doesn't help. I'm really disappointed that this app has stopped working.
"I hate advertisement in online streaming apps and this app gives advertisement being a offline video app. What a joke. Advertisement not only appears while using app, but also appears when you are watching a video in Full screen. I know we can disable internet to prevent advertisement and watch videos, but at times we need internet to be turn on in the background for some important work."
"On one side, it works properly for most of the time..but, well, I dunno why it can't read .sub files and I have to search for .srt files instead. That would almost not be a problem as I use another additional player, but the ads here can be horrific, (slightly) stupified and amazingly naggy. Really, I am on the edge of uninstalling this. Did some job, but really pissed me off and I will keep it without updates. I damn prefer my PC's kmPlayer..."
"The best video player I've ever seen. However there are some things you have to fix in the app for playing *audios*: 1- speed control while playing 2- double-tap function which +10s & -10s 3- Play from where I stopped last time (this is available in videos. I also want it in audios, too). Thanks for your attention"
"the app cant search subtitles when repeatedly searched in the same video it is playing. Says stuffs like can't find at the moment or something. other than that its a wonderful app. love it pls also when using night mode MAKE the subtitles also in night mode it hurts the eyes. the brightness of the subtitles seems constant , night mode does nothing to it. cheers"
"Has too many ads: ads in lists, ads in full screen out of nowhere, ads in animated button of ice cream, ads when pausing videos. I never saw so many ads in so many places. And it can't show puncutations signs well for Hebrew (can put ""."" in the beginning of a sentence, for example). The subtitles also get overlaps with the playback buttons, which is annoying. At least has option to download subtitles"
"Recently I've brought the premium package, Honestly The app is good if you use as free app. But if you brought premium you won't get nothing but remove ads only. And the price doesn't worth it. There is no special theme or customizable option for premium user. Also doesn't have as much customizable option compared to MX Player Pro. Hey Developer, you should focus on premium theme and more customizable option for UI."
"Video quality doesn't go past 720p. Watching some videos from my drone, resulted in strange artifacts showing up on screen; tears and color spikes. Also when zooming in, the quality was very distorted in comparison to the stock video player on my phone, which was MUCH more clear. Uninstalling."
"found it jumpy on chromebook with sound lagging pictures This wasn't a network issue because I was playing a mkv movie of 7 gb from a usb flash drive (64gb sandisk ultra) Furthermore I was trying different players to see which was for an acer chromebook 11, None of them properly play and some don't play at all. I download these and if they don't work I uninstall, The best one so far is the vlc which plays the movie ok without stuttering or sound lag. But that isn't perfect either because it's such a faff to find the video files. But it does play and smoothly. HD video player offered here has been uninstalled."
"Have been using this app for a while it has been good until a week or so ago, it has now started cutting videos off before they finish and skipping to the next one which is become very annoying, also the time counter on the play bar shows a shorter time than the video is and +time e.g. 10:20+02:10, i cant find anything in the settings to stop this. A shame as until this it was exactly what i was looking for."
I'm using this for last 2 years and it was exceptionally well. I have premium account but from last couple of weeks Video audio synch is not proper and also when I'm adding new videos In my device it's not showing here. Don't know what happened.
"My videos are unable not play in this app. I don't know why but before starting the video it is saying to stop other videos which are currently playing. But I checked twice and no other videos were playing, even if cleared all currently running apps in the background, But idle is not working. I am seriously fed up. May you please tell what I can do for this"
"Not better than mx player or vlc, it even doesn't remember Audio track of a video. Every time it plays same video with first track from the list of a multi track movie. its a basic feature. One more thing lots of intrusive ads in list view of videos from my device."
"Average player, needs a perm. Notification on the pull downtown screen.... What i mean it's one you start your music playing { And you leave the player app and go to other apps for some reason once the 1st song is through, the player cuts off instead of going to next song and so on"
"This was one of the best players. However now when I play a video from a folder or locked folder the app crashes. I think maybe too many videos are in the folder. Please fix this, it'd be much appreciated."
"This used to be a great video player/editor until a week ago. Now, ads pop up literally every 3 seconds while a video is playing making it impossible to watch anything or edit videos. I was going to get the premium addition but have changed my mind."
"Will play individual trail cam videos but I have to restart each one, then open each one with this app. Far too much trouble just to look at a 30 second video. Pixel 2 XL on 9.0 REPLY TO DEV: There isn't an option in the Play Mode to include an OTG USB memory card."
"It doesn't animate it's thumbnails, which makes you wonder if they've ever used the program they're selling. If you don't know the name it downloaded under and it starts with the usual black screen, tough. It's just one of the other hundred black screens to start clicking on."
Think I'm gonna have to shop around for a new one...ads every pause and pop at the top moving the playlist down. Not a good experience to make me want to pay for ad free. Otherwise the app operates well. Good organization.
"File WEBM format. Path is downloads folder. I should always browse the file from FILE EXPLORER app then chose to play it. Seems hectic, can u pls fix the bug pls(Unable to detect and show videos with WEBM format!! Disappointed... Else its a Ultimate replacement for MX player... Loved it more then other video players)"
"I like your player a lot. It does exactly what I need in a video player and the UI is nice. I highly recommend it to all who want simple simplicity, but the ads made me change my mind. I started getting ads like crazy. I don't care what the reason is, you should never be allowed to advertise unless given permission to."
"Always loved the app, but lately its giving issues, cant refresh instead i have to close the app, and sometimes even closing the app still i cant view my video files. Some cases, the subtitle feature just replies service unavailable. Please let this app move back to its former glory, not just go down the drain🙌🏾"
ive been using you guys for almost half a year and i love the player. however im not sure when but recently for me advertisments that are game demos play in the background of what im watching. the advertisement causes frame drops and play various pinging noises while i am watching something.
This app is great it got almost every settings i needed for watching a video but the porblem is that whenever i watch video and im in the middle or almost ending part of the video it just stop the video and forcely quit and there some option there says feedback or help i did the help thing and it doesn't work its irritating that every time im in the good part it just keep quiting. It happen everytime so im deleting this if this keep continued so pls fix fast
Disruptive video ads make this app a no-go for me. They really use every single ad trick in the book. Even when you re-open the app the last video ad will start playing again. Because of that this app uses internet in the background. Uninstalled this app after one day of use!
"Why are you copying Youtube 'move 10 seconds' backward & forward feature by double taping? It's unnecessary when it's already can be done by just sliding on it. Before this, I can pause/unpause with double taping. Beside abundant ads messing up my watching, that just absurd."
"Don't know how this got rated highly; despite what it says, it can only play mp3 files. It couldn't even find my many .wma files, which is what I need. There was nothing in settings to set the type of files to search for and include, and like I said, could not find thousands of songs on my SD card."
Struggles playing videos that my main video player can play. Navigation and creating playlists are challenging. No chapter support. Ads block you from being able to use the app while they're playing. I do like the subtitle customization features.
"Not bad. Some features are frustrating, like the subtitles coming on automatically and having to turn it off for every single video. But the codec and video rendering is excellent"
Unable to accurately pause and scroll videos site Every video starts at 25 seconds even though it is actually starting at 0 then plays past the 30 seconds showing for the videos time so you don't actually know how long the videos is and cannot slow frame near the end to get screen captures. Plays AVIs is about the only feature that worked except as noted above.
"Drains mobile data with ads. Especially on older Android phones (8.0 and older). We would have continued to support the developer if they used a ""donation based"" ""free to use"" concept.. But trying to force your supporters to pay to remove ads when you have a much larger competitor (VLC) offering the same features, and more, for free - is not very smart to me. Note to the developer: If you decide to make your app free to use, we would be glad to support you with a donation."
"This app deleted entire folders of music from my SD card, then picked & chose songs to delete from my playlists. It shuffles songs, even though shuffle is off. Glad I keep a backup of my music on a separate drive. Back to VLC I go.."
I have more than 100 GB of videos and it takes at least 2 minutes to load whereas in MX player it doesn't take almost anything. EDIT : Email sent with video evidence. EDIT (19/7) : No difference found. EDIT (30/7) : No difference again. Time to uninstall. Going back to MX player. EDIT (3/8) : Solution didn't work as expected. Time to move on.
very nice video player but after update download option not appear on the screen i am very disappointed 😞
"VERY CONFUSING to use. This app has 3 names for same app. I installed ""Video Player All Format"" After installation app is called ""Android Video Player"" and also ""XPlayer"". Which name is used depends on how you access the app. Look at my apps list it's called ""XPlayer"". If I use a file manager, and open downloaded video, the player is called called ""Android Video Player"". Otherwise it's a good app. Developer needs to use only ONE name for this app!"
"Seems a nice app but there is a lil bug in it. When plug headphones, the equalizer is messing up with the sound. Kiinda ruined the purpose of using that app for music... Might need an update, prolly my phone is to new. (Huawei Y9 pro)"
Over heat and drain battery please solve it😭😭😭😭😭
The best for video subtitle
"Totally unacceptable ad policy on the free version - every time, all the time there's an add in the middle of the screen on paused video. It's hard to attract customers this way."
I had used this app in the past for obscure video files but the newer layout makes it an aggravating wrestling match to have video footage play properly from the phone camera. I don't see a need for this app.
"Only Portrait mode works fine in my android tablet, in landscape mode the videos never match the tablet screen aspect ratio and starts playing in the middle of the screen with arrows to pull it to the left or right side."
Confusing to use. Ads look like your own movie files and ads pop up before and after playing. Other than that it does play your files if you can find them. Better alternatives on the app store like mx player
There's a problem with subtitles background where I can't choose different background color than the subtitles it self. So the subtitles are not appearing. Since both have the same colors.
"There is a problem with the video and audio sync somehow. I've checked all the settings, even restart to default mode and still not working. Not sure what happened."
New review : Major bug fixes are required thumnail of previously deleted videos get stuck on new ones... New video don't show new it's showing viewed... Fixing in sorting algorithm is must not reading upper case lower case and numeric names as different. Old review ; Some videos downloaded from torrent are not read or displayed.... Minor bug fix is needed
"Worked wonderfully at first. But after some time, be prepared for the thing to freeze and quit frequently when casting to Chromecast. Disappointed. I just want a reliable media player."
"Not working, doesn't display all the videos files that were renamed recently. Video is great but it's a bit issue if I have to manually look for than instead of just refreshing page. Please fix"
not bad but needs to allow Media buttons to be always visible as well as set their color and transparency level. it's annoying to try to play and pause in the right places
"I can't play a particular group of videos with this player. It does not play all format videos afterall. It did not meet my expectations at all. It's not too bad though, it has its own good features"
"1. AVI video codec not supported in Xplayer. All other players supported this codec. AV1 codec video is showing in black. 2. Playback of VP8 and VP9 codec videos are very laggy in Xplayer. But my phone itself play these codec videos smoothly. All other video players can play these codec videos even in HW decoder. 3. There is no improvements while changing to HW decoder to SW decoder. 4. 4K video -webM playback is not smooth, but the 4K videos -webM plays smoothly in system video player."
This app is poorly coded or has background process that kills battery. My battery was quickly drained to 0 even after I closed the app after using it for 30min. The GUI is easy to use. I am forced to un install it due to the battery issue.
"This is a good player but does not remember settings like brightness after closing and opening it again. This causes a lot of discomfort, as everytime I open any video with this player the first thing I am doing is changing brightness."
For some reason downscales hd video until it's really pixelated. So it doesn't work as well as the built in video player. It can play more file types though.
"I think this application is not compatible with Android 10. Now equalizer is not working after update of android 10... After update to android 10 now equalizer is not working, if i turn on or turn off it's the same no any difference."
"Everything is good and the app justifies 4.8 rating. But only problem i face is i can't sync adjust subtitles, and it is a huge problem for me. Please fix it soon then you'll have 5 stars from me."
"this is a great video player but it is indeed lacking of customization like mx player like other people said here like keep the screen turned on & everytime you touch the screen, it will pause the video instead of tapping it twice in the middle just to pause the video. keep the screen turned on & tap anywhere in the video & it will instantly pause the video are just the things you will find in mx player but the problem with mx player rn is it will go backwards a few secs the moment you pause it."
"It's OK, but the casting it's not working. I was trying to cast on tv via chromecast, the tab for cast appears, but no connection. Can you look into this? Regards,Ovidiu"
"Garbage. Your App is also beautiful & easy to use and no hang problem but, when i clicks on dark theme option add starts playing. After finishing the add, play store opens without clicking & app crashes. When i reclicks on dark or other theme add plays and this app crashes. [About phone- Micromax P480, android 4.4.2, RAM- 1GB] Hope you will reply soon or help me..."
I give it a 2 cause theres a problem with videos that i tested. once you made a video private with xplayer and tried using that video somewhere else you can't undo it which made the video unplayable anymore. unless theres a way to undo it i'll give this rating and review a better score
"It doesn't work with Chromecast (crashes)! Email with video properties sent. As soon as the issue has been fixed, you may call me your friend. 😜"
"Missing three major features. Remember the last video played. Remember ui settings like playback speed across instances. Needs a file browser for the entire file system, not just an auto file scanner."
"It automatically stops playing the large audio file mostly. There is no forward or backward option , neither you can increase or decrease the play speed in audio mode."
Everything is fine but i do not see any full list videos at one place.if there is one folder with all videos then it would be perfect music video player.consider if you are listening me.
"it is perfect for open videos and subtitles and play nice and easy even can play jappanese sub but only problem is , only option for subtitles is zoom and don't have any other options for subtitles look like make it slowed or faster and sync option."
"Looks good but geared towards dodgy betting companies who they work with. The BIG CHANCE that flashes up should be removed, or only used if there is a penalty for example. considering 98% of the time BIG CHANCE means an actual goal has been scored, I don't see the point in it being brought in. Would be better if they had kept it as it was. Edit: I watch football and most of the time the goal has already been DEFINITELY scored and your app still shows BIG CHANCE. Delay? I disagree."
Hi! I don't see all the odds for the previous mstches anymore. The only odds are the 1 x 2 odds. I don't know why you took those out. Please bring them back. I would have given a solid 5 if not for that though. The odds for the upcoming matches also don't show. Please fix it
"This is a great app. However, it's let down by the fact that it's not responsive design and text size cannot be changed. This combined with the colours used in dark mode make it very hard to read. Scores a zero for me on accessibility."
The app is too buggy...There should be an Edit option to change the fonts... The fonts are too big for me and i'm already stressed scrolling to find my statistics...
"sometimes you count rubbish when it comes to statistics like throwing or foul and even some times goal attempt .l, please work on it, aside that you're good to go. 🙏 thanks. Now you've finally taken out throwings from statistics why?"
When will you repair 'loading' state each time it is run from the background. It is necessary to force closing and reopen the app. It is like several years already and few phones during that time. I can help you with testing/fixing just let me know this is annoying
"every time I've had the app open in the evening, when i open it the next morning there is an infinite loading spinner because it can't handle the day's changed when resuming the app."
"Always says ""Something went wrong - Requested data could not be loaded"" whenever trying to view a match report."
"This app is fantastic, full of useful information. However, as of it late it keeps freezing and force closing, very frustrating. Currently using a Pixel 7, any fixes would be welcomed."
"This app is becoming more useless with every new update. The app is not updating but rather downgrading. Delayed in notifications, wrong information giving on life matches, wrong giving time for matches, etc. This is so annoying. This app use to be my best of choice ever but now it's the worst."
Very good app. I will like you to improve on player statistics in a match
I just love flashscore but efforts must be made to improve its stability. Also it sometimes takes much time whiles loading data irrespective of how fast the internet connection is.
Bare bones live stats. Won't even show 3 pointers in the NBA whereas the website does. It's more useful to open this in a browser than to download the app.
Love this app but it keeps freezing and force closing on Google Pixel 7. No such problems on my Samsung Tablet - please fix as it's getting annoying - already tried uninstalling and reinstalling ☹️
"I don't know why you haven't updated the viewing player's match stat when thier name is clicked on, in a live game, you're making it hard to follow up on their game play during the match and frustrating me to using other apps Please I'm looking forward to the update, you promised to consider the other time and nothing of such yet😏"
"It's getting worse,third wicket has fallen in the test match and although mentioned in the commentary the score has not been altered. Had l just had a quick glance of the score l would have been missinformed making a mockery of the name flashscore"
The update has multiple connectivity issues. The update was of no use. Takes forever to load
The app is just great and beautifully designed and I could have rated the app all 5 ✨⭐⭐ but I couldn't plz fix the premier league symbol(Lion's head) on premier league section as u have already done on on all some top European football leagues' sections
Please you guys should work on the android version of this app. It takes so much time to load..like so much time and it's so annoying. Please work on this issue because it was better than this before.
"Decent app. But why is the web version more superior in terms of showing stats. Beats the purpose on an app. Do better. We live in the 21st century, no excuses"
"Why does it show just goal difference (irrelevant), but not wins-draws-defeats in the football table. Goal difference is only relevant at the final day of the season, while overall form is something that can be of interest throughout the whole season. At least adding a way to see this would be useful, as the way most leagues show their tables in in this way (win draw loss, goals for, goals against, pts)."
Good app but most of times the navigation in most sections are very slow. It makes me easily bored of using it. Make the app more fast
"App has cool features and tons of data but I have really not liked the UI. You can just see the matches of a day instead of week. No way of customizing that and moving between days is very tedious instead of a simple swipe. No idea how this has so many downloads and this score, I am definitely moving to another one"
decent app for the best part. But they get formations extremely wrong on so many occasions.
generally OK but let down by the red warning that Comes up when a team has a goal scoring chance
Its good but it should speed up in geting data required
"It doesn't load the data quickly and even with good internet it keeps loading and says ""requested data couldn't be loaded"". Yet I have a fast internet connection. When a goal is disallowed it doesn't update quickly for some leagues. I like ""Big Chance"" only when it is a goal. Sometimes they show it for non goal chance. It'd have been better if ""Big Chance"" was reserved for sure goal only. Introduce ""Penalty"" alert"
This app has been giving me headache lately. It automatically add some teams to my favorites without clicking on them.
Surprisingly throw in stats are no longer available🚮
"Disaster app, old version much better!!!"
Please fix the odds view next to the list od games.
"Wait until you are sure it's goal ,couple of seconds don't mean nothing. This is annoying."
"Was an amazing app until the visual update, now its horrible. Games are shown in 2 lines with lots of widths, need to scroll a lot to find the games, I cant get used to it. After more than 10 years of praising this amazing app, I will consider trying others. Please revert some of the visual changes!"
"This is the 3rd time I'm reinstalling the app due to notification problems. Your app doesn't make the goal notification sound anymore despite turning it on for football. When I add teams to favourites, so many unnecessary & unselected teams start appearing randomly. Just too many turn off scenarios since you last update. Kindly fix it"
"Please bring back the Favourites Bin/ Trash can. Having to delete them one by one is ridiculous. Also the new favourites and my team's is rather messy. It was perfect before so really didn't need the change. I might convert to another App if the Bin at least doesn't come back. Sorry for non positive feedback, it's positive in one sense I suppose. I will give a 5 star if the Bin returns. Thanks."
"Was hoping the new version would let us change font colours. The red on black is a nightmare to read, especially on my Galaxy Watch. Other than that, the app is really good to use and all the important info is there."
"With the recent update, matches i star 🌟 and are added to my favorite now disappears immediately after the match without me even seeing the result of the match. Unlike before that i will have to remove the match from my favorite myself. What could be the cause. Matches don't stay in my favorite any longer."
"Trash app, very slow loading content, constant interruptions etceterax2.....bring back soccer24."
It doesn't play any highlight. It will just stop as soon as you click highlight
Delay in getting notification
"Great for the games live, but would be nice to only give the goal scored after any var check."
"Very good app, but lacks one very important feature. Can u please include more days just like soccerway has feature for games all season long... Even if u can't make it season long, can u please make it at least a month long? I hope u understand what i mean, just like u add today, tomorrow (say 12/3/19), till (13/3/19) yep in that order for at least a month or even more!!! Thanks and i look forward to this feature, this gives u an edge over most apps n a better rating too."
"Good app but your dark mode is so bad, why not use a color which is eye friendly. You're using amoled black as dark mode which is very disturbing to the eye. Why not use a dark gray or something that doesn't hurt the eyes especially at night. Apart from that, very good app."
This app is a mess after removal of My Teams tab. It's so hard to keep track of my teams now. It was the only thing which kept bringing me back since the last 6 years. I guess it's time I looked for an alternative.
No the best in tennis how can you not get notification when a player breaks on full-time or set results notification. Is like following a football match and you don't get notification when there is goal only full-time scores
well i envy this site but i dnt get update like i pick some games i want to be seeing there update goals but i wont show until i go back to the site and check the scores
The older my teams and my games layout was a lot better. Why fix a working feature. Should have stayed as it was. The new spaced layout for live games is a win. Very nice. I
I don't like the fact that it doesn't show the names of the basketball team and the profile of the basketball players
The previous version was super. Especially with the pining 📍and blinking features. They were the reason I choose this app. Please bring them back.
Please do something about the live commentary lag.. minus 30 secs is acceptable.. not 2 mins+
"It would be better if there were player's rating, profiles of managers, coaches, refs and more parameters of these profiles like trophies, market value, best club where the player was etc.."
The app keeps crushing after launching. This the third time i have uninstall then reinstall again. It works fine after a few days then it starts crushing again. I have sent the feedback message using the app.
The app is great with almost all the features needed in sport however there is one thing that puts me off is the table without loss of the team and draws that makes it almost irrelevant please add it there and if possible the chat section.if all that sort it will get my 5 stars for now no please
Please keep the old interface. Checking of statistics with the new interface is quite difficult as compared to the old one.
"This recent update is annoying and its too bold, colours everywhere Its so bold that you will have to scroll 📜 so far, up and down very far just to check on a single match and the standings lines that shows where both team are standing is too poor, the line is not bright enough or colorful to see it clearly"
"Odds for most of the leagues are not shown. You need to go to flashscore on your pc to get the odds. Still same issue, no odds like Estonia league, Lithuania league and so on. Overall application is good."
Maybe some backend testing before the biggest tournament would have been a good idea. The app is uselessly slow and constantly throwing errors.
"App is laggy after the last update. It becomes bigger and heavier, therefore very slow and choppy. I have pretty fast device, so developers should do something for better user exp."
It used my best app until after i updated the app this week. The pop up adverts are really terrible even when I'm not on the app. I am thinking of deleting the app. Do something about this quickly please.
"Favorite matches notifications don't work recently, no Match begins or goal alerts from favorites... Score alert comes after about 30 seconds or 1 minute, comparing with many other alternatives."
"The spacing, lines and bars are too wide.. please make it more compatible so that more data could be accommodated on the phone screen at once."
"Why did the odds feature disappear ? Asides checking live scores and H2H stats , odds feature is very important and I can't find it anymore , I hope this is just system glitch and that the feature will reappear . Please do something about it ASAP"
I upgraded my Samsung phone and i can't seem to select the flashscore whistle notification sound. I updated the app and still no solace. I might have to delete the app.
Too slow to my liking. It would have to run for some seconds before it open. The earlier was better than the latter
old version was the best!!
it delays too much when refreshing
Previous version was very neat and you could have a panoramic view of the fixtures and the H2H without wasting time scrolling down. Functionality degradation at its best
"the app is a good one. but it's so slow. takes so long to load everything you tap. please try and work on it. aside that, it's an excellent app."
"Used to be best and fastest app going but now really slow, app sometime doesn't load up and when it does it lags when scrolling up and down. Running version 3.11.1"
Used to think this was the top app for live updates but the new layout is terrible also if the app isn't used in some time it won't open. I'm back to Livescore for my updates now as the layout is far better.
"Excellent App, but very very slow loading. It loads very very slow even with 4G+ network. Such a shame to a great application."
The spacing is just too big. Put matches & scores horizontally like before. It made it easier to compare teams.
After the new update switching from live games to favorites have been a problem. Immediately you switch it tells you no network after loading for more than a minute. Please do something about it if possible
"the app takes toooooo long to open. why? it sometimes says ""no internet connection "". please work on it because if you fix it, can be among the best sports app in the system."
I guess Your flash score is having problem with notification and voice notification command .. everything comes late and I don't know why it happen like this ..it is only soccer24 that always have it alright but you guys have deleted that app.please work on this flash score problem
Please we need the old version of this app because we can't find our betting odds on this app except the game is about to play!! We can't find live odds too when the game is on! Including the notification sounds! Please work on it Please!! please!!
Recently (last 2 weeks) it keeps crashing after about 15 seconds or so. I see other people have been having the same issue. Can you guys please sort this out thank you.
why does the basketball scores for some matches so slow. the time and score in the app usually differs with real time and score. Thats really bad.
"Keeps telling me app not supported,& I have to go bkwards & forwards to open it, it went like that continuously about 2 weeks ago & it still does it, so it causes me to not use it nearly as much, I was really pleased with it up untill then"
"I'm getting frustrated with flashscore of late. Almost every week, I have to uninstall and install. You'll use it today, tomorrow, then the next; cannot open. I fear the app is crushing slowly."
"Never seen app with so simple use but so many spammy notifications. Just use sofascore Update: u can also disable them by default and let users enable them if they want to, no other live score up sends me game recap and similiar stuff."
Loved flashscore until now where I can't even connect to the app yet every other app works. Fairly sure the update is messing with the app.
The app design is very good. But its too heavy and takes time to load. Can you consider designing a lighter version?
I have been trying to register with my Google account for audio commentary. Since it said it has sent email where I will verify. No inbox till now and I am getting annoyed.
"This version i give it 2 stars, just switched from soccer24 this app is a downgrade- terrible UI -takes too long to load please discontinue this app and let soccer24 continue 😔, please send me link to re download soccer24 i made a mistake uninstalling it before testing this app."
Not so good. The writings are too tiny that needs magnifying glass .remember that the App is used by the aged citizens also. Please act on the same Or additionly it should be made to zoom
Guys the change was good but have different color while checking for team standing. I mean when checking head to head for two teams let there be different colour highlighting the teams
Doesnt copy the settings from desktop version despite being logged in to both. Short of tht does everything a livescore app does
Tour newest update we don't like it...... Now if you pick teams as your favorite it will not indicate it at the favorite not even the number of team you need to be connecting the number of teams your self you can't even clear all favorite you nned to be removing it one by one
What Happened to app. It used to be quicker and efficient. Now days it take a whole minute to buffer as I wait fot it open yet I am using one the latest pnone.. that uses 4g network. Or you have so many subscriber that why it's becoming slow?
"update is nice but the app keeps on telling me ""app has unfortunately stopped"".sometimes too, it ends games whilst they are live on other score apps and also gives wrong odds .I think more are is to be done"
This app can do better. - Add players ratings (football) - Allow us to choose whether or not to receive notifications of all matches from favourite league.
"Well, this App is an all time favourite and best one for sports persons. But then, this App must work smarter like at first though updated. It keeps lagging. This App is the best"
The app is very excellent and user friendly but the main problem is that it keeps on stopping after using it untill i uninstall and download it again.I have downloaded it more than 18 times.Please fix this
"It's the best app. I believe it,but the problem is it take more and more data. & It doesn't opened by weak data."
"Ever since my latest update, the app only opened twice. it's just loading and loading and then tells you no internet access. Kindly help me out"
"Meh, it's OK. Does the job. Doesn't let you personalise favourite competitions though, so you've gotta scroll forever."
"1.Head to head does not show the type of game say league , friendly etc 2.table doesn't stipulate the current form Update to sort out that please for my 4 stars If you can give a daily odd 5 ticket based on statistics...which can win 3times a week minimum,I would give my 5star"
"The odds should be on the 1st page not click on the match to see the odds, that's how we make our money SOCCER24 online is still way better."
there are nonsettimg for decimal odds ...everething else is working ok...
"My Outlook sporadically gives notifications and pops up on my screen. Sometimes no notification dot. Everything is turned on, turned up. It's updated, I've uninstalled and reinstalled, support suggested deleting my account and adding it back, but I'm afraid to do that. I thought it was because I have a different phone, but I'm not sure now. I've been missing important emails. I get them all and have no other problems other than the lack of notifications. I had no problems on my other phone."
"I used this app for years without any serious problems. With this latest update, it constantly asks me to sign in to the main email address I'm using it for. Once I do that, it kicks me out with an error message. This happens without exception, even after uninstalling/reinstalling the app as well as restarting my phone. This error renders this app completely useless."
"I love having easy access to my email, but this app is so aggravating. The latest thing is that the swipe for predictive text is back. I remember being able to turn that off previously and did immediately because it's irritating and incorrect 85% of the time. I can't find anywhere to turn it off now. It should be an *optional* feature, I don't want it and am likely to stop using the app for emails if I can't get it to stop."
Used to be an ok app. For quite some time now I have had trouble sending or cannot send emails. They fail to get sent and get put into the outbox which does not give an option to resend. Sometimes shutting the phone down and restarting would cause it to send but now that doesn't even work. Also the app no longer finds any emails in any folders other than the main inbox. Trying a different app right now which seems to be awesome. Ten times better!
"I love Outlook for my phone and PC. However,the app is very glitchy on Chromebook, which is designed to run android apps. The app will not let me view individual accounts, but instead defaults to all accounts. I can view all emails from their for all accounts, but when sending mail, I have to remember to choose which accoun to send from. It also forces me to scan through all my emails just to find the emails from work, thus mixing them all together"
"Edit: I have to use this app for work and I don't like using it. I don't understand why there are two drop down menus when you open an email. I hate the location of the ""compose email"" and that it goes across my messages. I can't the app to link to my desktop calendar. It synced with one month and that's it I like this app for the most part. The only problem I've come across is trying to edit a calendar event date"
"I normally love using Outlook for my email app and even linked my Gmail account to use Outlook. As others have stated, I'm getting notifications for ALL junk mail. I checked my settings and I'm only supposed to get notifications for Focused inbox. Lately, my battery has been draining faster and I'm attributing this to Outlook running more in the background for Junk! I don't mind the ad so much, annoying yes, but the notification for junk needs to get fixed ASAP."
"The junk/spam mail is basically nonexistent now. Over the past few months, so much junk is filtered into the Focused Inbox and results in dozens of notifications a day to my device. Tried messing with settings in app, on phone, and in the main mailbox on desktop. Of course marking as much as possible as junk/phishing. Nothing has worked. It's incredibly annoying."
"This has almost everything I need. However, a huge galre is that the mobile calendar does not sync with the desktop app. Even with the same accounts linked up. A huge headache that makes me migrate to the default Google Calendar app. It would be nice if my calendar events would show on my lock screen like they used to with the Google Calendar."
"The UI is nice but some critical features don't work. Example push notifications show an email, if you click the email it opens the email with a blank screen. It then marks the email as read. You have to quit out of the app to see the email. Terrible experience with this bug... Update: 23.3.10 Darkmode is supported however the initial loader is a completely white screen. Bit of a blinding transition."
"Junk Filter is Broken! While Outlook for Windows Desktop is fine and has a perfectly capable spam filter, the Android version apparently has none of it. I get emails that are obvious, undoubtedly spam & scam in my inbox... and it's up to me to mark them as junk/phishing. Isn't the app supposed to do that? It's enough of a nuisance that I moved my accounts to another app and uninstalled Outlook from my phone."
"It has trouble doing its job. Maybe when Microsoft puts more effort into developing a mature email product, it will be able to keep the inbox and calendar updated. But cut Microsoft some slack, it's a small indie tech firm and email is a very new protocol. With more time and funding, they'll get it right."
"Works fine, but I don't like the way it shows the E-mail folders. It's always expanded, and, in my case, is a long list. It should have a expand/contract button on each folder with subfolder and remember my list use. Just like the web and desktop versions do."
"Used to be perfect. Recently several issues have appeared. 1. Contacts in Outlook app disappear, also from the Android contacts app, and any other app that uses contacts. After several hours, they reappear. Using a PC browser, the contacts are there. 2. When I bring Outlook back up, the icon at the top left is missing, so I cant change folders. I need to click on calendar or contacts, then back on email for it to reappear. From 5 starts to 2...."
"Revising my review down. There's been an ongoing issue with Outlook's sync calendar function, where it randomly disables itself. I rely on Android's built in calendar for notifications on my phone and watch. There are a few MSFT forums describing identical issues across multiple devices, with no solution to the problem."
"It's great when it works... Which is usually about ⅓ of the time I need to use it. It doesn't even crash per se. I just get a dark screen with the word “reorder” centered at the bottom of the screen and three lines across underneath that. Can't click on anything and when I close the app and open again, I'm right back at the dark page. Typically it resets to normal within 4-6 hrs. Too much of a time lag for me. Few problems with the Windows version."
"The overall mail management features and settings are lacking on this app. In particular, there are barely any junk mail settings. I can't manually enter in domains to block, so I'm stuck trying to block individual emails which often doesn't work since spammers use random emails all the time. Half the time I still get spam from blocked emails. Outlook's spam filter has been practically non-existent for the last year or so, so I get flooded with junk. On top of it all, there are ads now."
"The app used to be great at weeding out the junk email. Now, for some reason, every single spam, junk, or phishing email is sent to my focused inbox. It notifies me every time, and I have to sort through a few dozen emails just to find my important ones. I've checked every setting, and nothing has helped. It's extremely frustrating that it won't filter out these emails anymore."
"This app used to work well, but now it's very buggy and can't seem to differentiate between real emails from saved contacts and junk. My important emails have been relegated to junk folder and now my inbox is being filled with junk/spam/scam emails. It also freezes and crashes when trying to toggle accounts and/or folders. What used to work seemlessly and be a convenient tool is now a lot more frustration and work than it's worth. I am going to have to change to an email app that works."
MS now forces use of Edge to open links in emails. I've used Outlook for email for years. I have always been able to choose what browser I wanted to open a link in an email. Outlook now defaults to Edge in spite of my phone not having a default browser set. I will likely begin using a different email app on my phone. Choice is important to me. It's not my responsibility to bolster use of MS's browser. If I wanted to use it in all cases I would already be doing so.
"While there are many positive things about the Outlook app...including organizing by file folders, and the ability to look at multiple accounts easily, there are also problems. The app does not switch between folders at times, and you have to open and close the app to get it to work. It also will not delete messages. It also will not identify non-junk messages after marking them as such. These are basic functions that should work. Very disappointed."
"Been using this for a long time. A recent update now prompts you to download Microsoft Edge browser when opening links, instead of automatically using your default browser. Given that I've already gone through the trouble of setting my system-wide default browser (Firefox Focus) I find it incredibly presumptuous and annoying that Microsoft is trying to sneak their browser in like this."
"You would think an app from Microsoft would be handy and useful, but this app does the bare minimum. It's as if the app was made only to receive email notifications and look at or delete emails. You cannot block senders, delete folders, and loads of other features that you would have to do on a computer browser. Why create an app with limited features that still requires us to go on a computer to access other functions?"
"Probably the worst app on my phone and the worst part is that I need it for work. The refresh lags significantly. I'll get a push notification about an email, open the Outlook app and it takes a solid 1-2 minutes just to load the updated inbox. Not to mention writing emails is problematic since it seems to have its own terrible autocorrect function built in separate from my phone's that I can't remove. I just want it to be simple and useful!"
"I like the Outlook app. However, there are too many features you can get on the computer that you cannot get on the Outlook android app. For example, you cannot do High Important, and you are way more limited what options you get in the filter, e.g. you cannot have emails show up in Due Date order, etc. Have used apps like the Nine email app, and it has a lot more and better features. Would really appreciate it if features like these can be added."
"This app seems to be devolving from where it was, to the sorry state that it's in now, much like all of my MS apps for Android. (I'm looking squarely at you Bing, you flaming pile of garbage) I've toggled badge notifications on and off 20 times, and it still insists on showing them. I have notifications set for events only, not mail. But for some reason it has an extreme desire to show me everything. This thing is a resource hog and a battery drain of the highest order. I wish I could delete it."
"Works or doesn't, mostly doesn't. All I can see for the past week now is a colored bar at the top, a ""...reorder"" menu at the bottom, and nothing else but white. Won't load emails, wont display anything else, no navigation, nothing. Even when it DID work, half the time it wouldn't sync. Setting up accounts is a nightmare too. Can't get web outlook to work either, so I cant read work emails away from my laptop. Email is such a basic, fundamental app. You'd think it wouldn't be this much hassle."
"Calendar view is annoying!! When I open the app, half the time it's in Agenda View, and there is not option to switch to month view at all. Then today randomly pops up a very handy month view, and now can't get back to it. No settings to change... just shows whatever view it wants. As a calendar it is very annoying to just see one day at a time. I expect a lot better from one of the oldest software companies out there. Oldest? Needless to say there is work to be done on this app."
"It's a no for me. Google drive is just much more intuitive & the app itself works faster. Day one into using One Drive & it keeps telling me my upload is waiting for wifi, but I never left wifi. Too often the app has a fairly large spinning loading thing, showing that the app is refreshing, even when there's no new content to be loaded. It drives me nuts."
"This app let's so many spam emails through, it is absolutely annoying as hell. They also don't have several features that the desktop version does. Namely, sweep all from one sender. I used that the most. I continually block email addresses only to have that exact same email come back to my other box. Or that email address sends more. Block doesn't work, sweep is missing, annoying."
"My work requires me to have this, and it gets 2 stars for letting me read and respond to urgent emails. Literally the bare minimum. Everything else just kinda...sucks. Even basic stuff. How is it 2023 and the only way for me to navigate to a specific folder is to scroll through every folder I've ever created? Just put a search box at the top of the folder list, like the one that appears when you want to move an email to a folder. And let me collapse subfolder trees in the giant list."
"Email does what I need, though not having a way to permanently block offensive ads being served in it is an issue. Also calendar is useless. Can't update events, they have to be manually deleted multiple times and reinput from scratch, it changes notification settings on events when posting, so even though notification is set to ""none"", it posts as ""on day of at 'x time'"" which makes the editing events lack of functionality all the more frustrating."
"It's a garbage app on Android. Simply writing an email is excruciating because it breaks many of the functions that I use on my keyboard. The ""top results"" of search is also garbage. It often picks less relevant emails from years ago over en exact title match from this week. And the Office apps integration is broken. If I didn't need to use Outlook for my university email, then i would throw it away and be far happier for it."
"The app is fine, it notifies you of events and although it takes a bit of customization, that part is alright. However the default ""Holidays in the United States"" includes only Christian holidays. I looked up if you could change this and supposedly you can, however After 35 minutes of searching I cannot find a ""Files"" button with a Jewish holidays option. This could be user error, but its very disappointing to have the option so burried--maybe not even there. The FAQ didn't have answers either."
"Have to use for work. Typing in recipient box a search list of names popup but are invisible. Have to tap a spot where I think the recipient email address should be. Drafted a work email and needed to switch sender name before sending when to my horror the email ""poof"" disappeared. No draft saved. Gone. The desktop app allows the switch, thought phone app would be the same. My trusty pixel4 nearly came to an end while seething."
The software is better than similar apps. I am not sure why this is not a full fledged Desktop Outlook with the exact components as the desktop version and most importantly Contacts. This app really would need to behave as the desktop version especially for people who are working on Microsoft 365 in their day to day operations.
"The app can be tricky to use but worked fine, however since the last update it won't sync at all. Can't open my emails at all I get the notification but that's it. This is a big problem because outlook is used as the work place email, set up by the place I work, so big problems to make sure I don't miss anything"
"Ads ads ads ads ads. I want to love it more. And I know the haters are going to hate and say well it's free you should expect ads. Now I have four separate computers, that I had to pay for a Windows license,. Now I feel like I've already paid Microsoft enough for a Windows license, can't I just get an email client without ads for free? I understand if you need the 365 software, and is a bonus you'll lose your ads. But really? Can I just give you three bucks a year? Great email client, but ads."
"While there's a lot I like about the android version of Outlook, there are some huge problems with the app that MS doesn't seem to care about fixing. The biggest problem is that folder level notifications don't work if you create rules to move mail on outlook desktop. This is even more frustrating considering the fact the stock Android mail app is able to display said notifications. It would be nice if MS could at least admit they don't care about fixing this and/or explain why it's broken."
"Great until a new update made it literally unusable. If Microsoft is storing anything for you other than emails (whether you know it or not) and you go over their small free limit (or it my case had it involuntarily decreased in an update), you actually cannot send any emails. I spent hours trying to clear out storage, and it still wasn't near enough. You can pay for more storage, but their most basic plan starts at $20/month. Not cool. I discovered this when trying to send an urgent email too."
"It's Outlook at its decline. But it's still outlook. And a go to option for companies with nice pockets. To pull cash from for the premium stuff that was once free and included with a single purchase for as long as that device was compliant. without a monthly subscription. And fully included all the bells and whistles. Now it's just one after another, the old for years features. People familiar with all the systems former features are being weinded out so the or the timing is is profit perfect"
"App has so many issues, randomly gets stuck zoomed in, sometimes I can't hit the auto complete email from the address book, I tap it and nothing happens so I have to fully type out the email. If you are trying to multitask with this app everytime you leave it, it has to reload so it resets everything you were doing, and if you half way typing an email and then say you need to copy something from a website, it will delete half your email when you switch back and forth."
The Outlook app has gone down in the way it functions. It no longer will show a new email unless you click on the notification. The 'other' folder will not load those emails even after clicking on the 'load more messages.' I'm stuck having to go through an internet browser to have all of my emails show up.
"Worked fairly well till the latest update. Now I can't enter events into the calendar on my phone app and save them and have them show up later. It's like I never entered the event. Nothing shows up. Very very unhandy. The desktop app works though. No problem creating/ saving events on there. I like the app otherwise. Would update star rating if problem gets fixed soon. And by the way, as a graphic designer myself, I don't care for the new icon. Poor design. The old one was much, much better!"
"It works pretty well on my Chromebook, if you are looking for the simplest way to send an email. However, there are no features to access your address book, you cannot change font (although you can bold, italicize, and underline through your ctrl options), the difficulty of scrolling and not being able to add pictures to your signature, which are my two biggest concerns as I use outlook for business purposes."
"Another update and another function goes down. Now every time I want to add an event to my calendar, the app just shuts down. I guess it's an improvement on the app crashing after I open it, but still renders that useless in a mobile environment. I have cleared my cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the program, and restarted my phone. It might work once, and then it just fails."
"I turned to Outlook when Google killed Inbox, and by and large I'm pretty happy with it. It's easier to find emails than Gmail, although the search function is weaker than the native Gmail system. The deal breaker just came last week when I started getting ads embedded in my emails from Outlook. After clicking on some by accident, it wreaked my experience with the product. I already pay for Microsoft Office, I don't want to have to put up with ads in a product I already pay to use."
"Hate the New Features! You have to be able to take multiple steps to open a link to a web browser and I only found this out after almost an hour of searching before stumbling on it by accident! Having it open to their web browser (which is horrible) is confusing/time consuming. Things are more tedious and less user friendly on this version. Something I didn't think was possible. Plus, could you please finally allow users to have larger text? Also, start with the person we are sending to!"
"Works much better on mobile or without keyboard / mouse. I love Outlook on iOS and Android and want to use it on Chrome OS too, but simple things are much more complicated than they should be. For instance, scrolling up/down in an open email requires putting the mouse cursor all the way on the right side of the screen where you'd expect the scroll bar to be. You can't just scroll down in the email with the trackpad. Selecting text is also next to impossible. Also needs better shortcut support"
"I've used Outlook for years in both personal and corporate environments. I've also installed, managed, configured and maintained Exchange server with custom Outlook applications multiple times. But I have never experienced the types of issues I've experienced using Outlook on Android. Suffice it to say, I'm a tad displeased as I really like Outlook. I noticed the other day that Outlook has not pulled emails in since 08/13/2020. I have another email client, so it's not a ""show stopper."" Fix it!"
"App does the basic, but it has one very fatal flaw. Once you expand a folder there is no possible method to collapse said folder. Meaning if you have a large folder hierarchy with several levels of subfolders, this quickly becomes unusable for enterprise users. There are numerous threads on the internet about this and appears to have been an issue since the launch of the app years ago and it just never gets fixed. I will update my review should this get fixed, but I'm not holding my breath."
The idea is nice but execution is garbage. When you refresh your inbox it doesn't update sub-folders. So in order to truly check your email you have to go into each folder and refresh. Absolutely ridiculous. Most of the time it doesn't actually update. I see an email in my inbox on the computer but when I refresh on my phone it doesn't show up. Also can't view shared calendars. Expected much more.
"After an update about 2 weeks ago, the app no longer properly syncs with my accounts. 80% of the time, messages do not show in the inbox open opening. Killing the process and restarting occasionally helps. Something there is a ""Load more messages"" button - doesn't really work. Most of the new mail notifications do not pop up in the status bar. Messing with the sync/notification settings had no effect. The app used to work fine, pretty much unusable now, shame."
"Forced to install because of my college. Otherwise the app is ok at best. I really don't like how you can't star important emails. One time I tried to create my own ""important"" folder of emails, but after a while I tried going back to find the folder I created to be gone? I had to scroll through all my emails just to find that one email that used to be in that folder I had. The layout is very difficult to read, just too much unnecessary stuff to sort through just to get to where I need to go."
"Use this for work email. I have rules to automatically place incoming emails to subfolders, but this app will not send a notification when this happens. You only get notified for emails delivered to your inbox. Many emails are missed because of this. Looking at forums, and apparently this has been a huge issue since 2015, but still not fixed. Would be great if this was resolved."
"This app used to be good... But then they decided to start having ads. Would also be nice if the app was more like the actual site. A nice chunk of my emails go to junk and there is no way to access my junk folder, only my ""spam"". When viewing on a PC, there is no spam folder, only junk. Both of which contain different emails. Would be great if they would have the same thing the site has."
"There are some basic things driving me crazy that I feel shouldn't be an issue with a big company with tons of resources like Microsoft. If I'm on a phone call and get an email, the notification sounds directly in my ear, so loud. Also, when I get a notification it doesn't just ding once, it dings repeatedly every few minutes until I clear it. The only way to stop it is by silencing notifications, which I don't want to do for emails because I'm obligated to use this app for work. The last thing is the calendar, which can only be visualized in one day, three day, or month increments. I really wish I could see 5 and/or 7 days at a time. I also have to scroll to see an entire day- the most you can visualize is exactly from like 9 AM-5 PM. I like the desktop app, though."
"It worked fine. Then an update and now email in my trash folder shows my address instead of the senders address. Been working with support on this for the last few hours without resolution. I've tried all they have suggested without any success. In fact, some of their ""fixes"" were setbacks - one even stopped me from being able to connect to my primary email until I deleted and then reconnected the account. It's simple to fix ... the problem started after an update so fix the update!"
"As others have commented, this used to be my go-to app but apparently the last update has broken it and it crashes every time I try to open the sent folder and is unable to reopen (because the sent folder is still selected). If I uninstall, reinstall, and set it up all over again, it works for one use before going back to crashing. I hope this gets fixed because it used to be a great app."
I read a review about a blank screen so I was hesitant to upgrade/ installing it. I was basically forced to upgrade because the message kept coming up on my screen not allowing me to see my emails until I did so. I finally installed it and now I get what the other reviewee meant. There is a 10-15 second blank white screen that appears before my actual emails come up. I liked the older version. Please fix this!!
"The signature block doesn't support graphics. Not being able to duplicate the signature block of the full version is ridiculous. It's Microsoft, I would expect more. But like all their products I'm sure that's a feature you have to pay for. Disappointed in the top email app! No frills, just a basic service. This would be a great app 10 years ago."
"Generally OK, but a lot of buggy behaviors. Most of the time I will get multiple email notifications for the same email hours apart. Sometimes after reading a message I go to delete it, only to have it show up again and again. I have to close the app and kill the process to be able to delete messages when that happens. Using the folders on my email accounts through outlook is a pain. Outlook makes me choose a single email in order to view the folders."
"The updated app isn't very useful. It does not seem like there is anyway to view the junk email box anymore. With the aggressive filters, many important emails get filtered to junk the first time. Same thing with draft emails, if you save a draft, good luck finding it inside the app. Both issues require using the browser web app. Not very useful, like the basic email program that came with the phone. Old version was much better. Moved from 5 stars to 2."
"This app is extremely buggy. I'm not sure what Microsoft is doing but their iOS version is miles ahead of this one. More often than not, the app does not open when you hit the icon, it just shows the Outlook logo. In the last hour the app keeps notifying me of the same emails over and over even though I've already read the emails. I have notification sounds on, and every other app works properly except for Outlook. Been waiting for updates to fix these issues, and no luck yet."
"This application feels like a barebones port of the program, with little to no functionality in regards to more complex messaging functions. I could not reply to a message to two different people separately, without including emails to each other on this occasion, but have had other issues historically. If you rely on mobile email functionality for urgent/important business, you're better off using your phone as a wifi hotspot for a computer."
"After a recent update, new emails will periodically stop showing up in my inbox, although I still get the notifications for them as they come in. The emails do show up in Samsung email, Outlook for Windows ect. It's just this Android app. After a period of time the app starts working again and all the emails suddenly appear at the same time. Hopefully they can resolve this issue soon because it worked well otherwise."
"So, it's fine, sometimes great. But on Chromebooks, which are a thing and which Microsoft really needs to acknowledge, it's nigh unusable because it does not recognize the return/enter key as anything. I have no idea what it thinks that key does, but it's not add a new line. It seems to try to jump out of whatever text box you're writing in. So, it does a great job alerting me I have an email, but replying to that email is absolute torture."
"Not a great app. It tells me I have a new email, but I have to shut off wifi for it to show up in my inbox. Now after an update, the app crashes and I can't view any of my emails. Trying to reply to a message that has been forwarded is about impossible sometimes. Just to many quirks and bugs for me to give it any higher of a rating."
"Edit my review? I can't add new review? I have used this app for years but it appears to have lost functions or made them more difficult to use or find. The process of adding contacts and also editing contacts is no longer as straight forward as it used to be, hence I have lost important emails. I would have thought if you tap the contact in an email the option to save contact would appear like it used to. Very round about way of saving contacts now. Frustrating!"
"Good for managing mails in different accounts, and for calendar, to-do etc. However, it keeps sending repeat notifications for the same emails - two, three, four, more times in a day. Really irritating and needlessly distracting. I've tried Force Stop, clear cache, restart, but it keeps doing it. A quick Google shows it's been a problem for literally years. Please fix it, Microsoft."
"Two issues to report: 1. When I switch from email account to another, it happens most of the time that it keeps showing the inbox of the first account. I get to close the app several times to make it work. It is really a pain. 2. ""Mark as read"" doesn't work most of the time. Again, I get to close the app several times, and sometimes, I get to open all the emails individually to mark them as read."
"For some reason, my calendar sync keeps resetting and unsyncing. I always have to go and manually allow it again. It's important for me since it's my work email! It only happens on my S23 Ultra. It works fine on my Z fold 4 for some reason. Tried uninstalling the app and redownloading and it hasn't fixed it. Very annoying! I don't want to have to download another calendar for it to work properly."
"The app would be great if it wasn't so unstable, it freezes way too often, and on basic tasks at that. Just opening a mail or moving it to a folder is sometimes enough to make it freezes 1-3 seconds or even crash. It's packed with great features, with a simple and intuitive interface, but unfortunately all this does not matter if the app is a pain to use. (I only get these issues on the Outlook app, all my other apps and games work great)."
"I have to use this app because of my company's strict policies around email. I don't have an issue with emails, other than being cumbersome, but the calendar sync to native android sometimes does not update and you have to disable and re-enable the sync to get the updates. Now for some reason, I keep finding the calendar sync option is disabled on its own, I have to constantly re-enable."
"1.. Scheduled ""do not disturb"" doesn't work. The ""zzz"" is still there when it shouldn't be. 2. When the password changes (work account), it is impossible to re-login (""unable to login"" message). This problem happens since a very long time ago, and it was never fixed. So annoying. The only workaround is uninstall/reinstall (delete the app's data isn't enough). This problem does not happen with Teams (the re-login works fine)"
"All of a sudden, I get no sound with my notifications. I double and triple checked all my settings there is no reason why I would suddenly not get a sound notification. The icon still appears on my phone but if I'm not looking at my phone, I don't know that I got a new message. I've tried everything others have suggested like reinstalling, excetera and nothing is helping."
"Seems to be getting more clunky with each update. Now when I reply, it hides the email chain by default. When I tap to write a new email, the cursor begins in the 'to' field, then abruptly jumps to the email body. There are now intrusive ads at the top of the inbox that look like emails. Overall, this app is falling further and further behind the browser equivalent."
"It worked great for years, but then suddenly something happened with their spam filters - when I sent a ticket they just said there was an issue and it had been resolved. It clearly hasn't been. I get constant spam each day, and mark it all as such, and continue to get it. What's going on? I don't want to switch email addresses but this is getting ridiculous."
"It's ok, but you can't manage anything really to do with your folders or anything like that. What's more, if you don't have an actual computer, you can't manage your folders even if you're using the desktop view of the outlook page in a web browser. It makes it so you have to go find a laptop or desktop that someone is willing to lend you to sort out stuff. It's incredibly inconvenient, even though the function should be relatively simple."
"The app was running smoothly, and then about a month or so ago, an update came out and introduced a lot of issues. 1) My outlook accounts stay connected, but calendar sync randomly disables itself, requiring a manual re-enable 2) Mt gmail work account works for about an hour, then it goes out of sync and no longer receives emails or updates. The required fix is to go into the app, select the account, and ""reset account"". Hope they fix it in short order. I'm disappointed right now."
WHAT is going on with Outkook?! I've used this for years. Never had any issues. The last few weeks. Constant spam coming through into my inbox. Doesn't matter if I block or mark phishing. And now you want us to pay for no ads and keep putting stupid ads in inboxes! Are you joking? You can't even provide a decent service for free never mind prove you can provide a better one with MORE money. As if Microsoft needs my money!
"I have turned on auto sync of calendar, but for the past weeks, the app will auto turn off. I have to turn on again to sync to my phone's calendar, but it's auto off next day. These 2 days, it does not turn off, but only 1 or 2 event are sync. All other meetings/events are missing. Frustrating."
"Since the newest update, the app now prompts me to re-enter the passwords for various email accounts several times a day, extremely annoying. Also, search is still completely useless. Enter the same searchterm on desktop and mobile, and look at the difference - ridiculous. Desktop will find everything you expect, while mobile shows random Emails that have nothing to do with your search, if it shows anything at all."
"All right, OK Microsoft I was using Outlook as my primary and only email client since quite some time for my own mail and my company mail. It was working quite, OK. Since the last update, though I still don't have problems, but I am getting one very, very annoying pop-up message that I have to sign in to my company One drive account. I am signed in, and I am using all company resources without any troubles, but whatever I do, I can not get rid of the pop-up message! Pls, do something!"
"I do not receive notifications at all since the last update. Emails come through, but I have to check manually every single time to see any of them. Tried to contact support, and my messages went into a black hole. For a service used by so many companies it's not very reliable."
"The app keeps re-pushing notifications of read emails. Somethimes even a minute after I've read them. Sometimes an hour afterwards. Super annoying. Other than that, Outlook is my go-to email app. Edit: three months after my review, the re-pushing notifications still aren't fixed. So, I lowered my rating from 3 stars to 2."
"App use to work really well but, recently I can't send emails! When I reply it tells me drafts. I communicated with the Outlook and them yell me that others are having issues too, keep looking for a final! That was over 3 weeks ago! This is now January 2023 over 5 months and you haven't solved these problems! Most disappointing 5/11/23 still no improvement in this app. Can't reply to emails or search for an email! You have had ample time to correct problem!"
"Reasonable email application but there are some pretty annoying bugs. To start the notifications are just messed up. When a new email comes in for the ""other"" inbox it send a notification but lists the email from the primary inbox...even if that email had been deleted already. This obviously gets confusing and annoying."
"You got to be kidding with this app. Who seeks permission to edit and delete all your email messages and contacts when adding an email account from Gmail. The way permission is written can be misunderstood as it excludes the word user. Tried the app with a mailbox, but it doesn't seem to collect new messages. May be running it with a gmail mailbox and gmail app might not be mirroring correctly."
"Works fine for email, but constantly is dropping all of my contacts from the app. Thankfully, it isn't deleting them completely, I just have to uninstall and reinstall the app. It happens about weekly, sometimes more often."
"About 3 times a week, I have to login through a browser as emails sit in my outbox. The only way I can fix this problem is to delete the app and download it again. Other than those issues, the app is fine for multiple accounts."
"Keeps sending me notifications for the same email that has been read for several days. I get notifications for this email dozens of times per day. I have tried force stopping the app, and clearing cache. I do not want to permanently delete this email, because it's important."
I keep getting the same notification from an email I got this morning. The email has been deleted and when I check the notification there is nothing there. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and all that. Still happening. It's annoying.
"It's a solid email platform. However, I've started getting notifications for blocked email addresses. There are a handful of blocked addresses I receive such notifications for many times daily. Very irritating."
The search is mostly useless. I use the search to find emails sent from a spammer or a business that thinks good marketing is daily sale emails. There is no way to mass delete them. None. Useless. I have to log into my email from a web browser on my phone to do anything more than view emails.
"Update: Two stars... emails are finally loading a bit faster and more reliably. However, there are still points where the app hangs and the interface is still weak."
"Since the most recent update, I have lost sync with all my Outlook contacts several times. The only way to restore them is to manually ""reset account"" and then re-sync contacts on my Android phone. Please fix this!"
"As bad as it can be! For ever only 30 mails are shown in the app, all the rest aren't accessible in the inbox, I'm only using the Web version to see my emails and the application ONLY for the last 30 or so, too bad Microsoft!"
"Takes a lot of system resource to install. Requires care during setup. Probably best to choose sms for secondary authentication. If sms not selected, app will insist on other method such as Microsoft Authenticator. Once in use, beware of switch between ""focused or other"". This can make some emails disappear. I have disabled this function. If one wants to save incoming email to contacts on android phone, there is no easy way to do this. Generally disappointed with this app."
"Has generally been good, up until 3 weeks ago, I've been spam emailed by the same email address 30+ times per day for the last 3 weeks. I try to block the sender, doesn't work, I mark as Spam, doesn't work. I've requested help, no response. This is a last ditch effort to try get some help with this issue, failing a response I'll be changing emails."
"Pretty bad. Fails to recognize the start of several songs correctly, and starts them in the middle instead. In addition, it has a very difficult time telling when it is and isn't closed, so even if you exit the app, it might show up on the screensaver or top bar. I pretty much only use it because it's ad free and I can create playlists."
"The main reason I tried this app was it was highly recommended for its ability to import windows wpl playlists. Out of 13 playlists with a total of 509 songs, all 13 were imported but only 209 songs were included. Only three playlists were 100% complete. Two had zero songs and the rest (9) had anywhere from 1 out of 45 to 22 of 29. Overall only 41% of songs made their intended playlist. Additionally I find the process of building playlists with app tedious and clunky. Desktop version much better"
"I often use VLC as a music player, and it's nice overall. Simple, ad free, etc. 2 big issues I have with it though. First, it sometimes fails to start songs at the beginning. I'm not sure why. Second, it doesn't stop playing content. I pause it. Close it. Remove the notification. Even go into the settings and force stop the app. But if my phone connects to a Bluetooth device or plays media elsewhere, the app starts right up. I had to uninstall it because I couldn't prevent it from playing music."
I love the desktop version of VLC more than my first born child but the app version has a lot of issues. When I pause using Bluetooth earbuds the app often closes the audio I'm listening to. When I switch apps while watching a video it rarely continues working when I return and I have to close and restart the app. This might be just my taste but the screen volume/brightness controls seem unnecessary and are more likely to be a bother than a useful tool. I have hope for the future though.
VLC on pc has been going downhill for a decade now and the mobile version is no exception. Random glitches like videos playing as audio with the first-frame thumbnail as the video feed. Constantly losing its place in longer playlists. Playing only the final second of a file when replayed. All these simple functions that VideoLAN used to excel at that have been suffocated by feature creep being crammed down its throat. Makes me wistful of the non-cell-shaded traffic cone icon of the early 2000s.
"Great player! Only issue is from the latest update. Previous versions didn't have this issue. Now if I'm using it in my car (or with Bluetooth headphones) and I pause the music too long, then I can't resume playback without hitting the play button on my phone. That is to say the play button on my car or Bluetooth headphones don't do anything. The threshold for the play/pause button becoming ineffective is ~5 minutes. Seems like a software bug."
"Great work guys. You have my support with this. Here are a few things you should consider to improve experience of the user and the quality of the app. Firstly, add the duration and current play time of the media file being played in audio mode on the notification drop down of smartphones. Secondly, I should be able to put in audio mode and still have it playing as video and then switch to audio only if I use my power button. Thank you so much."
"This app worked very good until I upgraded my phone to Pixel 6,. Then one day I opened the app and all my music was gone. I have not been able to figure it out or get my music files back. Before that the app was good i did not see adds, it always resumed play back exactly where it stopped, integrated with my Bluetooth cardo packtalk com. Displayed album artwork. Now I am musicless. Very upsetting to turn on your phone and your music player is suddenly empty with no files."
"This app is one of the most buggy things I've ever had the displeasure of using. The interface is truly lacking. Deleting playlists is all but impossible if you have more than 5, because you have to tap 3 times for every single one of them, meaning if you have 50 playlists, it will take you 5 minutes of sitting there like an idiot deleting one by one. It also doesn't resume after taking a call. It just goes back to first file. You have to manually select the file you were on. Made for monkeys"
"VLC may be good for something, but it is not easy to use or intuitive. It scans my SD card music folder and will show the files there. But if I want to make a playlist it can't seem to find them even after scanning through the folders that have music in them. I don't know really what hoops it wants me to jump through."
"Good video player, worst audio player on the market. It constantly pauses songs on its own with the phone locked. It likes to alter the volume on its own too.+ skip songs in the middle and ends playlist premature.*Tried it again, it's actively worse. It's like you tried to make a music player that was a combination of a worse Windows Media Player and original iTunes. It genuinely baffles me how such a long-standing company falls so far. At least the videos actually still play. Clean up your act."
"This is a neat app that makes it easy to play MKV movie files on my tablet. Overall it works pretty well, but the casting functionality is flaky. It suddenly stopped working (the cast button disappeared), and nothing I have tried brings it back, including a full uninstall/reinstall (casting is enabled in the settings). Note that casting works fine for all other installed apps on my tablet."
"A nice, fully featured music and video player with a good equalizer and decent playback controls. Such a shame that it doesn't cope well with large amounts of music. I have about 6,000 files in total, and the app just simply doesn't detect them after a certain point, forcing me to use a more reliable app with less features, blackplayer. And yes, this happens across multiple devices I own."
"The default setting is to scan the entire phone upon startup and this setting cannot be changed at startup because VLC is scanning for media. I tried to select specific folders and have it only scan after I first updated it, but the settings did not take affect. It's a wonderful player and I'm glad it's available for so many operating systems. Keep up the good work. I'm sure this will be fixed in future versions. I'm using Android 5.1 on an older, low memory, cheap ZTE phone."
The widget does not work. Period. First off. You can use it to open the app when pressing the vlc logo but playback buttons non functional. Also it doesn't save your place or even what item you are playing in the widget. So you have to go back to the app find what you were playing and manually select it every time. It saves place on individual tracks but you need to press play on the album and skip forward to the track you want every time otherwise it will play one track and stop. This is very simple stuff that needs to be fixed ASAP. Not recommended. Unfortunate because VLC has been my go to for years on the computer.
Guys if you are looking for a music app that plays in the background try Breathe Music. it works fantastic. I plays when the phone is asleep and when I'm driving. I have all my files loaded on my phone. I select my file and then click the dots on the right to pull in the album and top the file name. It seems I have to tap the name again otherwise it won't play but the original file selected. I haven't done this a lot so maybe that was just a glitch.
"The player is constantly rescanning my library. I have 90GB of music on an SD card. Every other time I start the app it spends a ridiculous amount of time first re-scanning my library, and then re-parsing the media even though nothing has changed. m3u file support is spotty at best: it shows that my m3u files have songs in them, but when I try to open one the app just sits there scratching its butt with a ""0:00"" song on the screen and eventually crashes. The m3u files are all added to the ""Playlists"" page, but if I try to view a playlist it just shows as empty.  I think maybe the #extinf tags aren't handled correctly (or simply ignored, as any self-labeled software developer with credentials from the bottom of a box of Cracker Jacks would do when optional media tags ""aren't understood"").  Aside from that, the FLAC files play just fine! But I'm really looking for something with decent playlist support."
"I like a lot of things about VLC. It's versatile, has a good music shuffle & can play during calls. The UI is decent & easy on the eyes. Honestly, I'd probably give a 5 if not for one god-forsaken feature. It forgets whatever music you're playing after *1 minute* of being paused. 1 minute! It's 100% unnecessary, and it doesn't even do it to videos! When it forgets, it resets the shuffle and playback timer, fully negating a feature I find very useful. Please, if nothing else, make it a setting."
"When I stop an audio file (like a 13 hour audiobook), it will not start where it stopped. Instead, it starts back at the beginning. Meaning I have to remember the exact time I left off and then manually drag the bar to the right time. So inconvenient. There is also no forward/backward 10 or 30 control buttons."
"This app needs more low ratings due to problems with refreshing the music library. Everytime you add mp3 files to your device, you must uninstall VLC then reinstall it for your media files to show in the library. The refresh function doesn't work and hasn't worked in the year that I've been using VLC for android. It simply shows a bar at the bottom of the screen that says ""parsing media"", and when it is complete, you will find that your music has not been added. Still better than Google play tho."
"No real problems with playback. Importing albums from itunes on my pc to my phone works great. However, the phone app's own playlist system is entirely unusable. I had to google around to figure out how to reorder tracks, adding tracks is time consuming (have to add them one by one, instead of say adding a whole folder at once), and duplicate tracks will randomly get added to the playlist, which can't be deleted without also deleting all other copies. Also, it is impossible to import a playlist file from pc, even after correcting file paths. Overall, works fine if you don't intend on adding any custom playlists."
"I've been using this on android for almost a couple years and have finally given up on it. The dealbreaker is the sound is too quiet. At max volume in a quiet room I sometimes still can't understand what characters are saying. The 200% volume setting does nothing on my tablet. Volume booster apps stopped working with vlc. Other apps are loud and clear.   Another very annoying bit is the app gives priority to a file's Title tag, not the file name itself, and to change a Title tag on an mkv file requires spending a couple minutes per video stripping the tag on the computer. It's doable, but a very irritating hassle.   I've switched over to mx player and neither of these things are issues. Mx player is really very great for me so far."
"I use this app primarily for listening to Ogg Vorbis encoded audiobook CDs from the library. It really frustrates me that the player can't keep queue state between sessions. For example, if I only listen to 8 of 14 tracks in my queue, the next time I pull up the app, I have to rebuild the queue, and figure out myself where I left off. It gets old quickly."
"When it wants to work its great. But more often than not the app will pause the video and the audio will still play or vice versa. I've tried being a bit patient with this app, but it isnt a fun time when i get home from work, wanna watch some shows on my laptop, and every other video wont play correctly. Tried clearing cache and resetting and got zip for results."
"VLC is my favorite desktop player but using the version here for Android is like walking on eggshells. Crashes and burns when playing all of the time on Android 8.1.0, disabling functionality of everything else while it is frozen. Not worth it. The two stars I am giving it are because it is still versatile when not crashed and if it works for you, great. Too much hassle for me. Hope they improve it."
"Love VLC for PC, so had to have on my tablet. It worked great until tonight, when for no reason I could discover, it started to freeze the video, but not the sound, when trying to navigate by the progress bar. It steps from chapter to chapter fine, but trying to move within the chapter the screen freezes but audio continues. So I uninstalled, then reinstalled, hoping that would fix the problem. It didn't. I also tried a different movie. Same issue. Please fix."
"VLC has such a strong history as an amazing media player and nonprofit, and I've used it for over a decade and will continue to use it. BUT recently it's had an error where it cannot resume audio files and just seems to shut down and completely forget its place when I try to resume saying, ""multiple media cannot be played."" So if I'm listening to a 14 hour audiobook and have to stop to have a conversation then in order to start it up again I have to try to find my exact place in all of that."
"Returning to your video after having it play in the background turns it into an audio track and you have to hit a button to restore the video, which is blacked out until you scrub around a bit and then the video bugs out before returning to normal. The PiP has a chance of forcing you to restart. You can only use the notifications shade and nav buttons. Sometimes it doesn't show a folder of videos. It's a bit of a mess."
"VLC used to be great, but now it's just so-so. VLC often stops playing for no apparent reason. VLC can create playlists, but cannot add files to playlists. VLC does not appear in recent apps sometimes while it is playing files. VLC does not show recently played files in History. Cannot figure out how to delete files from History. In short, VLC has become a real pain to use. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, but problems remain, so I'm looking for an alternative media player."
"VLC was fine until around March of 2021, when my Moto G Power updated. Now VLC won't load any music from my SD card, only the stuff on my device. I've checked several times to see if it scans my SD card, and it claims it does, but it never shows up. Then recently, now it only shows music from the Download folder on my device, nothing from the Music folder. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling many times, but the problem remains unfixed. Rarely, my entire library loads, but disappears quickly"
"For actually playing music/video, it works fine. The trouble starts with playlists, they are so janky it makes listening to downloaded songs in order an absolute chore. EDIT 12/6/19: The playlists are better from when I first started, but now the app keeps crashing when it does a scan that I did not request, and it keeps happening at startup even when I disabled it. Literally unusable and a complete mockery of the desktop VLC"
"While there are a lot of good things going for vlc as a media player, I can't stand the fact that my audio samples keep getting chopped off at the end during playback. I cut audio for a podcast, and this is not only an unacceptable feature, they haven't fixed this issue in over 10 years. Thankfully I have other media players to use as an alternative."
"Increasingly disappointed. They ""fixed"" the Chromecast issues (meaning it actually connects now) but it's constantly disconnecting during playback, randomly rewinding, video will start from the beginning if I go back into the app, etc. Most recently, the audio was playing out of sync with the video and I decided I was done for now. It's a shame because VLC has always been my go-to for desktop media playback, but the Android version needs some serious improvement. Better off with XPlayer for now"
"VLC Android != VLC Desktop. It's an unfortunate thing the programs share the brand quality distinction of the desktop app.. The mobile app is unstable, frustratingly buggy, prone to dropping streams. Honestly it feels like a roll of the dice when I fast forward, or change playback speed, or pause to return to the video after a quick task, as to whether the app is going to drop the stream entirely or actually do what I directed it to do. And that's for video... Audio streaming is worse!"
The video changes after pausing and switching apps or screen timeout. It will pick up a completely different video in my folder or playlist at the same timestamp where the original one that was playing was paused. This did not occur until the most recent update and I can't seem to figure out how to fix it. Sometime while playing a video only playlist it switches to audio only. To get the option to switch back to video I have to turn off and on my screen to get the setting to populate.
"It serves its purpose as a music player, but it seems to favor certain songs on my playlist over others and never seems to play them all if I'm on shuffle, which I am 98% of the time. On top of that, every song that is played will noticably drop in pitch a second or two after it starts, sit in that lower distorted pitch for a couple seconds, then go back to normal. Super annoying."
"Not a great phone experience. It's too easy to lose the track you're listening to when the display mode changes. Also, trying to move the scrub bar near the ends is very difficult. +10/-10 buttons would be helpful there. Larger controls in general will be welcome. A big, controls only, no list, mode is desirable. The restart track dialog times out too fast."
"The latest update has made vlc unusable. I use it to listen to audiobooks, but now when I pause the book it crashes when I try to restart saying ""failed to play multiple audio files"" looking through the reviews they've known about this for a while and just haven't pushed out a patch. I would have left a one star, but I've used them happily for years and hope that one day they might finally patch this bug."
"Unlike its desktop counterpart, this app is counterintuitive and glitchy. For example, why do I have to play a track and then open the playlist it is under in order to rearrange its order?? The issue of doubling the songs on said list has also frustrated me to no end, as I spend more time deleting the double entries than actually listening to the music... After which the entire playlist is deleted along with the tracks, forcing me to re-populate it. I'm extremely fed up and definitely moving on."
I've loved this app for a long time but I just noticed today that it's adding artificial distortion to my videos. In other video players I don't hear the extra noise. I mean it's very noticeable to the point that it's grating on the ears. What kind of codec would do this? The computer software doesn't do this to my knowledge. It happens on all the videos. It's not my phone caused other apps play them just fine.
New version 3.5.2 is inadequate and slower to load. Can't long press the fast forward or reverse buttons to seek anymore. It is nice you can change the amount of seek time instead of having it fixed at 10 sec. Also when playing videos on A-B repeat the UI controls don't drop down until you click on the screen. Lastly In order to resume video playback in display mode from playing in the background the user now must long press the small cover icon on the lower left instead of one simple click..?!!
"In the past few weeks, the volume on VLC has become impossibly low. It still works fine for casting, but I am unable to use the app for watching/listening on my phone now. It's usually my go-to app for media, but even with the volume set at ""200%,"" it's still far more quiet than even my phone's native video player. This didn't used to be a problem, and it's such a strange one to come up, but I haven't been able to find any solutions within the settings."
"Can't pick up playing audio where it left off... if I am playing an album in the car, stop to get a coffee and come back, it complains that it cannot play the rest of the songs in its queue. Starting the same album from the beginning works fine. This has been a problem since I started trying to use the Android version. Does anyone know of an app that will simply play MP3s from my device (on Android Auto) without problems? Because I have yet to find one."
Great app. Needs tweeting. Issue 1 playing music. When playing you cannot skip forward to start wherever you want. You select play all at any place and it decides it will start at the very beginning. Issue 2. To go along with issue 1. Whenever you pause it. The app stops and you have to go back and restart and encounter issue number 1
"Unable to play full screen while keeping correct aspect ratio and no cropping. Instead offers ""best fit"", which keeps unused some areas BOTH top/bottom AND left/right. That's certainly not the best fit. The correct scaling would be to fill screen completely in one direction, and have some black bar in the other (unless video exactly matched screen aspect ratio)."
"I wanted to use this to listen to public domain audiobooks, but I ran into many issues. There were a lot of audio crackles and skips. The minimal playback controls make it hard to scrub through the audio and there's no instant rewind or fast forward buttons. It also kept losing my place in the file. Just changing the UI a bit would do a lot to accommodate the use of audiobooks. As it is it's not useful to me."
The UI is fine but it cannot handle FLAC files. The app glitches and makes the songs stutter. It's not my files because they work fine on other media players. Update: I appriciate the response from the devloper. I will keep it and try it out after the update and adjust my rating if it improves. An ETA on the update would be nice. Thanks
"Great media player and possibly one of the best on android, until recently. I use this to play FLAC's on my phone, but now I've been getting some strange stuttering at random parts of some songs. Almost half my library is affected. It's just too damn noticeable and it's ruining my listening experience. I tried other media players on my phone and pc just to be sure it wasn't the FLAC files and only VLC for android had this issue. Even Spotify had no issue playing local FLAC files."
"Works fine as a media player. However once I launch it even if not playing anything I get warnings in my battery manager that it is running in the background and using lots of battery life. ""Close all apps"" will not shut it off! There seems to be no way to close it outside of going into my phone settings and forcing it to stop. This is ridiculous."
"Great video/music player but with issues. For some reason, streaming to a TV, the subtitles quit after about 2 lines. Super duper annoying. Also for some reason it has issues working properly with Google Chrome. If those are resolved, then its still the best there is, but those issues take it down a few notches."
"VLC is a great app except for one very critical thing. Even when fully closed, it will take control from other apps (that were previously playing) of playing music over Bluetooth on an auto-reconnect of device. Also, even when fully closed, it will start playing over Bluetooth on an auto-reconnect when nothing was previously playing. Stealing control is bad enough, but starting play when didn't want any app playing is much worse. Fix this issue and 5 star rating."
"It's infuriating that this is the best app to play music actually on your phone, but it seems to be. I'm endlessly annoyed by it playing music from my pocket randomly after my phone disconnects from bluetooth devices, and it's dogshit playback system HAS NO SETTING to make songs play from the beginning, instead of wherever it left off the last time."
Was the biggest fan of VLC across all devices. Not so much anymore since the last update. The volume control is horrible on Samsung Note 10+. Trying to play music or video through car stereo system and the sound is so MUCH less then the previous version. Have to turn volume all the way up in car and still can barely hear it. Will be using another app until this issue is resolved.
"Latest versions have been a disaster for android. Bluetooth disconnects constantly, volume cannot be controlled, randomly starts playing even when the app is not open. Turns off randomly in the middle of songs. Never had issues with the older versions. No issues with similar apps on this phone. OnePlus 9. I love VLC but this is making it really hard to stay part of the team"
"As much as I've liked the app, it is extremely frustrating that everytime I go to turn my screen off to just listen to the music it will stop playing after a couple seconds and won't continue until I turn my screen back on. SUPER counter-intuitive on an app that plays music, even if it was designed primarily for video. ."
"Works to a point to play several different types of files. UI is difficult! Not obvious how to do most things I'd imagine one should be able to do. Although I'm sure the developers can make it do much they need some usability testing with folks who are not developing this. Or, failing that, some sort of help and tutorial. It's just not adequately obvious. Also failed to get it to work through my router. Not clear what ports, etc. are needed. Again, probably obvious to folks into the code"
"Some issues playing mp3 audios since the last two or three updates ( It all of a sudden stops or pauses playing the audios, making you hit the play button again to be able to continue). It does not save the segment you have already reproduced or played, to be able to continue from where you previously stopped or paused.I hope the VLC Team fix this issues."
"It works well for playing music but the only way I've found to turn it off is uninstall it. Nothing else works to shut it down. Not even ""Force stop"" in my Settings/Apps can make it quit. It's so annoying to have this music player resume music with the slightest provocation. Like pushing the call button on my Plantronics headset resumes music even after supposedly forcing a stop. Or I leave an earbud dangling on a tether only to find the thing has resumed playing music and is wasting my battery. Also very inconvenient having to reinstall the player whenever I want to listen to my music but uninstall/reinstall seems to be the only way to control this thing."
"Seek track is impossible to use. Whether I hold the fast forward or rewind button, tap the progress bar, drag the dot on the progress bar, or input seek time manually, nothing works. The behavior is erratic. This app is impossible to use for listening to audiobooks. 8 hours in one sitting with no breaks isn't reasonable, but required for this app to function. I've spent less time listening and more time seeking the spot I left off at. Awful!"
"I listen to audiobooks in the car and the app worked great for some time. Recently its struggling to remember where it left off and I always get the message ""multiple media cannot be played"". I have closed all apps, restarted the phone and the issue continues."
"Every time I update this app, it gets less reliable, less useful, & more frustrating to use. And I keep updating it, hoping the next patch will fix previous patch issues - but it never does, it just keeps getting worse. Plex compatibility has gone from 100% to 30% to 0%. At first it was laggy and crashy, now I can't even see my server anymore. Music player is broken. Playlists are broken. App doesn't understand playback commands from my headset. This VLC doesn't hold a candle to desktop VLC."
"What is an otherwise perfect, simple, and add free video app is ruined by a frustating playback interface. Why am I having to fight the app to get the playback controls to show up? It's wanting to hide in a drawer like slide control that is hard to open. I don't mind just tapping on the screen and the controls just appear. Fancy interfaces like this are unnecessary."
This would easily be a five star app if not for the issues that have surfaced ever since the recent UI updates on most phones. Now it drops everytime the screen goes off. So unless you want your display screen on in company with this app both burning your battery simply to listen to your audio then you are better off with almost anything else. Sad being this was my favorite for years! Would come back if yhey could resolve current problems.
"Loved the desktop version, installed on my phone - not a perfect app but it's open source, simple, & not trying to trick me into buying anything & thus is already better than most mobile apps out there. It worked for years. Now all of a sudden it can't find any of my audio files... I don't know how to fix this. I liked this app because it was simple & easy :/"
"This was a very good media player. Was. As a video player it's great for playing those files with weird extensions when no other video players will. However the folder structure is terrible. VLC just shows all the folders in the memory. Example - TV>show A>Season 1. It shows all the season folders for every TV show instead of actually using a folder tree, so you're not always sure which show that season folder is for. I ended up downloading MX Player because it works like VLC should."
This app has been out over a decade and it still cannot resume playing a video after the screen sleeps. If a video is paused for a few minutes the app crashes when the play button is hit. I reported this problem 11 years ago and it's still a problem... It also does not sacmve the location in the video where i left off when i leave a play session. Fix this lack of basic functionality already. 8-27-2022 trying to play a media file selects a random media file on the device and plays that instead
"Ever since getting my new Galaxy Tab I thought VLC would've been the perfect media player like it was for my Galaxy Note 8, but it seems like this version is just a bastardized version of what it once was. No longer can I adjust subtitle and audio delays and trying to play content that requires adjusting isn't worth suffering through on here. I'm not sure when they removed it, but I never updated VLC on my phone (version 3.0.13) and I'm glad I never did. Too bad I can't say the same for my Tab."
"Recent update broken in several ways, but I think that's the Android OS at fault for changing their layouts, menus, pop-up bars. If my phone sleeps while paused or stabbed out, playback resumes with no sound, requiring a restart, and the position is not saved. This problem is since the update a week ago. Please fix. I'll give it back to your old 5 stars."
Saves my playback history even though the setting is off. Resumes my videos and music at the point they were skipped at or when the app is closed despite that setting being disabled as well. Makes for a lousy experience especially when my hands are full or wet. The random play function seems to prefer to play the songs that I skip the most.
"Long time lover of VLC, still opens many different file types, however this app particularly has many bugs/glitches. Using pixel 3XL, functions opening files via ""Open with"" only. Once playing, the play/pause button no longer functions (older versions did work), there's also no way to kill the process on demand, I have to restart my phone to turn it off. It seems like ever since I updated the app trying to improve the open with discrepancy, it got worse. Please fix! :)"
"The app doesn't want to display any of my songs or videos properly anymore. Every time I log on to the app it un-groups all of my videos and wipes my playlists clean. Every time I try and add songs to a playlist, the app crashes and the playlists get wiped clean except for four songs. The app was working perfectly before the most recent update so I don't know what happened."
"VLC for Android will not play webradio streams with my Chromecast Audio renderer. It appears to connect. It even displays the artist and song title. No music. Sometimes there's a message saying the stream ""cannot be played"". But when I disconnect the Chromecast Audio device the stream plays on my phone. I understand that Google has discontinued Chromecast Audio but Spotify and every other app I've downloaded work with it with no problem. Not up to the standard of VLC for Windows by a long shot."
"Love the pc version, and this is a good player for free, but the interface is really not intuitive. I will probably stop using it because I can't fast forward, items I'm playing disappear from the interface and other frustrations. I'm really surprised how difficult it is to use"
"This used to be the best media player available, I've used it on Android, Linux and Windows. Sadly the latest Android version continually forgets my preferences and says I have no media to play. Resetting the preference means it parses the media for a half-hour. It also is poor at designating album divisions, and dumps downloaded albums in ""unknown,"" when other players pick it up and separate them out. I'm very disappointed, as it's become an unwieldy chore to use."
"I've been using this for audio files for some time. But with this latest update the user interface had changed considerably and it's much harder to find files. And I can no longer have my music in directory view. I'm dumping VLC for something else. Maybe MX Player. Edit: I found an older version on an app repository that is exactly the way I want it. Unfortunately, this means I can no longer update the app. Oh well."
"The Playlist experience is broken. If I change a Playlist, it doesn't auto-save like Microsoft Groove did. So I have to save the Playlist again. Except when I save over the existing Playlist, it appends the tracks to the existing Playlist instead of replacing the original list. So I have a playksit of 653 tracks because of that. That's not good software design. Just make Playlists automatically save if you remove tracks from them, or have saving work like everywhere else in software& overwrite"
"Recent updates have brought serious problems: will rescan / parse device library nearly every time the app is launched or tabbed back into, even when this function is disabled in options. As well, proper filenames are not displayed, and some files just don't show up in directories at all, such as certain mp3 or m4a files that show in other apps. Also, didn't this app used to have a widget?"
"It's amazingly difficult to figure out the interface. I enabled ""audio only"" for videos, now I can't figure out how to get video back. Shuffling videos means I have to Play All from the first video, then visually *deselect* Shuffle from the menu, of which there's like five menu dropdowns available. You can double the volume of videos, but seemingly not when in audio mode. Half your actions seem to result in starting over from the first episode."
"BUGS The slider option on the screen (not on the player controls) doesn't work properly, everytime it resets and plays the video from start when ever slide finger across. Double tap to move forward or backward by 10 seconds doesn't work and it will reset and start the video from beginning too. The duration count of the video is not correct. Video is of 20 minutes and it shows like a total of many hours in the controls and the current video duration is displayed wrong too"
"Update to 3.5.2 on Nvidia Shield. Old version was a great app for viewing .iso video files but looks like the new version has quit playing .iso files. Also it decided to mix in some files from the music folder for display purposes, ( files never moved). I'm still researching this problem but will probably try to reload an older version to fix problem."
"MAKE VLC PLAYER GREAT AGAIN!!! this used to be the very best media player, free or paid! I don't know what happened recently but within the last 6 months or so this app just isn't working right. GUI is REALLY retarded looking now. a bunch of the settings options are gone. randomly cuts out while playing, often. dark mode seems to be gone as well. I wish the devs would've left good enough alone! if it's not broke don't fix it! Re - release the original working version please and thank you."
"Interface is great, however audio becomes out of sync with video on every playback. Not sure if it's the video that lags or the audio is sped up, but the audio gets ahead of the video after only a couple seconds o playback. This is the only issue with the app, however it's a big one and makes the app pretty unusable"
"This is a great video player BUT it's definitely missing some very basic functions, like the ability to resize the video to any size on screen that you want, not just your preset original/fullscreen sizes. Also, you can't even sort your videos by date?! There are no other sorting options except by name or by size. Come on, thats ridiculous."
"I love VLC and always have for watching movies on my phone, but the fact that there is no way to use Chromecast with subtitles makes it so I barely use this anymore. I have Hard of Hearing family members that need subtitles in order to watch on the TV, and it's incredibly frustrating to cast my entire phone as it's so slow. I understand that this is an issue with how casting works in general.... but it makes VLC almost useless for me right now."
"Previous to the June 2019 update, I had no problems and would have given this app a 5 star rating. Since the update, some of my camera movies that ran flawlessly on the previous version, now have audio problems that I can't find any way to correct!! The audio sounds like (uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh) etc, you get the picture! I want to ""Thank "" the creators of this app and hope that they can correct this problem? I have a Samsung S7 android phone."
"VLC was my go-to audio player. It was easy to use & decently organized. However, something changed in an update from late July/early August, & now I can't find downloaded audios or if they download, they appear in Unknown Artists (they used to show under their own names), which makes them challenging & frustrating to find. I think it's time to find a new player... :("
"App runs constantly in the background and has a notification that is blank other than the word loading. Can not get rid of it without forcing the app closed, but it just pops back up after a bit. Guess I'll find a different player, I don't need the app running constantly in the background."
"I used to LOVE VLC until I got this new version on Galaxy S10+. I send it to Chromecast, it stops playing once the screen timeout kicks in (I have mine set for 1 min). Even the audio stops with the timeout. The menu settings are sooooooo buried it is difficult to find. This was such an amazing app/player. It is not keeping settings and loading playlists that are definitely there takes FOREVER to load up if the lists are found at all. And the text in menu screens? Light gray on light gray? WTH?"
"Has the ability to adjust playback speed been removed? I cannot find where to change it, though other reviews say this is a feature. If this feature exists I will return and upgrade my rating. There is also a checkbox about preserving playback speed. Very confusing and frustrating. Thanks."
"I've been using this App for a long time, and prior to that I have been using various Windows versions/updates for a whole mess of years (since 2003 I think). I uninstalled bc out of nowhere the app started to auto-open upon start-up, and the only way to close it was to go through my settings and force stop it. Super annoying...bye forever VLC."
"The UI is so buggy- it doesn't refresh properly when new videos are discovered. Whenever I add a new video to my phone, I have to open VLC, let it process the discovery (but the new video won't display after discovery is complete)- then I have to shut down VLC and restart it- THEN the new video is displayed. It's been like this ever since the UI was redesigned. Similarly, when I delete videos, the UI gets WAYYYY bugged out. It's the most unstable UI I've ever seen in a video player app."
"2 stars. Something happened update wise (likely Android Vrsn 11) where after about 20 seconds of a song playing VLC just stops. VLC on PC I've been using for years since it plays anything no issues. But for this phone app it's broken for me now. Via Bluetooth in my car no issues, but not on phone itself.. Please check into this VLC developers I'd love to have my old faithful back... Old= 11/2019 Has never failed. It's the only one I've been using for quite some time. Try it you'll like it."
"VLC for Android just isn't up to the standards of its PC counterpart. No matter what android device Ive used, I always run into some sort of hindrance when playing videos. Sound cutting out and not reappearing until I exit, video cutting out or distorting, etc etc. It finds a way to ruin anything I watch. Unfortunately VLC is the only half decent app to support some of the less common video formats so you're forced to deal with its many shortcomings."
"The app works well, except it refuses to display certain album art and doesn't have an option to allow me to set it manually in-app (and even changing album art in other apps does absolutely nothing, even after deleting cache or reinstalling the app). Please add this feature and I'll rate 5 stars. It's a really annoying flaw on an otherwise excellent app."
"Starts the last song at full volume at random times, fortunately pretty rarely but it's still annoying enough to make me consider uninstalling (Im a librarian, you can imagine when it happens at work). I can't find where to deactivate the lock screen widget, which seems to be the culprit. Other than that, great app, thanks a lot."
"VLC has been my go to video player for a while, however now trying to use it on my S23+ video starts playing at a lower frame rate after about a minute. I think its due to the adaptive refresh the phone has, but vlc doesnt seem to stop it from trying to lower the refresh rate after a period of time, interacting or touching the screen fixes it but then it does it again pretty soon after. I cannot find any settings that may help. This doesn't happen in the samsung default video player."
"VLC is a good music-video app, undoubtedly. However, for some of us that place a high regard on song organisation, it doesn't meet standards at some points. VLC disorders the original way I've saved my songs and just renames them entirely, making it difficult to even search for some of my downloaded music. Please, rectify. Thank you."
Writing on an Android. Something as simple as moving subtitle position on Mac. You would think it's easy... Or doable. Worse than a root canal. My cats will lay in front of television and block the subtitle area. All I needed was to shift them up. Answers are nowhere and fiddling with interface and codecs is not something i want to bother with. Jitters with 4k. Not sure why. Abandoned and found another app that does it effortlessly in the main menu and doesn't pixelate with 4k. 2.5 stars.
"I used vlc on my pc, no issues, but tablet has BAD audio issues. *Update*Reply from VLC was correct, though a bit confusing. I found an Audio Delay option. Need to test it to be sure delays are fixed. ""Stars"" Updated accordingly. UPDATE2: Tried their fix..same issue. VLC seems to have an issue on my tablet, even *.avi files. UPDATE4:On tablet the audio is always badly desynced. I change audio sync options, then it desyncs again. Change delay again, desyncs again. Tried many vid files,same issue"
Sync issues between audio and video. Hevc 265 file on pixel 7 pro and it's ever so slightly out of sync. Milliseconds. But enough to notice and take away the enjoyment of the movie. Installed xplayer to validate it not the file. Everything in sync on xplayer
Love the app for the most part. I started brand new a week or so ago and I'm already making good progress. The problem I'm having is that the music scrolling across the screen randomly lags. It makes me miss notes and sends me into practice mode. It is extremely annoying! I've emailed their support multiple times and have yet to get a response. It was so close to being a good app... very disappointing.
"Just started with a rhythm lesson and was very annoyed. In the exercises with no background music, if there are two of the same note in a row, I will strike it once and it counts for two notes, no matter how briefly I hit it, even if they're supposed to be half notes. And then for the ones where I'm playing along with music, I keep getting this ""unable to hear your piano"" alert before the notes even start, and then it lowers the volume of the song so I can't hear it to get a feel for the tempo."
"Terrible sound recognition. This gets me everytime. The lesson froze once and I had to RESTART my whole progress. It's very annoying. I also wish they gave us opportunities to actually pick a song we actually LIKE to play. Overall, their lessons are okay but whenever it goes to practice mode, it's very slow and sometimes I didn't even make a mistake and it goes into practice mode right off the bat!"
"I do like the lessons. I've got both an electric grand as well as an acoustic piano. The app cannot hear either of the pianos well enough for me to play with any music. Also, the app has a hard time hearing chords. I'll have to hit the chords multiple times for it to register or hit each note in the chord seperate for it to clear. The app is alright, just think that this shouldn't be a problem after paying $149 for it. Obviously this didn't happened during the free trial."
"I want to love this app. I practice almost everyday with this app or another one. Honestly, this one is infuriating. It recognizes single notes & chords pretty well when just practicing/learning those. However, when you try to play along with a song the whole thing falls apart. I use both a digital keyboard & a stand up piano. Doesn't matter. The app has extreme difficulty hearing a chord. Don't get me started on the worthless metronome. Think I can handle 4/4 time, but not according to this app"
"This app is beyond terrible at hearing the notes. It constantly shows that you missed a note when you clearly didn't, and it's extremely frustrating when you're trying to learn how to play but you can't because it keeps you stuck on one note that it refuses to listen too. When it doesnt have this issue though, the app is wonderful to use and is a great way to learn how to play the piano, the only thing bringing it down is its inability to hear the notes at times."
"It's a good app and a good to learn. But it sucks at recognizing the chords. I have to bang on my piano and hold the headset microphone really close for it to recognize anything. I reached out to them and informed them about this issue, only to be told to use a headset instead of my phones speakers. If you're thinking about using your phones speakers.... well.... I wish you good luck."
"As an amateur musician and beginner to the piano, I can't in good faith recommend this to anyone trying to music. First off, the metronome for practice mode is slower than the actual song, which is completely asinine. Second off, It almost seems as if you have to play slower than, or at least off beat to, the actual song. I'm sorry if I come off as harsh, but this is the most legitimately angry I've ever been with an app."
The free portion is extremely basic. Everything else is behind a paywall. Also when you play along the pickup of the notes is delayed from the app so you end up having to play out of time in order to get check marks correct. if you play in advance to keep up with the music you get dinged. there's a delay between the processing of the app and picking up the sound in the actual readout which can be a bit frustrating.
"Constant listening issues. Not so bad early on (though annoying), but im trying to do the Entertainer and it keeps dropping notes that I know are correct and in time, like the D that opens the rhythm of the first section of part A, or the E and G that make the 1 and 3 in the back of that same section. The app has good resources but this has become quite frustrating."
"Developer responded claiming the fixes had come out with the latest update, but this update was released a week before I downloaded the app. Nothing has been fixed for either device I have tried to use.. (Note 10+ and Tab S6). Midi still is not recognized when switching between lessons causing you to have to entirely close and reopen the app each time. Lags constantly during songs causing notes to be missed. Absolutely amazing though for the content and learning ease of the app."
"It works but it's super annoying if you know how to play. I wanted to explore the rest of their songs cause I was considering using this to teach but na. The interface won't let you access songs quickly. You have to do the tutorials which are great for beginners, very frustrating if you already have some piano skills."
"This has the potential to be a great learning app, however some tweaks need to be made. I have made suggestions about being able to scroll back through the parts where you've made mistakes and not replay the whole thing. It also needs an initial slow tempo when learning. You can't learn if it is rushed. I get frustrated and just end up closing it. I really want to love it but it's so cumbersome it does not make playing the piano enjoyable. The only reason I like it is because of the Play Beta."
"You guys should have song selections to practice with. (I mean for the default) For example in the Essentials I course, I'm not interested in playing Timber. If there were other selections, I'd love learning with app. I'm not interested in pop songs at all but rather classical. Someone else might be interested in pop songs."
"Not at all what I expected. I've been playing for 40 years, but my youngest child wanted to learn from an app. Thank goodness for the free trial - after a few days she became frustrated & was no longer interested. The program moves too quickly and the timing on the music is too fast for little hands. It's completely different than playing/learning by actual sheet music. We'll stick to good old fashion practice books. Simply Piano simply isn't for us."
"At the beginning when you first open the app, it asks whether you are just starting piano, learned as a child, or have experience. I have experience with piano, so I clicked the third option. But then it doesn't advance you farther into the course, or have you take a quiz to estimate where your level is. Why ask the question then? Could this be an option? I have learned the basics and more about piano, and it was very boring to have to go over simple notes and rhythms again. Uninstalled."
"Not impressed. This sounded like a good idea and unfortunately I paid the $45 for a 1 year subscription. I didn't decide to cancel until just after the free 7-day trial passed. My concerns have been expressed by others, first being that you can't slow down the music to learn to play it properly before playing at the programmed tempo. Another frustration is how the app frequently claims the wrong key was hit. This app may work for some, but I strongly recommend you give it a good try before paying."
"This is seriously starting to get on my nerves. One, I already know the simple cords and I can play a song or two fine. What's getting on my nerves is that I still have to go throuhh the tutorial. And two, I'm sitting there practicing placing a song and they're like ""lowering volume to help you hear better"" Yeah well, when you lower the sound I can't hear anything over my keyboard (which is on the lowest setting) and so I get a note wrong and then I half to restart. So annoyed."
"I feel the commercials are misleading. The ads on this app make it seem as if this gives you many songs and courses for FREE. But I have to say, I was a disappointed to see the only thing you can really do in this app is the first course and then you have to pay for the rest. And I finished the course in 5 minutes? I now have no use for this app. Developer, why not add a couple free courses and songs? Like, 50 or something. It'd help artists with less money who want to learn piano. Thanks."
"At first when I thought it was free, I got so excited and I loved learn the first five notes. Here I went wanting to a musician, but NO. This app talks about wanting to help viewers play piano, but then after you get past the first five notes, it requires you to pay a fee! What the heck! This app is good if you want to pay to learn an instrument. :("
"this app really has its pros and cons . At first i was quite excited to buy the essentials pack but then after that it did not turn out well .i sometimes had to bang very hard on the piano in order for the app to hear and could you give us more practice chances ?And please adjust the beater . It is soooo slow , and it is so hard to play the song ,without good practice , so please adjust the beater according to the pace of each songs . This feeback is for the better of all users of this app ."
I love the app and am willing to pay for a monthly subscription. It's at $12.49/monthly currently. When I first signed up last week its was $9.99. Either way I think the price is reasonable. But when I read the fine print I see that the entire price for the year or whatever you choose(6 months or 3 months)[which is more...I would love to get the premium but only if it was taken out on a monthly basis.
"I previously rated this 4 stars, but something has changed. My complaint, and it's an annoying one, is that the app doesn't pic up the notes you are playing properly. Sometimes it registers that you hit a key 2 or 3 times when you only hit it once. It used to register the key notes most of the time, but now it barely works. I can't use the app with the sound on because it can't hear what keys I'm pressing. Overall good for learning the keys"
"After you learn the basics (which I could have learned the 5 fingers from a quick Google search) there really isn't a thing to do until you get premium. I also hated all the singing and the app's noises, very distracting and infuriating to hear after you get a note wrong. Very easy app to use if you have patience. App is definitely made for children rather than adults."
"I really enjoy this app, but recently it's been having trouble reading the notes which was pretty annoying. After not being able to put up with that problem anymore I decided to get the MIDI cable, works perfectly now it reads all the notes but now the problem I'm having is that there is SOOOO much lag and it sometimes even crashes the app because it lags so much😭 cant even an entire song without it lagging or crashing"
"My experience was bad, first of all they have ads everywhere like YouTube that market the app as free, even though you only get about 6 lessons free. Second of all, the teaching was too robotic, you should let the person choose between classical and pop and what they want to work on. If they want to work on scales, then they should he able too. Instead of being forced to do certain songs in a lesson."
"This app would honestly get five stars from me if was either (A) actually able to consistently recognize chords or (B) not a subscription service. Alas, neither of those boxes are checked; a lot of times I will have to either roll or slam down a simple C chord for the app to recognize the notes, and even then it still might not register forcing you to redo entire segments again and again, bringing down what would otherwise be a useful learning tool."
"App is very rigid on what it allows you to do. Lesson beginnings are overly simple and repetitive, but will end much more challenging compared to the rest of the lesson and lack a medium step between between overly easy and abruptly challenging. When you mess up(or the program registers too many wrong not(true or not)) It then forces you to go back, at which point the prior parts of the lesson are too simple. I would not recommend this app and feel disheartened that I spent $150 dollars on it."
"The note detection didn't work well on my piano. I was hitting the notes it was telling me to, but would often detect two in a row when I pressed a key once or miss one entirely and then tell me I failed. I turned my piano's volume up to max, but it didn't make a difference. It automatically lowers the volume of the music in the app to the point where you can barely hear it at all in order to ""hear you better"" but that didn't help it get more accurate, it just made playing less fun."
"Update: down to 2 stars. Not being able to play through custom measures of a song is super frustrating still. Just drag back and forth. My media player can do it. This is a good program. I did experience it trying to listen to the correct notes but I went all USB and fixed that issue. My reason for 3 stars is I can't practice a single measure or redo sections in the learning sections. When I'm messing up at the end of the song, I don't want to have to play everything before it to practice."
"Seems ok, but want sheet music & accompaniment? It's the ""premium-special-members-subscription-club-$$$"" locked down routine. Learn basics/scales? Seems fine - the ""create a profile"" looked like it wanted to pair to a keyboard if yours has Bluetooth, but again if all you want is sheet music & accompaniment to learn a song/songs, nope. Oh, & the ""subscribe"" buttons are placed directly under the ""back"" button, which creates mis-taps that go to the subscribe page over & over. I hate that so much."
"I have had both positive and negative experiences with this app. My frustration is through the roof right now. It is TERRIBLE at recognizing chords. It can't recognize the C bass on my left hand while the C major chord on my right hand plays simultaneously. The further I get into the app, the more notes and chords it doesn't recognize. I end up mashing the keys or playing neighboring keys to try to get it to understand which key I'm playing. My keyboard doesn't have MIDI/USB connections."
"Changing to 2 star. I bought a 1yr subscription and honestly wish I hadn't. I have 2 main reasons: 1)the app doesn't pick up on certain keys and its makes practice difficult. 2) it doesn't teach you everything you need to know. I bought the book ""alfred's all in one"" for piano to fill in the blanks and twenty minutes with the book taught me everything I learned on this app and more in over a month.I paid $11 for the book and over $100 for this. Not worth the price and is stressful to learn on."
"At first everything was very easy to use, but after learning only five notes and the absolute basics, you would have to buy the premium membership to learn anything else. I'm sure the premium is worth it and just as organized if one is willing to pay and has the time to play piano. It is just a little upsetting how you have to pay every month for learning something when it originally seemed free but doesn't offer much for those who don't want to pay for something like this."
"The app used to be great. Lately, I have found there are too many glitches, both Android and Apple based software. I also find the Facebook group super annoying and useless. The admins there... Even more annoying . I will not be renewing my subscription and I encourage you to find another piano learning app. There are many out there with better functionality."
"This app is definitely not suited for little kids. It lacks speed adjustment to allow people to really learn. It also does not save intermediate within level progress, so one has to restart every time they turn-off the program. This makes it frustrating for kids. I also wonder what drives song choices?"
The app is good with helping you learn. I don't want a trial premium i just don't know why the only thing you can access is beginner level. The app told me the volume wasnt loud enough so i turned my piano the the loudest setting but it was still not loud enough. I turned my volume on the app all the way down and it still wasn't working. If i wanted to do another thing on the piano it was on screen and i want to do it on my own. Premium is to expensive and i cant afford it.
Not a good way to learn piano. It is a little helpful for supplemental learning. It would be nice to be able to separately toggle the volume of the annoying metronome. I think repetition is a better way to learn new pieces of music rather than forcing students to play a piece very rapidly.
"This app would be great for people who want to learn how to play piano, but for people who are advanced on the piano and have been playing for a while, this app is not good. I have been playing piano for a while and I wanted this app just for the purpose of getting free fun sheet music, but there is no option asking for your level of play above I learned as a child or some experience. Overall the app is pretty cool, but you can't skip to advance levels if there are any from the really easy stuff"
"I enjoy this app- when it works, which it generally doesn't. The app either hears my piano and registers too many notes played- for instance I'll play one note and it will quickly mark off three notes on the app- or it doesn't hear my piano at all (no matter the volume or proximity to the speakers) and sends me into practice mode. Once in practice mode, the app crashes. Will be uninstalling."
"This app is not great for non-beginners. I am an intermediate piano student and was hoping to learn pop songs and jazz chords. This is not part of the free trial, so I paid. But it tells me I first have to complete ""essentials 3"" which is really long and tedious, teaching me things like the C major scale and dotted quarter notes. This is well below my level and a waste of my time. There really should be a way to quiz out of this."
"First lessson is free, the others are subscription-based. This was inadequately explained. System lags slightly at each note, possibly my tablet (Samsung Tab 3.) Unclear as to the difference between ""practice mode"" and nonpractice mode. Instructions are clear. Friendly UI: colorful, behaves as expected. I did learn, but tools are not (personally) worth set value. That being said, the app is cheaper than hiring a tutor."
"I wanted to like this app but it's impossible for me to use. The app doesn't pick up my piano no matter what I do, where I put my phone, volume levels, none of it helped. I played middle c about 12 times and it kept saying I was playing D or E an octave below. Very frustrated that it doesn't work. I will say that the instructions are very clear. So 2 stars I suppose. Edit: I tried every tip it gave me before I wrote my review and it still didn't work :("
"I have expirience in playing and I want this app so I can play over the summer and get better for next year. But, the app makes you have to pay to access all the content past intro which is really frustrating. My friend has the app and the membership, but I didn't know about the membership when I saw him use it and it looked like a nice app I'd like. And the adds about it help in making you think that it's an app to make everyone who's wanted to play piano an amazing player ALL FOR FREE. False."
"if you are a complete beginner, this is bareable, but if not, all the songs are very linear, and if yiu mess up you have to redo that section, everything is sight-reading not actuall helping you, however it gives a few tips, but other that, this app is not worth my time. i want a refund on my 6 month plan"
"Has the potential to be a great app. Does not pick up certain notes when playing chords, Which causes frustration as the app gets harder. Already Play in a quiet environment with a headphone on and I still have issues with note recognition. I don't believe I should buy additional Components for the amount that I paid for the entire year. Almost 2 months out from previous review and still having the same issues"
"I'm not going to lie, at first I loved this app! It seemed and was the perfect piano learning app. Then it wouldn't count some notes I was playing making me redo the course. Then I had to get a darned premium thing before I could finished a single course. I will rate 2 star, but only because of the entrance (and my keyboard I use is really loud so that's not the problem here)."
"Your piano has to be pretty tuned, which pretty much eliminates anyone with an old piano, and if you're anything above beginner, it forces you to go through so many beginner courses before you can play anything near your skill level, and buy a premium account which is just a waste of money because if you're intermediate you can just print out sheet music of a song you wanna play. It may be good for beginners, idk, but if you're not, it's not worth it. From the ads to the app, it's just annoying."
"Was good, now terrible. I downloaded this first about 2 month ago and it was wonderful. I was playing every day and it was perfect. Now, I'm assuming there was an update, it doesn't recognize any of the notes I play and I can't get through any of the lessons because of it. Doesn't work even when I connect a USB cord like suggested. Please go back to the way it was before, this was a great app! It's very frustrating, especially when I paid for this."
"Practice mode is terrible, please allow people to turn it off altogether if/when they dont need it. Also, please make it so that the ""reduced volume"" message when your phone cant hear isn't blocking the top of the sheet music. Shocked that any major app would do something so ridiculous. At least put it to the far right so it's not directly blocking the notes you need to play. If you fixed these things (which c'mon, just make a checkbox in the options) I would give this a 4/5."
"The play section of the app really needs to scroll while you play and recognise when the correct note has been played. Auto-scroll isnt great when there is a tricky bit mid way though. The ""Teach me"" option also does not recognise when the correct note has been plays and carries on scrolling, with no way of scrolling backwards a bit. It's impossible to learn the songs without these functions. The songs and challenges are nice, but again missing being able to scroll back a bit."
The app is fairly okay to learn with. One huge issue is that it doesn't recognise notes when they are or aren't played. It can be quite stressful to know you're doing it right but feeling that you've done it wrong. It is a good app with a good goal but this needs to be fixed. I am still attempting to use the app but this issue ruined the experience for me
"After using the app for 2 months I have one big problem. Why I can adjust difficulty aka speed for my comfort? There are only 3 options (60, 80 and 100). But what if I want 30? And in the most practices you don't even have this feature. If not this, then why there is no possibility to turn off speed practice in general? I want to learn piano in my pace. This app is too difficult because of this thing."
Error downloading files all the time. Often it doesn't recognize that it's connected to the keyboard although it is. I have to restart the app many times to fix this. There should be a symbol showing whether it is connected or not and a button to reconnect.
It was user friendly and intuitive until someone decided to change the interface. These changes were not necessary. Give the user the option to use old interface because the app deserves 5 stars!
"App ONLY allows you to advance upon playing secular songs - some inappropriate, EVEN YOUNG CHILDREN'S SETTINGS! We want to learn to play classy music, not trashy music. Upon sign up asks for musical preference on this & Guitar (We were excited when Classical, Country & Christian were listed!), yet does not offer much if any of what you selected. It was mostly new secular. Bummed - because aside from these flaws, the program was excellent. Won't use it because of morality - for we & the kids."
"As someone who has paid for the annual subscription, I have two things I would like to see change that would make this app a 5 star for me. 1. During the moving note exercises, I would like the settings wheel to have an option to slow down the pace to varying percentages, from 10%, 20%, 30%, etc. All the way up to 100%. 2. During the moving note exercises I don't want 90s beat boxing sort of rythmes that distract me. I would much rather having a metronome sound that goes with the songs rythme"
"i did the first few lessons and i don't see how this is supposed to teach you. learning piano requires you todo some memorization, this app reminds me of guitar hero you are just playing the notes that pop up on the screen."
"It was OK. As a 12 year old, I'd say that the free first course was fun, but the fact you have to pay for the rest isn't good because the rest of the piano/keyboard type learning g apps are boring."
This game is good but it's not that good because it makes you to pay Once you finished the 1st column and then it says You get a free month of no paying and then you have to PAY and I'm not doing that so no I recond it if you want to pay money to get pano lessons but if you don't want to pay for pano lessons then I don't recommend it.
As a father testing it out for my daughter. It was a great intro. Until you see the price of the subscription after completing the 10min intro. The cost of subscription isn't anywhere close to justifiable for a none human coaching tool. The app is great. But I can't justify the cost.
"I love this app but get stuck towards the end of lessons in the song not recognising the notes anymore. Even in practice mode when it shows the right key, so I know I am pressing it - so frustrating. Would be great if it had an option to turn it off and for the app to trust that I do play the right notes."
"(review is for demo version, full version might be ok). Introductory tutorial is too easy (completed in about 5 minutes). Trial is not available for subscriptions shorter than 1 year. Free 7-day trial is a bit too short given that more sophisticated excersises are locked until simple ones are completed. There is no option to buy a subscription for 1 month, leave it alone that the price for a year is $150."
Was really excited to get started after this was recommended to me. Unfortunately it doesn't work with my android phone as it fails to 'hear' my already very loud playing on my Technics electric piano. Now finding it hard to find out how to unsubscribe from the trial - real shame!
"on the first lesson when I hit my C and D note it said it was wrong, according to them, my C is one note away and my D is on the other side of the keyboard even if my keyboard is loud as heck the app can barely hear it, I can't learn like this"
"Sometimes the notes fail to mark the right one. And the main reason for the 2 stars is that $149 is too expensive and the free version doesn't have much. I'm from a poor country, but I think that price is expensive even for other countries too. There nothing to do once you complete the first group of lessons, so it's basically useless unless you pay."
"The beginner lessons were great and helped me a lot, but everything else required you to pay monthly, and was about $20 a month."
"Expensive 🫰 The app is fine, but the suscription is very expensive. It's almost like paying a real teacher for real lessons. That why I leave 2 stars. I ended up cancelling."
"Oh simply piano, we could cheat your systems by 2 options 1 is that you could speak and copy the melody's of the key 2 is by pressing multiple notes at a time.And you have some hearing problems I pressed a key and maked the note red. While that you SIMPLY have to ruin this app cause when I press 1 key it makes it 2 keys at one time. Oh simply piano you are simply bad"
In the first few lessons it's okay the teachers you notes but after that you have to pay to learn in my opinion you paying each month $12 to learn and getting ads sometimes is really annoying
"It's good but like why do you have to stop playing when you finished your 3 notes already? Like I'm not paying for the rest of the app I just wanna, play piano and play my favorite song"
I was loving it before but then suddenly when I've completed the beginner's intro think it said that I am need to pay and I would have a 7-day free premium thing and I think that's a really bad thing because I wanted to carry on because it said that it will help me on my journey but I don't want to pay because if the app is free than the music should be free too
"The note recognition is meh, also the practice mode it has gets rather annoying quick when combined with that. Would be bearable if the app had all the lessons opened up on purchase so the user could at least skip buggy sections, or just go to lessons then practice on their own."
"This app was really good to start of with but once I finished fjs first corse it says you have access to all the other courses but when I tried to go onto the next one it said I needed premium to do it even though I'd completed the first corse. I even re did tje first corse incase I missed anything but nothing changed, this might just be a bug on my phone but I'm not sure"
Full of adds deceivingly stating $9.99 per month when actual charge that is offered is $150. There is no option to try it for a month. It forces you to pay for longer period. 7day trial is also deceptive because they still take your credit card for the trial.
First the app was working good but after I install it again and start learning but it is not hearing properly even my mobile volume is 20 percent then also . Please fix it
"It was really fun to learn Middle C, D, E, F and G. Unfortunately, after completing the basics you have to 𝙥𝙖𝙮 𝙢𝙤𝙣𝙩𝙝𝙡𝙮. True, not that bad, but it's really expensive. So, unless you have the money, just look up ""Piano Tutorial for Beginners"" on YouTube."
"I give 2 stars becouse i think that you pay too much so in my case I don't wanna pay €11.66 fo r only 6 months and then after 6 months I can't play songs any more, some parents don't have all that money, (in 6 months I won't learn not even 2 songs) any way apart that it's a very good app it makes you learn very well all the notes. I hope some of alot of people agree with me, any way bye guys 🙂🙏👱🏼‍♀️"
"It says it's free but its not, as soon as you learn cdefg and play one song (perfect by Ed Sheeran) it tells you that to continue you need to buy premium, like honestly, I could have just looked that up on YouTube and I put in that I had experience so obviously I know abcded and g, how can you play without them?! I don't like it and would not recommend."
"Good stuff but sometimes the notes, when played, do not count. Also, the time signature and beat are off when it comes to playing songs. Also out of tune."
Man sometimes even though i click the key but sometimes it doesn't work that's not the big problem but it's tooo expensive like crazy + at basics when we try the song it doesn't sound like it even not even a bit so yea I would rate this 1 and a half or 0 And even it shows intro we've helped so many children's achieve their dream though I think it's a lie so we come
"I'd say it's a pretty good app but when I started to play like sometimes i would start to play but then it just go on like I know what key to press but I don't and I'm just sitting there and I,d press random keys until I got it right. And I really wanted to learn but I didn't find this app helpful and I think the sheets with the notes on them are better in my opinion."
"It's good but the song doesn't rhyme with the piano sounds, second I want to try the 7 day trial but they want me to pay first, i expected that I'll try the free trial but this apps wants me to pay first to use the 7 day trial, it's still more better when you have a real tutor, rather than this app"
My 9 year old and I were enjoying this app. A few months into our year long subscription all our progress disappeared. We contacted simply piano and it seemed to reappear. Not sure if they did it or it was by chance. A month or two later it happened again. I sent emails through the app for support as well as the website and no one ever responded to me or helped. She was less than willing to start from the beginning to get her songs back after all that work. Super frustrated. Want my mkney back.
It is nice for beginners but when you do songs like dance monkey then they give just random notes and it doesnt even match the song
"My son is missing fingers on one hand so to ""number"" the digits rather than just teaching notes was deflating for him and all limb difference children. Shouldn't force religious based songs. After a week it won't let us log in and no option for customer support with this? Wish I hadn't had to pay for a bulk amount, now I'm stuck with this thing that doesn't work effectively, should offer one month at a time purchase."
Okay I want to learn piano without paying 183 dollars for premium and premium should t be a thing to her so you can complete more than goddam course so thanks for this garbage app moneygrab
"The first couple of chapters ( the free ones) work really nice so that customers are tempted to buy the full version. Once there, the app sometimes does not hear the right notes. This issue is more evident when you begin with cords where you really get stuck and cannot move forward so I gave up on it. Good idea but it needs a lot more development before it starts charging."
"It's fun at first and then nearly impossible to bear. There is no way to customize this. Most songs are too fast for me, and I can't skip a level, so I am just stuck. It's frustrating not to be able to either slow down a song or to turn off the forced repetition mode. This whole apps speed and settings are very discouraging. I recommended signing up for the competition insted, because even cancelling with them seems near impossible."
"This app would be great, if certain issues can be fixed. It keeps telling me it ""can't hear"" my piano,"" in the midst of rests and four-bar intros. You know, the times I shouldn't be playing - and hence, am not. It then dials my volume back so that I literally can not hear it and, thus, can not hear the beat on which to play. It also seems the app can not simultaneously recognize four pitches?"
It's definitely a very useful app and I would've given it a 5 if there were no glitches. Sometimes it doesn't pick up notes and I would keep playing it multiple times to move onto the next note. It doesn't budge and then it just stays there. I tried restarting the app but still it continues to freeze. Please try to resolve this glitch if you can. Otherwise the app is great. Thanks!
"The courses seem great or at least it seems so from the first free course. But anything after that and you MUST pay an expensive subscription. Hell no, I am not going to, Damn it, there aren't even a little bit more free courses, just a stupid ridiculously easy first one just to let you evaluate the app and then either you pay you if you don't give us your money you can go screw yourself. I wish there was an ad system instead maybe 2 watch an ad every so often, that'd be way better truly free."
I did not like it as much because my expectations were high. I thought everything was free and that I can finally learn again but you could only learn the basics and it was too easy because I had been to classes before and even had my first exam in trinity college. But the app is great and also only if you pay money you can feel that great. Also please fix sound recognition because that is bad. Those of you reading this it is a great app if you do pay and please do install.
"Misleading - this is a paid app. Pretty annoying too, there's no way to stop it from repeatedly automatically reducing the volume to hear your piano when the song hasn't even started right to the point where you can't hear the backing track. Also no way to stop it automatically putting you in practise mode when you don't want it to. This could be a good app, but these flaws make me want to hurl my phone."
"Great app with a few nuances. Please add in the settings to remove the auto decrease volume feature, if I miss just a note or two due to human error it reduces the volume even though it's picking up notes perfectly. Not only is it annoying but the notification itself is extremely distracting! Other than that it's the best app, but it's so frustrating it's kind of a deal breaker. Please fix and I will give 5 stars and consider a subscription."
"So disappointed. I started off LOVING this app. During the current lockdown I decided to learn how to play my sister's piano. The starting of this app was amazing, and I started getting the hang of how to read sheet music (5 notes) faster than I though. even ended up paying for the year. But I will now cancel. The app sometimes randomly thinks you're playing notes you're not playing and fails you. It's such a frustrating experience and has been an absolute deal breaker. Hope it gets fixed."
"Overall, still a very good app- but it would be really appreciated it if they could bring the functionality of the android version up to the level of the iOS version , to ensure that the learning experience is equal. Initially I was very excited by this app, and have found it very enjoyable. However, there are some basic functions missing in the Android version which have been available in the iOS version for years. A key problem is that in the Android version there is no grading or feedback on timing at all (unlike the iOS version), which is a problem, as you are not getting as good a piano learning experience as on iOS- and you're only getting feedback on whether you played a note or not. This is a problem for me, as I won't be moving onto the iOS platform- but the functionality of the Android version is not quite as good. Joytunes- lease put the effort into bring the functionality further."
"Not the best choice for children. Basically, very good for learning piano. But children easily discouraged. The sounds created for indicating that the keys were not played correctly are not explained. A child needs to be very determined not to be put off by the sudden interruptions that don't make clear what went wrong. There seems to be a bug too. When keys were pressed too quickly, the whole app seems to freeze and there is no way to continue for several seconds. Most annoying."
"The app is visually appealing and easy to navigate. The free version only has access to 5 stages in 1 section, some are videos. In order to get to the rest you have to pay for a 3/6/12 month membership, for which they want £60 for 3 months or £120 for 12 months. I uninstalled it because it wasn't apparent nor clear prior to download and registration that large fees were required in order to use the app beyond the 'get started' section."
"could be fantastic, I would purchase this app if the price point was more reasonable. I think you'd find a lot of people would take you up your subscription if it were priced correctly, far too expensive. Not only that, you don't give and option for purchasing a subscription on a month to month basis, I for one would buy a months subscription to at least properly road test it. I think you need to reconsider your costs, not everyone can afford 89 dollars upfront."
"I used to love this app so easy to sync and play music. Now, since the recent updates, it will stop mid-song and will not play any further. Restart the music, skip to the next song, and it still does it. Doesn't matter if I'm playing in the car , with headphones, downloaded/streaming. On top of the bugs in playing music continuously, it also will play songs that have been removed multiple times from a playlist. It's very disappointing for a paid app."
"Two major problems. First, artist discography has disappeare. Second, reorganizing playlists has become a chore. I can't move songs up in a fluid movement, I have to move them up a few and scroll up. Then that messes with the order and I end up spending an hour fixing the problem. It's so bad that moving three simple songs messes up a ten song streak. It's so frustrating."
"I really want to love Deezer but there are two things that keeps it from being as good as Amazon Music 1. No ability to control the quality or data usage of tracks. I'm on a limited data plan and I don't want to be wasting it at work for songs 2. No built in equalizer. This is essential as third-party apps on Android sometimes do not/can't correctly intercept audio streams. Besides that, I find music Discover features lacking but I believe they can fix that with just some GUI fixes."
"Can't sign in with my phone number, it's apparently not available in USA. Checked that my country didn't randomly change again. It didn't, but it won't perform pull down refresh. Randomly decides what to play, irregardless of the playlist I chose. I don't want AI music. No, I do not have autoplay on. Yes I cleared and reinstalled everything. This has become a facade. I'm sick of paying for it. Cancelled."
"Doesn't seem very compatible with Nest/Google Home devices. If I go to switch songs on the app it takes awhile to play again. Like right now I've been waiting for a song to start since before I started this review. I guess you can't use your phone simultaneously? Idk. My wifi network speed is at 650 mbps, which isn't the best it can run at, but definitely not slow enough to cause this much loading time. I had really hoped for a better hifi music source for my Google home speakers."
"This app started out great, but in the past 2 weeks or so it's been a let down. For some reason the same few songs are playing a lot more than any others. I even had to delete an artist from my list because they were played too frequently by the app. I thought it was clever how the app creates our flow list when we 1st start using.. I had about 30 artists, but I noticed the list was trimmed to 10. There's no option to edit it. This was the key feature that kept me using it. Uninstalled for now."
Not essesntial but they could make a feature that blends in the finishing track with the next track in your song list. I feel that they should make the option for you to download individual tracks from any album; not having for you to download your whole favorites track or the whole album. A great example of this would be the Spotify player. Thank you
"It (was) a pretty good app. In the previous update we used to be able to play music for free, you could skip whenever you want, selectly choose the exact song you wanted, and skip to a part of a song completely for free. The update that came up messed all of the features we had for free. When I played my favorite playlist, many ads for a premium came up (unlike from before) and play random songs from a artist I didn't even like IN MY FAVORITES PLAYLIST. I cant even."
"How can a simple streaming app be so bad? The app lags like CRAZY. Between that and the songs taking forever to load (even over wifi), I'll press a song and it won't play for sometimes 15-20 seconds. Once they're loaded, the songs still have to buffer all the time. When I press shuffle, it doesn't even work half of the time. I've never had these issues with any other streaming app. It's sad, because the audio quality is actually great. Giving 2 stars for that alone."
I've used this app since the end of July. I haven't had any issues with it until the past two weeks where it will switch on its own from repeating album to repeating one song. I've made sure that one song repeat is NOT selected on several occasions with playlists and albums. Some how it switches to one song repeat without me touching it. I've clear data/cache. Uninstall and reinstalled. It still does it.
"Bad UI in an otherwise good app. There is no point in adding albums/songs to your favorites, as there is no ""personal"" collection. If you usually organize your music by artist, clicking on the artist in your collection will take you to the store page, where you have to scroll past their entire discography to get to the album you want. Essentially, ""favoriting"" something doesn't actually add it to your collection, but only provides a shortcut to play it off of the artist page. Make it make sense."
"When this app actually decides to work it is really amazing. But almost every day when I put on music my songs skip, it's like I'm putting a scratched record on. I pay for premium and this makes it so that I have to skip through my songs and end up not being able to listen to over half the songs on my favorites. It's really discouraging and I'm considering canceling my subscription due to this issue."
"It does what it intends to, and if you had never seen another music streaming app in your life before deezer then you would probably love it. When compared to other streaming apps such as Spotify though, it can't compete, for Deezer you have to have premium to even listen to your liked songs Playlist, it's annoying. I get that you need to make money, but it's honestly a no brainer for me."
"The good: it transfers all your playlists from another music platform. The bad: in the free version, you can't play the songs in your actual playlist - not even randomized. Instead, it plays a mix ""inspired by"" your playlist. And they don't even SAY that it's a premium feature! That's B.S., and I'm leaving. P.S. I can't AFFORD a paid subscription. So stop trying to get me to buy. Not gonna happen."
"First no update notes, second this and every Deezer app freezes up, skips, and had problems even in downloaded lists. Third, it's really scammy the way they make you sign up for hifi family. You have to be a paid member, so you either have to wait a month to upgrade, or pay twice in the same month. Granted I contacted them and they waived it as a ""one time gesture of good will"", but it shouldn't be that way. Regardless, it's unusable on multiple devices and connections, including high speed."
"My purpose for getting this service was to work with Echo and Alexa. I was utterly dissappointed. When I ask to play a named playlist it gives me some unknown songs I've never heard, and they are horrible. I've tried many suggestions from both Deezer and other forums and nothing has worked. I like the app. I can even upload my own music, but until this issue is fixed I won't be using it."
"This is probably the best streaming app out there. But, playing music or a podcast via Chromecast is horrible. Music will randomly stop or of if I leave the app to go into another app, the app will freeze and start all over again. Finally, there are major loading issues as well I'm constantly having to wait for a song to load."
The service is great. The app is terrible. It does a great job of picking out curated lists that go together and sound right. The problem is you have to do it through in less annoying app. I've had the same problems with this app with several different phones by different manufacturers.
"I have been searching far and wide for a replacement to Google play. I decided to try the premium version of Deezer . The app is nice looking the desktop version is a nice feature. I really like the ability to sync my songs online but also play them off line when I'm at the beach. I need Android auto...check. Here comes the bad part, after uploading my database of songs I realised there is no way to sort the songs I Uploaded by genre. This was the reason I did not move to YouTube music."
"The app is fine for use on phone (with headphones). The problem starts when I want to stream music to other devices (Heos enabled receiver) which can really benefit from CD and higher quality. Unfortunately, there is no option to directly strean to the receiver from within the app like it was chromecast. If Spotify can do it, see no reason why Deezer can't. Even more unfortunate, is that when trying to use Deezer service from Heos app, it is limited to 320 mp3! Canceled my subscription."
"I think Deezer has the potential to be a great music app if you could switch audio output location. I use several audio outputs throughout my days. Through Spotify I regularly cycle the app's audio output to Sonos, my car, my phone, my laptop, etc. Spotify changes the output with a simple button push from the 'Listening On' menu in the queue. I would prefer to use Deezer, but this oversight takes Deezer off my list. Perhaps I am missing something?"
"Overall, the experience using Deezer is buggy and unreliable. Google casting fails more often than it works. At times, you'll try to select a new song and the app won't respond . Android Auto mixes don't function. Slow to start streaming compared to competitors. And of course condescending app review replies which imply the app isn't broken bit rather it's users are using it wrong"
"I came to this app because I looked up apps that arent like spotify and are free. This is literally just another Spotify. I don't see the point in calling this a music app when you can't even look up individual songs and put them on your own playlist. And half of the songs I have found you have to pay for, which I refuse to do."
"It's hard to relize what you didn't have before you got it. Hifi is game changing Edit: sound quality is great but the app is absolute bollucks. Every 10 or so songs it will have a failed to connect error and I will then have to go into the app, press ""retry"" and see if that works (wifi: >100mbps) SOME TIMES IT DOESN'T! So then I have to go into the album and click on the song MANUALLY to play it. This is basic quality control and server interfacing, it shouldn't be like this for $15/month!"
"I used this app for years. Premium membership. Here and there I had trouble playing different songs, but overall I was happy with it. But all of the sudden it just stopped working. I could not sign back in, even if I reset my password or reinstalled the app. Customer service sucks now, I remember there used to be number you could call, it's not the case now. They weren't able to resolve the issue and I had to deactivate my account. Super disappointing and frustrating...."
"This app is terrible. Crashes frequently, even if I'm just trying to go into my list. I have to use the PC app to manage any of that. The only reason why I'm keeping Deezer over Spotify is that it allows you to upload your own music for listening on any device instead of just what's local."
"The app seems great just at first look. I was able to find any song I searched for. But if you don't pay then you are pretty much limited to songs and playlists made by the app. Even if you play your favorited tracks the app only plays random songs, not any of the songs from your favorited list which is honestly annoying. Again, great app, but you must pay if you want to be able to have as much control you have in SoundCloud."
"It seems like it's a good app, the layout and all, it'd be nice to be able to listen to a song more than 30 seconds without premium. I'm not talking annoying ads, I'm talking it restricts you from listening to songs more than 30 seconds without getting premium. I basically installed this app to listen to 505 by Arctic Monkeys, because on Soundcloud you have to have GO+ and on Spotify, you need to have premium to choose a specific song. It has potential. Just limits you in use. ): Uninstalled."
"The algorithm seems good and it could have been a good alternative to other services, but they have switched to playing featured tracks instead of ads, and the algorithm is not being taken into account so you end up with weird songs that don't fit what you are listening to. On top of that, you have to listen for 30 seconds, and blocking the song does not work. I listened to the same featured song five times before uninstalling the app. Trash song, trash functionality"
"Okay first I do not speak Spanish, why is there only Spanish playlist in my main menu feed, this needs to be changed or else I will never use this app again. Second there needs to be a quick way to get to the bottom quick menu so I don't need to click back 12 times, it's very frustrating when you're a DJ of high-end private parties. Third there needs to be a better implantation of continuing random songs, I don't want to hear Back Street Boys when I've been enjoying Nirvana for the past 3 hours."
"Deezer has been great until about 1 month ago, when I play a song it sometimes will play once or twice then I will get error message saying ""cancel or retry"" then I can never play that song again, other times I'm not able to play a song at all, keep getting the same error message. I Uninstalled and reinstalled the app, it worked for a few days, its doing the same thing not playing music."
"Good selection, but hard to navigate to music you can ""download"", which you actually can not download to your device at all, even as a premium subscriber. If I pay for premium service, I should be able to download music to my device (I wouldn't have a problem with the download self deleting every so often), so I can play through my own music player. I can not play through my Kenwood Weblink, or my Pioneer Weblink, for display purposes, or to overlay my Navigation System. If so would rate 5 star"
"I got this app, cuz google play is going away and it rated high. This app could not be slower. Every time I try to go to a playlist, it takes so long, I get the warning message that it's not responding, with options to wait or close app. This occurs every time. About to dump it, but unfortunately, I purchased the subscription. May dump it anyway."
"I got Deezer for a couple months ago. For a while, I loved it. But it seems like recently, I haven't been able to enjoy it. I don't know if y'all updated it, but shuffle play now plays random songs that I don't like, instead of a shuffled list of my fav songs. It really killed the whole thing for me. What's the point of using a music app that doesn't let me listen to music that I enjoy? I'm switching back to Spotify soon, if this remains the case. :("
"Sometimes when listening to and album the next song won't play. Then when I hit play it acts for a fraction of a second that it is going to play, then stops. I have to tap again to maybe get it to play. Heck of a way to run an app while driving a car. Could cause an accident."
"Good service. I'm taking stars away for 3 reasons. 1) the app sometimes lag 2) when I exit the app or view the song I'm currently listening to, even I go back to view my favorite list, I expect the app to not refresh and go back to the top of the list, but instead stay where I was at. I'm going to take another off because I noticed that even after I remove a song from my favorites, it will continue to play them as if they were still a favorite. 3) when I close the app, it continues playing."
"The new update causes my flow to continually spawn the wheel even when I've been listening to a track and haven't clicked on it. Multiple times I've tried to like songs that pop up on the flow and it automatically changes the station to ""chill"" even though I hadn't brought up the wheel. The song I tried to favorite does get added to my liked songs, but it's frustrating when pressing the heart causes the flow to change. I love this app, please fix this!"
"Overall is not bad. There are lots of problems in the UI and also UX. Need tons of work. There's also a lot of promblems in streaming. Sometimes it's just too slow to load a portion of the song... plus, some of the discographies are not complete."
"UPDATE over 3 yrs review: NEW: Press play but no audio plays, track progress is shown STILL BROKEN: 90% of the time the app keeps showing me the load bar and does not answer to any command , cleaning cache and relogin is a pain and doesn't help at all. 50% of the times it suddenly stops while playing a playlist. The UI is terrible to the point that I repeat the same mistakes over and over again. FIXED: doesn't hog space anymore; Interesting information bout a track/queue is improved a bit"
"I know I shouldn't complain about something that is free, but the ads are killing me. Or rather one ad in particular. ""It's okay to have favourites..."" plays every two songs, or up seven times an hour. At least run different ads, I'd be fine with that. But these promos for Deezer's paid subscriptions have the opposite effect and only make me want to uninstall. Edit: Yes, I understand ads are part of the free service. It's the constant repetition of the same ad that is the issue."
"Premium user. Please fix musics not starting and saying ""unable to load"". It's quite annoying having to check my phone every 10 minutes when I'm doing something else with music on. Also please fix podcasts. They have become hardly listenable with their horrendous loading times and terrible media controls : when I try to skip forward 30 seconds, the podcast crashes and I have to restart the app and relisten from the beginning. Would be much appreciated if you all could fix this."
"Used it for about a year. I wanted to give it a try because it pays more to the artists. Well now I don't think about this so much anymore and start using Sp***fy Cons: -i am missing a few artists -It crashes without any reason. Newest versions of OS and Deezer on an Samsung S10 -Not supported on old S7 anymore, but somehow spotify does -none of my family wants it. Its like everybody uses bluray and I wanted to keep HDdiscs -flow is really lame and doesn't show you new stuff like it is supposed"
"The ""discography"" section has disappeared for a lot of artists. The app is becoming worse each time. Also it's annoying that you can't navigate through the REAL discography of an artist, without all the editions of the same album, and sometimes with the publication date being a mess."
"Struggles to work on current Pixel 7, extremely slow to download tracks for offline listening, about 5 minutes per song, even with 100mbps internet. Glad I'm on the free month trial and I didn't buy the 12 month deal! Track quality is fantastic though, through my hi res headphone and amp, and flow is almost as good as Spotify."
"This app used to be so awesome, but now it's dog water. 2 songs and then an ad, really? It's the same stupid ad over and over again as well. Also, it crashes constantly, mid song sometimes. If this is the best you can do, I'm going back to Spotify."
Have always loved this app but now it's just frustrating! It will play 2 or 3 songs and then just close the app and stop playing.. also the song listening tool doesn't work anymore it can never fins tracks when I use it! Deezer has gone rubbish.
"I used to love Deezer, but recently, I have seen the app's functions be restricted by a pay wall. I can't even play any music i want or listen to an ablum from the start without buying premium. Now I know that you guys need the money to keep the app afloat, but I don't see why that means my use of Deezer has to be restricted, just because I don't have premium."
"Used to be 5 stars now only 2 stars at best. There is definitely a bug that stops me using this app. It keeps saying 'failed to play please retry"" but it never can restart any song etc and just comes back with the same error.. So I unistall and retry it then works for a very short while and then stops with same error again. Same merry-go-round of rubbish. Makes it unusuable etc. Such a ashame it was a good app hence 'was' now utter garbage for the last several months. What is going on...🤷"
"Extremely bugged. Search bars often load infinitely even with working network connection. Can't select music tracks every now and then, and the app crashes constantly. Fix this."
"The app becomes almost non functional when you try to download music. It's laggy or crashes, doesn't load the downloaded songs in the menu, stops downloading randomly, and does not show a download queue"
"Bad stability, when compared to Spotify crashes dayly vs Spotify's weekly. Cannot add songs to queue while listening to your full saved music library. Only thing this has going for it over Spotify is better ui and hifi audio."
"Used to be a good app, but you can no longer see an artist's albums from their artist page - the only way to find an album is to find one of the tracks from the album in the tracks section of the artist page, and then go to the album page from that track. Very annoying update as someone who likes to listen to albums."
"Songs frequently won't load, and I have to pause then play to force it to start. Songs often pause to buffer after 6 seconds then immediately jump ahead by a minute. Favourites list regularly jumps back to the top for no apparent reason."
"Discographies are poorly laid out. There needs to be a new section under an artist that contains main album releases. To many popular artists (dead or alive) have so many anniversary, special editions, live, platinum, re-release, remastered, re-re-release etc it turns discographies into a nightmare. Just have section devoted to proper album releases."
Even when an album is downloaded it has skipping issues like its streaming even though its not. I put it in offline mode & it skips like I have a poor signal but that doesn't make sense. I downloaded so I would not have this problem
"Used to enjoy using this app but a peculiar bug has emerged. Songs just won't load. They will be stuck saying ""Just wait one moment"". I've waited an hour and a half for them to load. Not a connection issue, logging out doesn't help. Uninstalling and reinstalling fixes it until I close the app and reopen it. Then it happens again. Have to un and reinstall every time I want to listen to music. I cannot find anything on my problem in the forums. Very disappointed."
"Song selection not great, repeats the same songs to much and doesn't use your liked artist as Input. just plays what it wants even songs and artists that you said to not recommend anymore. How many time can I say no to MGK and avril Lavigne before they stop forcing it into every playlist"
"Contstant buffering, plays one song on the lock screen then requires me to unlock phone to continue. Just overall bad experience. Flows not bad though."
"Search Option doesn't want to work. And when having either weak or no internet, songs do not want to be played, despite having them downloaded."
"Went to use today, and it's as though I'd never used it before. No login, just select at least 3 artists. I'm glad I haven't subscribed, It would piss me off if I've got to do this every few months. I just can't be bothered doing it all again, so I'll stick with Spotify."
"On the phone itself the Deezer app is OK, but via Android Auto (where I mostly try to use it) it is woeful. Frequently freezes, locks up, very limited options for music selection when it is working. Problems can sometimes be resolved by stopping the car and launching the app on the phone, but then what's the point of Android Auto!"
"Although I love the High fi, The app keeps dropping and keeps coming up retry keeps losing the Wi-Fi signal every 3 or 4 songs. Is irritating as h*** especially in my car we do to fix this?"
I have been a premium user for over 3 years but i am thinking of cancelling my subscription. I enjoyed the experience but as of recently the App keeps on closing unexpectedly which is so annoying 😤
"Great app, but lately crashes every 20-30min... If I clear my cache, I'll loose all the saved songs. Btw, I'm a premium user."
The application does not work properly offline with the downloaded music on android 9. It used to work before.
"Listening music from black artists... ""N"" is blanked, making the song flow so bad it is horrible to listen. I paid to listen to music, not Redacted pile of trash."
"I have a family plan with Deezer. I am not very happy at this point, as my deezer just stops playing when it is on repeat folder. It will he playing a song then suddenly half way through its stops playing only to find out that it's gone completely off. I am not sure why this would happen but please if someone could give me some advice on how to fix this problem I would appreciate it."
"Sucks now. Recent updates have ruined the experience. It freezes, plays pure French speaking ads to me now which is crazy annoying at full speaker, and the ads have bugs. So ad plays, fails to load next song, retry reload, ad plays again - in French - vicious loop. Have to close and reopen app and restart playback. If you want me to subscribe maybe make an app that works"
"Trying to download Playlists are a nightmare, either freezing or trying to spam download the Playlist over and over again. Never had this problem with spotify"
"Pretty mid app overall but the ads are crazy 1:30!? That's even worse than Spotify and yt music. Speaking of Spotify stop trying to be them so badly with the shuffle play. That's why I switched to SoundCloud, not to many ads and they are short, have many different versions of songs, and if you don't have premium you don't have to use shuffle. But yeah the ads gotta be shorter."
My main problem is that my phone is getting very hot after use this app. And my email don't receive verification codes. Edit: With support help I could recover my account and change my email. But my phone still is very warm while using the app. Until they fixed it. I can't recommend the app. I also reinstall the app.
"When casting to my Onkyo Receiver and changing the song, deezer endlessly loops in loading (only a few seconds left). The only way to stop this from happening is to end the app and restart it. On Testversion, not very convinced yet."
It works OK but no more than this. The recommendation algorithm sucks at best. The program crashes with an error every day at least once ever hour or so.
"The app keeps crashing ( just closing out ). Please fix it, long term deezerist but this is very annoying. If not fixed i consider cancelling the subscription"
"Has been crashing consistently for about a month and a half, just too much effort to change playlists on to another service. wouldn't recommend"
Why isn't my playlists the first thing I see? Why is it a chore to get to my saved music? Sigh Edit* It's an UX issue. Why can't I change my home page? Why do I see anything but my own selection of music? It's stupid
App keeps crashing. I've reinstalled a few times now and happens on multiple devices which is pretty frustrating
I have tried that and it still skips and just stops playing! It skips parts of the songs and just shuts off for no dang reason!
"Love listening to my music through Deezer in my car. Wanted to the other night but can't access the site. Says unable to load. Retry. So I have a number of times, same message. Tried updating the app but its already up to date. If I reinstall will I lose all the music I've downloaded? Not happy."
"Went downhill over the last year. Clearly lacking in features and availability of podcasts (no mark-read, etc), bugs and crashes. The only redeeming features are hifi quality and good (yearly) price. But with all the bugs - simply not worth the trouble."
"I'm slowly getting used to the terrible UI overall but the quality of the music is incredible. Which is why I have deezer. BUT for quite some time now(worse more so) the app just crashes mid-way through songs, like, you're a music app, why do you struggle to play music? 🤔 if you fixed your basic bugs, maybe you guys would finally overtake Spotify."
As a long time subscriber I'm very disappointed that the latest update has removed (or hidden away in some obscure menu) the very useful sleep timer function which I used on a regular basis. Please bring this function back or make it easier to find if it's still available within the app.
"Page with ""pre-diwnloaded music"" does not opens without internet XD. Useless! On PC skip 5-10 tracks and your are banned for 2 mins (connection errors). Do you...test your service? Like trying to use it for some time. Why no?"
App still randomly signing me out. It's stupid and tge trouble shooting steps don't make a famn bit of difference.
"This app is garbage for Chromecast. It constantly locks up and stops casting. I've never had an issue while using Spotify. I switched to get higher bit rates, but this app is terrible on my Galaxy S21."
"the app is slow, very slow to load up, and it freezes quite often. Offline content is not 100%offline as you need internet for the initial load up of the app. , very dissapointing, hope you guys fix the app soon to justify your increas in price for subscription"
Absolute mess as of recent. 1.: Can't search for & immediately play any song upon 1st launch. HAVE to restart the app so I can play it. 2.: Track mixes won't launch if chosen track is in current playlist.
I play long playlist! But the app regularly closes when not listening so I have to restart them without even getting halfway through!! I have tried leaving widget on and still the same issues
Sometimes the app just stops playing and exits the app on its own. Well not sometimes. Almost always. Android.
"Never had a problem with this app until a few days ago. I pay for the premium service. Music keeps cutting out randomly, skip function doesn't always work. Not sure what's going on with it!"
"Used to work with Android Auto but now just hangs and says ""no items"". I thought this would fix itself but it's been a couple months and still won't work. Guess it's time to cancel my subscription."
I've had deezer a while now. And it's not so good. Sick of it stopping and app closing please sort it out!!
Bought premium. Used it for a few months but it stopped working today despite the subscription being active.
This app needs some serious fixes: 1. The shuffle is awful- it plays the same MAYBE 20 songs out of the 200+ I have on my playlist and always slips into the same queue no matter how many times I re-shuffle 2. It is nearly impossible to properly remove songs from playlists (they don't show up on the track list but play anyway) 3. My music is constantly being muted/paused/restarted at random intervals The list goes on and it's clear that Spotify has Deezer beat- I just can't afford my own account.
every 2nd song keeps cutting of retry pay for a premium for something that keeps failing
Crashes too many times The problem has existed for too long
"Great sound quality and library but the app is full of bugs, especially casting. Shame because there's a lot to like using Deezer but bugs ruin any long term enjoyment."
Update: i am getting really sick of the fake bands. NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR THAT. Update. Nice job. AI is massively improved. Keep deleting the fake bands.The HQ plan definitely streams and sounds better than Spotify or YouTube now. The AI is much improved and.more content is being added. No paywall like the Q people. You can upload your own mp3 files to their cloud for free and listen anywhere. I think it's the best HQ/audiophile streaming app.
"I really enjoy this app, however every once in a while I get logged out for some reason and when I try access my account it refuses. Today I mistakenly signed up to a new account cause it kicked me out I canceled 10 minutes later and it's now charged me. Meanwhile I've paid for my other Deezer access 😔I'm thoroughly not please with this hence I've dropped my rating."
"I have very mixed feelings about this app. I love the way it works and I absolutely love the integrated lyrics. I was looking to switch from Spotify , but a couple of things stopped me. Firstly, I am using a galaxy S8+ and still, the app was laggy. Animations are not smooth at all. When I click on pages, it loads them instead of having them, it's like a web page and not an app. Also, the integration with last FM doesn't seem to work, which is also a huge deal for me. The last thing I noticed was that the music widget looks absolutely awful. If all these things get sorted, I would absolutely love to switch to Deezer from Spotify. A lot of potential, with a few key issues that could be fixed. If they do get sorted, I'll gladly change my rating as well."
"The sound quality is good and there are a fair number of features to toggle in the settings. There's also a wide variety of music to listen to. However even when I turn of ""automix"" (on mobile) it still plays the same limited set of songs from any given artist or playlist instead of ALL of them, so unless I go in and manually add in the dozens or hundreds of songs I wanted to also listen to, there are many songs that never see the light of day, and it's getting to the point of ticking me off."
"Wow, the app's gone downhill recently. I regularly use it to control what music is playing on connected devices, usually my desktop or the system at work. But it's been giving me a lot of issues now. I randomly can't edit the queue, the song displayed on the app won't be the one playing currently, pausing/skipping/etc. won't work. It's really frustrating."
"The app is great and all, but when it comes to making playlists... I can have a calm playlist and listen to whatever it has in it, and then all of a sudden, a recommended song gets put into my playlist. It's very annoying. The only time this doesn't happen is when the playlists are HOURS long, I can't even express how much it annoys me. Also, when I search for a song, it always takes me to a playlist called it, and I have to use my free skips JUST to get to the song because we can't access it"
"Overall, not bad, however, there seems to be some issue with my playlists now. When I reopen the app on my phone the playlist automatically closes and I have to find my spot again. Very annoying especially when you've got hundreds of songs. This hasn't always been an issue. Seems to be some kind of ""update"". Also, the bot suggestions to logout log back in of course didn't work. Maybe one day there will be an actual solutions instead of babbling from a script."
"Was great up until about a week ago. I love using the genre filters, especially at work but for some reason every time I choose a genre, a message pops up saying, ""You have filters set which may hide some results"" except I haven't changed anything. I've cleared the cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, updated the app, etc., but nothing has fixed the issue. It's pretty frustrating because I LOVE the genre feature. Please fix asap."
"New UI is awful. Fewer song options are shown on the screen at the same time, and you have to scroll like tiktok now. Why? One song or playlist takes up 70% of the vertical space and the whole width. DJ beta is cool and I enjoyed it. The new UI is very bad. This should be a new tab, not the home page. I want the home page to be easy access to my usual music options, and a new ""explore"" tab would be nice. Edit: Spotify has moved the new UI to the ""Music"" button on the homepage, much better."
"I cannot even play my old playlist. I had to keep moving forward on which song the app would play. Worse, if the song is playing, it hangs up and need to keep pressing forward. I thought it only happens on compact disc but it happens on an app! 😅This is kinda frustrating when you are paying for premium! Come on Spotify you can do better than this!! It's been happening for sometime already."
"Literal garbage. Don't bother getting this app. You can pay for the ""premium"" to listen offline but it'll never work. You can even turn on the ""offline mode"" setting. Still won't work. The minute you lose data connection or wifi connection you'll lose any ability to listen to downloaded songs or podcasts. Not worth the hassle, try elsewhere"
"In the last 6 months the app will just stop every minute or two for no reason. Or just randomly. Internet or cell service is good, bluetooth is connected, app is still running and playing, but no sound. Then, when I start the song again it plays from the beginning of the song after I wait for a few seconds. This issue is being reported all over the internet, FIX IT."
"They're tons of music on this app, but for some reason the ""short ads"" then ""30 minutes of free music"" changed. It's not 30 minutes of music anymore, more like 1 song then 10 minutes of ads. My family agrees with me and say the same thing. I hope Spotify can fixes this because the app wasn't like this before, and this p!sees me off so much. I was literally trying to sleep but I swear I went insane and now I'm writing this review at 1 am in the morning. Do better."
"Selection is great, and there are lots of genres for the entire family to find their favorite songs in. We've had trouble getting the app to work properly with our Echo Dots for speakers, several times we attempt to adjust the volume up or down with my S21 Ultra and the volume cranks to max or mutes completely. This experience has been incredibly jarring, and I have had to uninstall several times recently to fix the issue, but it doesn't seem to stay fixed for very long."
"They should have finished the app years ago, but instead they continue to push user-hostile features to increase ""engagement"". Pop-ups, looping videos, auto-start in when I'm in my car, ""smart-shuffle"" that nobody wants, and some of these can't be disabled because you have to listen to it the way they want you to. Maybe one of their 10,000 employees could figure out how to create a radio station that doesn't repeat the same songs over and over, but I guess they're trying to save bandwidth..."
"I didn't have a bad thing to say about Spotify until they added smart shuffle. It has got to be the single worst update to the app yet. I like to shuffle my playlist a few times before I get into it so I hear a different order of songs. Smart shuffle has made that near impossible, it destroys the vibes I'm going for. It's my playlist I know what I want to hear. If this feature isn't removed or at least made a separate button in a month, I'm seriously considering switching platforms"
"Generally a good music app, but it has one major flaw that is enraging. When my phone is locked I have to hit the pause button at least 3 times before it will pause. Sometimes more. Why? This is dumb as hell. Update: Now the app won't load the main home screen half the time and it's a struggle to even get it to keep playing music. It keeps pausing randomly. I try to back out to the home screen and nothing loads. Ugh"
"Obviously suffering from serious technical debt. Every few months, a different, fundamental aspect of the app is broken. One long-standing issue is how the queue gets messed up and plays songs you just heard when you open the app again after closing it. Stop prioritizing features and dedicate months to fixing the Android app. I really shouldn't be supporting this, but it's too much of a pain to move to a different streaming service at the moment."
"Every few months they'll push out an update that completely breaks the app. It's currently unusable, having deleted all downloaded songs and crashing everytime it starts in ""offline mode"" (which means you can't change that setting). The UI bounces between decent and garbage as programmers justify their continued employment. The current iteration is pretty bad. The shuffle setting is, and always has been, terrible. The app turns itself on and autoplays when my phone's BT connects to my car."
"It's a good app and I'm happy with it, but here recently it has been acting odd, It'll be in the middle of playing a song when suddenly the sound starts to spot in and out and I can't pause or unpause the song, it only fixes when I re-enter the app. it's frustrating and I don't understand why it is doing it, I've tried everything but it won't fix. I'm not sure if it is a problem on my end or if it has something to do with the actual Spotify app so I'm leaving this review in hopes for a solution."
"Spotify is good on anything else except for mobile, you have to pay to skip songs, they mix the songs that you want to listen to with random other songs that I guess they think you will like and if you don't want that to happen then you need to pay for a subscription. Also it used to be easy to navigate now it's barely unusable and confusing, screw that the whole app is unusable and confusing unless you decide to pay a subscription. bruh"
"I only downloaded the app so I could listen to Brandon Sanderson's Secret Novels. This app is not audiobook friendly. There is no setting to see your progress through the book as a whole. The worst part is that once the next chapter plays, you can't rewind back to the previous chapter. I mainly listen while driving, so this is a huge disadvantage. I would die trying to navigate through 60+ chapters trying to find the needed location. There is more to say, but I have run out of my 500 characters."
"Spotify is my go to music app, but as of late it has been really bad. I start playing music and as soon as my screen time out the music stops. I hit the button to open screen and music begins to play, this needs to be resolved. I know you are going to say contact customer service but if I am a premium paying customer (for years now) I just ask that this issue be taken care of, it's very annoying."
"This has become such a bad app over time if all you want is a robust way to listen to music. They are pushing podcasts and audiobooks and TikTok-like features, and I don't want any of it. They also do AB testing of new features so sometimes things are different and sometimes not - even without app updates. I really wish you could opt out of all of those previously mentioned features. Why can't I be here just for the music?"
"App crashes the first time I put a video episode into full screen mode, requiring a second attempt every time I do it. This requires watching another set of ads. Ads pull it back out of full screen mode and require putting it back into full screen when the episode returns. This is annoying and makes it feel like the video feature maybe wasn't fully tested before rolling out."
"The Spotify app seems to progressively get more and more broken. Over half the time it is unable to connect to my Google home set up when no other streaming service has issue. Recently Spotify has often been unable to play newly released podcasts and songs on anything other than the app, i.e. desktop, laptop, smart speaker, etc. The it's common for me to leave the app in the middle of a podcast, then come back to the app later, hit play, and it start the podcast over from the beginning."
"It was amazing when I first got it because even without premium, I did not have to deal with just a shitload of ads, but that still did not stop me from purchasing premium so that I could listen offline. I have been trying to save money recently and it seems that there are more ads then when I first got Spotify, because I don't remember having to listen to three ads after every song, it's ridiculous! And not to mention that apparently you don't get to skip songs anymore without premium."
"Idk know if it's an update, but why can you only skip 6 times!?!? It's seriously annoying. Not to mention the fact they changed how playlists look, you used to be able to see the album cover, name, ect as one section and have a row that goes down. Now it's just the song name in this inconvenient list. Plus it's permanently on shuffle and you can't go back to a previous song! It does nothing but piss me off anymore."
"I've been using spotify since 2011, and this app has never made an update that wasn't an improvement. Until this last update. The new UI kills all the good things about spotify in the past. Now, my new music that was originally placed right below my most recent plays is completely gone. The UI provides no utility and only crowds, which used to be useful information, with random videos of music you already listen to. This design is completely out of touch."
"I use spotify mainly for its ability to run with the phone shut off. However, its extremely frustrating to use. It practically forces you to get premium, making it borderline unusable otherwise. And it often starts playing songs I've never heard or dont like- ""suggested songs"" that I can't exit out of because it still considers it my playlist. And, now, there is a glitch where my songs stop completely in the 9-12 second mark. I've cleared the apps cache, updated it, nothing works."
"Spotify used to make it easy for me to filter my music but now I can't even do that anymore. I tried uninstalling, reinstalling, login out, reseting my phone. EVERYTHING but it just doesn't register my music. It just says you have filters set which hides some results which makes no sense since I have thousands of songs saved. And it's been happening since the update."
"Doesn't understand my phone has service so refuses to play. Also doesn't understand under circumstances where service isn't available, downloaded songs can still play. Because they're downloaded. Just doesn't really want to play anything. Especially when you move outside your ""home network"". No other apps have problems. Edit: Now has problems where it stops at a reoccurring interval. Downloaded songs seem to play better now."
"I have premium and like to listen to my personally curated playlists all the time. The app forces me to listen to the same 12 or so songs on over 200 song playlists, even if I press skip 3 dozen times. Will probably unsubscribe soon if they don't change this. Edit: They have updated the app so you can turn off Smart Shuffle, which is an improvement."
"The app won't let me put more songs on one of my playlists. It is 30 hours. The app used to let me add songs, but the app wouldn't consider them as part of my playlist, and won't say my playlist is longer. Now I can't add any. I know I don't have 10,000 songs on there. I only have around 500-600 songs. Also, the ""now enjoy 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" is a lie."
I used to have a 5 star review for this. I have been a paying subscriber for many years years now. And here recently I have had nothing but issues with it. Music randomly shuts off for no reason and stops playing no matter what Bluetooth device or playing through my phone. When hooked up to Bluetooth it will automatically start playing music from Spotify no matter what which drives me nuts. I dont want my music blasting at 530 in the morning when I start my truck to go to work. This NEEDS fixed.
"When wanting to remove a song, the search option disappears when enhanced shuffle is on, and there's no option to remove a song from the pop up menu, so the user must go searching through the playlist to find the song to remove. The ""enhance"" feature has potential but is currently very poorly implemented. Additionally, swipe to add to queue does not seem to work when enhanced shuffle is enabled."
"Generally good with a premium account. Unusable otherwise. Adds advertising to podcasts even with a paid premium account. Constant pop up recommendations interrupting your browsing even if you turn them off. Has a ""smart shuffle"" feature that results in lagging, especially over cellular, and adds songs to your playlist and queue whether you want them or not. It's an interesting feature but the fact you have to toggle through it to get to normal shuffling is cumbersome and obnoxious."
"good if you have premium but I don't so I can't really listen to music, all I hear is ads instead. please fix this, I want to listen to my playlist not six garbage shopify ads in a row then maybe one song. and most of the features that are on premium are completely unreasonable like the skips. the only thing I should have to pay for is to download licensed songs, not to listen to the song I searched instead of nine ads and then a song that isn't even remotely similar to what I was looking for"
"Premiums not worth it, you still receive ads for other podcasts and music. Supposedly I'm able to listen to my music offline with premium, cannot do that consistently either, it won't even pull up my music at times when I'm in offline. Recently got rid of premium because even though I was paying for no ads now my homepage is not only podcasts I don't want to see but it is also an auto-play of stuff I never asked for. It's not that difficult to just make an app that plays music and yet-"
"I couldn't play any of the songs I listened to the most, so I reinstalled spotify and all my downloaded songs (10gb) got deleted... This is going to take a while. It is surprising that an app like this has big bugs. I have also been unable to login to this on 3 separate occasions. Usually reinstalling it immediately fixes it, but sometimes it doesn't."
"I have always loved Spotify which is why I pay for it HOWEVER lately it's very frustrating, especially when I'm driving. While listening to a playlist, after about 5 songs or so, it either stops playing altogether OR goes back to the song it started off with 5 songs prior rather than playing the entire playlist. And I can't seem to get any help with my issue!!"
"1, the ads are EXTREMELY intrusive sometimes going up to 5 at a time. Number 2, I will be casually listening to my one and only playlist and I will get bombarded by random songs I've never heard and never want to hear. I wish Spotify didn't make their app feel like such a cash grab. EDIT: I had to change my rating from 3 to 2 stars just because the ads are even worse, now I will only listen to 1 song and get 3 ads at a time, all of which I've heard a million times. Fix PLEASE they suck."
Spotify plays the most popular songs on repeat even when I have it on shuffle very annoying I have other songs I would like to hear without this app shutting itself off after 4 songs & then playing them over and over. Finding music is great if that is all you want it for. Listening to podcasts has gotten better since I've started paying for it.
"Please bring back 'enhance.' Also it seems like it'd be easy to have a feature that searches history & excludes songs already played that day when shuffling. Right now I'm stuck either shuffling, which repeats songs every 12 or so, but allegedly has 'smart shuffle ' to introduce new options, or listening to my list in the order I added them, which is generally by artist. There's no way to shuffle the songs and hear ALL the songs I added. My 1st experience paying for premium & I'm not impressed"
"Spotify's service is great, but the app has just become too sluggish and clunky lately. Playlists load slower and songs have an odd delay before playing. Menus load extremely slowly too, which makes adding a song to multiple playlists a nightmare, especially since clicking the menu now pulls you out of the song-control screen and puts you back in the playlist view."
"i can find majority of the songs i want to listen to and its an easy app to use. i have no trouble which is pretty cool :D my problem here is that whenever i play a song, it starts then stops after a few seconds. this bugs me a lot because i want noise to block out any noise because i usually get angry at sounds and stuff from people. it upsets me that i have to try and play the song again, but it stops again :( ive uninstalled then reinstalled it, i hope that works at least (edit: it didn't)"
I've used this apps since I was in middle school and I haven't had any problems with it until recently. I'm not sure if it was the update or if it's just a glitch but lately whenever I try to play music from a playlist I made or try to listen to new music it was would play for 10 seconds and then just stop. I would speed it forward a few seconds to see what would happen but it doesn't do anything. I also tried pressing the play button a few times but no go. I might have to uninstall and reinstal
"One of the best music apps BUT I'm Supremely frustrated that I'm going to have to delete my entire profile just to unfollow an unwanted podcast that keeps playing after reporting that I don't like it, it should really have the same feature implemented to 'block' from listening to certain podcasts (the same that's already in use for artists) as I'm TIRED OF SEEING IT. It's been WEEKS and it won't get off my home screen no matter how many other podcasts I listen to. Disgustingly frustrating."
"My app stopped working today. None of my music will play, and when it does, it won't go past 9-10 seconds. I have restarted my phone, cleared my cache multiple times, cleared my user data, deleted and reinstalled the app, tried Data and Internet only, and turned my Bluetooth on and off. It will not play. My attempt to contact an advisor as previously suggested led to a bot telling me that their advisors were experiencing internal tool issues and to come back another time."
"For something I spend $10 a month on and can't live without, I sure do have a lot of issues with the app. The mobile app is absolute trash. Asking me about driving mode when all I'm trying to do is switch playlists is annoying. The options menu for songs on mobile makes me irrationally angry because of how difficult it makes it to cultivate a good playlist. Like, I just want to delete this song from the playlist that it is playing, why can't I have that option? I just hate this app :)"
"Overall I like the app, but, here in the recent weeks, if not months, when I play music, it will automatically start to play when I connect my phone to another vehicle or device. I've cleared cache I have setup to never automatically start playing, I've force stop the app, but it still automatically starts playing. Not a fan!!"
"Devs favor iOS. If they just ported over all the same features, I'd switch back to Spotify as my main, but it's clunky compared to everything else on Android at the moment. And the new home menu is also very inconvenient. The old layout was better than the story, tiktok inspired home menu. Honestly, the mobile app needs a better refresh. Or iOS features on Android at the very least. (Edit) At least they got rid of the tictok like feature"
"New update is incredibly annoying. I don't need Spotify to work like TikTok. It's a total waste of screen space on the home screen and I think most people would rather have more options to choose from, separated into categories like how it used to be. It would make more sense if the new swipe screen existed within its own ""discover"" or ""explore"" tab and for the home screen to have more information that someone would actually expect to have on a home screen."
"I've been using Spotify for years but now I'm starting to get a bit upset with the ads on the mobile app. There's an ad after EVERY song most of the time, and often the end of the song gets completely cut off just to play an ad, but I'm not able to pay for premium to remove ads to fix these problems on my own. I don't have this issue with the desktop app, but I don't want to have to listen on desktop just to avoid ad interruptions after every song."
"Fine as far as catalog and quality, but those things are not any better or worse than what else is out there. UX leaves a lot to be desired, even as a paying customer. There's usually an intrusive full-screen pop-up every time I open the app. The queue is horrendous - you can't see what's been played recently and what's upcoming is limited. Clearing individual songs is clunky and you're unable to clear the entire queue"
"I strictly use Spotify to listen to Joe Rogan, as I have another Podcast specific app for everything else. I've even used it to listen to music here and there to test if the same issues persist. The experience sucks. If I leave a podcast or song paused for longer than 10 minutes, the widget is blank when I go back to it, no song or podcast information is there. I have to open up the app again for it to populate what I'm currently listening to on the bottom ribbon. Lots of other bugs too."
"I finally switched to Spotify after years of my friends telling me it's the better service. What I've learned: 1. When you search a song, you get to listen to it AFTER Spotify plays another song from the same band first (this includes personal Playlists.) 2. Spotify wants you to pay for the ""premium"" package to listen to that song right away. 3. It's FAR LESS user-friendly than other music services. 4. If your phone is on vibrate, Music will not stop to notify you of a call. No, thanks."
"New home screen is terrible. As soon as you open the app, it starts auto-playing some random song in your headphones and there's no way to disable this. The old home screen was much more practical, showing recently played songs/playlists and featured playlists you might like. I'm not sure what Spotify user wants to scroll through random snippets of songs non-stop like it's a TikTok reel, but this ""feature"" doesn't need to be the default homescreen; move it to a separate tab."
"The app keeps adding and removing features like it can't make up its mind. There was the feature that I only saw for one day where the pinned items in my library had a separate section and it could go up to 8 pins, but it was changed back to looking like a normal list, I just removed one of the pins to add another but then the app tells me I can only have 4 pins at a time, while I actually have 7 at the moment. Please make up your mind about what features stay."
"Pretty good music app. Not too big of a fan of songs being available to listen one day but gone the next. Can be frustrating. The Music Recommendations need some work as it doesn't really suggest music I would really listen to. New Home Menu is atrocious. App has some issues that need ironed out. If I'm paying a subscription price - I'd expect the damn app to at least work properly. When connecting to Alexa App, Spotify isn't synced correctly."
The new update sucks. I have to search all the podcasts I listen to now and podcasts I've never listened to are coming up for me to listen to. Also when I do finally find my liked podcasts it shows there is a new one with the blue dot but it doesn't show up when I go to it for hours to a full day. It just sucks!! Please go back to the ways when it actually worked.
Music selection is great and premium with no ads is pretty cool. It's a real shame it only cycles through the same 30 songs even though my liked playlist has over 3000. I'm pretty sure the algorithm gears towards songs that are cheaper to play so if you like an entire album it will insist on playing the intro piece most often. The app also has a habit of being trapped on one queue and only playing the same songs in the same order over and over again.
"I dont like how i cant just choose a song and listen to it. Instead i have to wait through 8 songs (excluding my skips so 14 technically) just to get to it. I cant even put a limited amount of songs on my playlist. If i want 5 songs, i should be allowed to have 5 songs. Instead you add like 20 more songs i dont like/never heard of. This app needs to change this to get 5 stars. The one good thing is that they have the song. (Which is expected) this app is pretty sucky."
"I use an SD card for my music. The system works fine. It moves it from internal to external without issue. The problem I am constantly running into is when I power off and on my phone, my entire entire downloaded music selection is no longer downloaded. Apparently, this has been a problem for a while that still hasn't been bothered to fix. The app works great! But this small issue is becoming more of an inconvenience as it uses up my data. Please fix!"
"Terrible if you're paying money, can't leave the app alone for two seconds without it crashing in the background, and for $10/month I know there are better streaming services that can actually stream while outside of the app on your phone. Pretty pathetic for a paid service, but as far as a free music player goes, it's okay."
"I have been using spotify for about 6 years or more now and I have been using spotify premium for about 9 months or so. first, the app will not let me change the icons to any of my playlists, and I can't even listen to specific genres whenever I click on my liked songs now!!! please fix this!!! it really sucks because your app is one of the better apps to use for music but now it's just starting to suck like the others."
"The only use for this is JRE. The interface is overcrowded and not adjustable. The system of ""radio"" that is actually a playlist is trash. Songs get put in that are so far from the feel of it like metal in a Portishead ""radio"". The whole online/offline switch that you have to go back and forth on to use internet or downloaded music is an unnecessary pain. They lie about the premium free trial and still play ads. Relogging and reinstalling fixes nothing. Not enough room for all the problems"
"Assuming the app works (it crashes on a new phone), it should be able to sort podcasts already played accurately. Sorting unplayed does nothing, played ones still show, and having podcasts I've already listened to autoplay while driving is disruptive. How such a huge company can have this issue is sad. I pay for premium, while I'm glad for no ads on music, other than downloading Playlists, I'm not thrilled at the value. Great music, interface is fine when it actually works. Wishing for better."
"I've been a premium member of spotify for years without issue, but in the past year the mobile app has become extremely cumbersome. I constantly have connection issues with multiple devices, sometimes I can't connect to my bluetooth speakers with the app despite being connected on my phone, and the absolute worst has been the Android Auto aspect. Spotify RARELY works as intended with Android Auto. I have reinstalled both apps, cleared my cache, rechecked all my connections. It just doesn't work"
"Glitches abound. My primary problem is the option to have audio continue when Spotify is in the background doesn't work. After 10 or so minutes the audio cuts out. I then have to bring it to the foreground and press play. Extremely annoying while driving. Also, ad free isn't really ad free. Every single time I open the app I have to click off of some full page advertisement for some feature or album. I cannot resume unless I click off of it. That. Is. An. Ad."
"Honestly, I used to really love this app, but now it's just been really buggy lately and my phone says everything is up to date and I have one of the newest Google phones so it's kind of weird. Sometimes the song plays. Sometimes it doesn't and I have tried resetting my internet both on the router and on my phone. So I don't understand why this app has to be that way and it's just this app not the other apps. Everything else pretty much works lol. Paying pretty much for a glitchy app."
"I like spotify. It's a good app. The maneuverability is good on pc. However, there is a huge issue with the phone version. You can't play a specific song, only that song shuffled with other songs. You can't skip through a song. You can't loop a song. When you favorite a song, and click on it in liked songs, it only plays a snippet of the song. Playlists are always in shuffle mode and i can't turn it back to normal. I've tried everything, with no luck. Please fix this."
"Not what it used to be. Each update seems like a step backwards. Update: My original review was vague and done with a bit of malice. Spotify has a great selection of content, including lesser known artists and interesting creators to listen to. However without premium the mobile app pales in comparison to the desktop version. While I understand they are a business, It's hard to support the practice of removing features from the free version instead of bolstering the paid service."
I can't find a way to provide any other feedback. The last UX changes in v8.8.18.509 are terrible. I understand the end goal of wanting to be more in line with tik tok and/or Instagram. But this is not helpful when browsing music. The biggest complaint is the stopping at every single playlist/album and auto playing. The scrolling should be smooth so I can quickly get up and down the options. Additionally it hard to read the text on the thumbnails. They need to pop more.
"Spotify was fantastic before the update. Now it stops playing in the background constantly, crashes & needs to be restarted, won't allow me to access the music it's playing from my lock screen or pull down page more than half the time. Homepage is impossible to navigate. Plus, so many other issues that are beginning to drive me absolutely crazy. Please. Just go back to how it was before & just fix the old bugs. You HAD something solid. Now I'm looking at other options, & I have premium."
"The new UX is terrible. It's impossible to find what I'm looking for, and it slows down my phone considerably. I want Spotify to be an app that I open, find something to listen to, and go. Filling my entire screen with just one item at a time (and a video at that) is annoying, and inefficient. I was already looking for other options that better support artists, but now I literally have no reason to stay with Spotify if it takes 5 minutes to find something to listen to"
"My experience with using the app is not the same since redesign. I am no longer able to quickly find the music and artists that I love listening to. But all discovery has been limited to a single column, endless scroll like every other social media app. Update makes me want to spend less time on phone and tablet app and more on the web and desktop view that still use the old design. If anything, I wish there was an opt-out option for the new design."
It's ok. The music selection is great and the app works well enough. Trying to avoid using mobile data is really difficult. Offline mode setting is not intuitive. It is so hard to stop Spotify from using mobile data and switching back forth between offline mode is archaic. This issue has been on the Spotify community forums since 2012. I don't think they care. Can't sort downloads by artists... Why? 3/13/23: Downloads are still a total mess.
"Where'd homescreen Playlists widget go? Don't get me wrong, I love Spotify, its a great music streaming app. But I'm a little hurt, Spoty. I loved having the option to put a quick-link to a specific playlist on my home screen. I haven't been able to find that option for a couple months now. To me, it was particularly useful for when I'm driving. If I wanted to change playlists or songs whilst driving. Having a playlist on my homescreen streamlined the whole process of locating and playing it."
"Great option for music. Terrible format. Wish they wouldn't have updated the main page of the app. Now, when I'm trying to find a playlist, a short clip plays instead of just displaying the album or playlist cover. If I wanted to watch a clip, I would have used YouTube. Ruins an app I've used for many years now."
"There are a lot of issues with this app now, continuing on to this new review, I still find the UI updates pointless and confusing, I don't like all the pop-ups I get about artists I don't care about, and honestly I'm not a huge fan of most of the formatting for this app. Also, their new shuffle that adds songs is SO annoying when I'm just trying to cycle between shuffling and just playing the songs as they're ordered. Let us turn it off, let us revert back to the old UI."
"When fully functioning, Spotify is a great way to discover new music and collect all of your favorites in one spot. On android, this is not the case. Many of the buttons take a while to respond or are completely unresponsive. The settings menu often doesn't load, and trying to open the menu for a song fails with an offline error, even when connected to wifi. Consider looking at alternative music services. Edit: Auto play randomly stops working too"
"Hate the update. I love Spotify and have been using it for years. But this morning I opened it and it was a weird screen full of videos. I kept scrolling to try and find my playlists but then when it continued I figured I just must be on the wrong screen. It wasn't. It was the home screen. Honestly, this is very annoying. I don't want clips or videos. I just want music."
"the app overall is... fine, if you have premium. the recommendations, in my experience, are absolutely terrible, and need a dislike feature, but it's fine. until the new update, where it will shove music into your face, automatically playing it even if you try to keep scrolling. even from blocked artists. i don't have enough characters to describe how awful it is. i wish i could go back."
Why did you ruin the home page?! I liked listening to the mixes the app would make. Now I can't. I also don't appreciate my ears going deaf when I scroll down to browse and music blasts in my ear at an inexplicably higher volume than my podcasts. There doesn't seem to be a way to stop that preview play. I am very displeased with these changes and highly disappointed that they messed with something that didn't need fixing.
"Queue failure Whenever Spotify connects to a different speaker (car, phone, headphones, etc) it loses the queue. It will either play a loop of the same 4 songs, end after 2 songs have played, or suddenly start playing songs based off one of the last songs played. I have uninstalled and re-installed, but nothing seems to work. There is no point in having a Playlist anymore because it just repeats the same songs over and over. I pay for premium to be able to use my playlists but can't."
"the new tiktok style layout is highly inefficient and bothersome. it's a waste of screen space. i just want to see a list of my podcasts, playlists and recently played albums. and i really really don't want random things to start autoplaying on mute while i'm scrolling. i wish there was a way to select what style of layout we want. i would opt for the old style."
"I've experienced the app shutting down in the middle of podcasts, several times. I've experienced the app not responding at times to a purchase. I've experienced having to Uninstall and install more times than any other app I have. I've stopped using Spotify. I'm using Amazon music. Much easier to navigate. So many ads. Amazon is structured so much better. Now you know."
"Was 5 star, but the new homescreen is virtually unusable. Absolutely terrible. The massive blocks waste a bunch of space and make scrolling a nightmare, not to mention that I now have to tap an extra button to see the things that would have already been at the top of the homescreen anyway. This view provides zero utility to the user while simultaneously making it harder to find things. Bravo, Spotify."
"I've used Spotify for years, never had any big problems with it. Then they completely changed the home layout, your own playlists and resently played don't show up there anymore. Neither do the 'made for you' or 'daily mixs' playlists either, in fact I not sure if they're a thing anymore. Now what's there are popular albums, pop hit playlists and genre playlist suggestions that are only vaguely related to your taste. It's absolutely horrible! It's so bad I might stop using it completely."
"I've previously had excellent experiences with Spotify and have had premium for years, but the most recent update makes the mobile app nearly unusable. The ""my library"" and ""search"" tabs have not changed, but the home screen has turned into a nightmare of TikTok-inspired auto play. A heads up to people who are looking for a place to find study podcasts or music - go to YouTube until someone figures out how to reverse this feature."
"I've been using the premium version for years and no problems using it in my car. In the last three months the app is glitchy at best. Every other day it displays Spotify appears to not be working ony cars android enabled media player. I've done everything from uninstalling, allowing all permissions to even rebooting my cars entertainment module. Still plays music, but I have to control it from my phone while I'm driving. Please fix or I will cancel my subscription."
"Used to be a great app enjoyed it alot but now it always pauses randomly, shuts off the podcast or playlist, and doesnt put me back to where I was so i have to go through the video to see where it kicked me off nd its been like this for about 2 years now. It got really annoying so I switched to youtube since i get ad free videos and music for 10$ a month. Plus the music selection is far superior than spotify. They need to fix the bugs that are riddled within the app its not worth the money!"
"When it works, it makes a good alarm clock - when it works. Many times I get the Android default alarm then AFTER I turn it off Spotify kicks in! When I want to listen to a song, I have to go through (or skip over) a zillion other songs I DON'T want, then 30 seconds of commercials for things I don't want. Some ""songs"" are actually albums or channels, so you're conned into listening to music you had no intention of hearing! Why pay for something that you wouldn't give more than 2 stars for free?"
"Used to love it, but i hate the homescreen now. Not a fan of the extra space used up by the videos and things to scroll through. Why can't this be a setting you can change? Where did the recently played go? It's a lot harder to find what you were just listening to. Please change it back or give us an option to pick! We all loved the regular set up!"
"What is going on with spotify? It drops after one song. I have tried to uninstall it and reinstall it and still having the same issue. It seems like Spotify has an issue at least three four times a year. About to just go to YouTube music and just drop Spotify. UPDATE: 3/27/23 Geez another issue with spotify. SHOCKING! Seems not matter what I do in settings on both my phone and Spotify, it runs in the background. Constantly. So I never can go back to the last song I listened to"
"The new update is terrible. I'm a premium member, and ever since this app updated, it has ruined my listening experience. Before, you were able to see your daily recommendations, playlists made for you based on your likes, it was just easier to find your favorite artists or bands. Now, the main page just has ridiculous recommendations, playlist that have nothing to do with what you wish to listen to. If you want to listen while driving just forget it, now you can't choose an easy playlist at all"
"I loved Spotify until the last update. I can't see what songs are in a Spotify-developed playlist anymore, and the videos on the home screen are obnoxious and bothersome. I'm currently in a Spotify-developed playlist, but I can't get back to the option on the overall playlist to like it and add to my saves; I can only access the current song. There is less content available on the home screen now because every block takes up so much space. This design is far less user-friendly. Please revert!!"
"while this app is a great and convient way to listen to millions and millions of songs at the palm of your hands, there is always be some cons to this app as well. my problem with this service is the ads, of course. ""wanna break from the ads?"" ""thanks to listening to spotify, no really."" yeah, its one way to make money for record labels and the company, (a win-win situation.) but it happens so often. it annoys me. Update: I cannot turn off shuffle and its really annoying. YT to MP3 is better."
"This app is great if you have constant internet access but if you download your music and use offline mode the app does not function well, which is super annoying. Also not a fan of the new feature where it plays clips of songs at you if you scroll through the homepage-- it would be fine if you could turn off autoplay, but I havent figured out how to do that yet or even if its possible. Reminds me of 2005 when you'd get a random loud song when you clicked on someone's myspace."
"This used to be a 5 star app. It was the go to for free music apps. If you had enough songs on your list it would just play the songs you like with a few commercials sprinkled in. Since the removal of the shuffle button, that is no longer the case. It's now no better than it's competition as it now forces ""songs you may like"" down your throat trying to get you to upgrade to premium. This will not make me pay, it'll just make me look for a new music app."
"I love Spotify and have been using it for years, and havent had major complaints in a long time, but this latest update to the new home tab UI is awful. Being forced to scroll down a list of what are essentially music reels is unpleasant and hides a lot of the content I liked to see before. I used to find a decent amount of radio, artist or playlist recommendations along with recently played lists, without being forced to actually view and hear them individually. Please revert this change"
"Everytime I like play a playlist or an album it shuffles it, most of the time that is alright but whenever I listen to an album, I want it to be inside order, I also hate how you are only aloud to have a certain amount of skips per hour, and because you can't choose the song it's really annoying, another thing I hate is that when in a playlist/album you can't choose the song and you have to search it up to directly play it. You are better off on your computer than your phone."
Got the Disney/Hulu/ESPN bundle only to be very disappointed. Disney has a great selection of content but the buffering is unbelievable. ESPN was nothing but a bait and switch with the NHL playoffs. Constant buffering also an issue. Hulu was the best of the three and worth keeping. The content selection is excellent and it worked almost flawlessly.
"Good content, but not a great platform. I live in a rural area and have slow internet - no problems watching Netflix, HBO, Amazon prime or Hulu - but most of the time when watching a show on Disneyplus it will freeze part way through and never start again. I'll have to restart the episode, and it will have forgotten where in the episode I was or sometimes even what episode I was on. Constant errors when trying to cast shows from my phone to my tv, again, on other platforms this is no problem."
"Enjoy the shows, but when casting to Chromecast it will buffer throughout and won't stop until we rewind 10 seconds. Very inconvenient when the kids are watching something and we have to keep stopping the buffering. Didnt happen until about the start of this year. Reached out to customer service, they said there's nothing they can do."
"It's actually quite impressive that the app sucks as much as it does. Episodes are out of order, you can't skip the intro, when you can skip the intro it actually skips too much, auto-play randomly stops working, and the quality randomly tanks for no reason (no my internet is not the problem because I have never had that issue with any other app). Like wow, that is an impressive list of problems for a company that is an oligopoly. The episodes being out of order is the most frustrating though."
"The video player isn't very good. The competition has better players. Disney's is laggy, it crashes often and doesn't provide options like Amazon, which at any point allows you to look up info of anyone on screen, or Netflix, which is rock stable and allows you to quickly scan through frames and start playing from any part of whatever you're watching."
"Group watch has been broken for months now through several updates. If you start group watch in the app, it always starts on the 1st episode of the series which is annoying in its own right. However, if you select ""change episode"" the entire app crashes. Tried all the basic troubleshooting like logging in/out, clearing cache, uninstalling etc. So you have to start group watch, go on your TV then change it there. I also found if you change the episode after inviting someone, it breaks the group."
"Lately, the app buffers every 10 seconds during play. I'm not sure what's going on with the app, but all the other streaming apps work just fine so I know it's specific to this app. If this doesn't get fixed soon, I am going to stop paying them. The only reason for the 2 star is because of the content and organization of the content. I like the design. Please fix the buffering!"
"The app it's self is fine, but make sure if you are canceling the service, you wait to do so till the end of the billing cycle. When I realized Disney plus had gone up to $11+ after my monthly charge hit on the 15th, I canceled it on the 16th. Other apps will allow you to access your account since you've already paid for the month. But not Disney! Surprise surprise!"
"I have the app on my android tablet. I've been having the issue of the movie/show playing sound but no video. I went through all the articles to troubleshoot the issue, and it still isn't working and this is happening at home, my wifi works strong connection. I've had this issue for a month or 2 now. The app works okay on the TV. sometimes, have an issue with it buffering but not too much. But this issue on my tablet is frustrating me!!"
"A couple of times I've had to uninstall and re-install this app because it wouldn't load but now that doesn't work either; all it does is just the initial load screen before it just stops there, the little loading circle icon pausing. Edit: it is now 06/09/22, three months later, and I've needed to uninstall the app yet again to try to make it work."
"2 stars for good content. But I have a lot of subscriptions for my shows and this is the 2nd worst one. Glitch, freezes up constantly. And no small screen option. I like to listen to my shows while doing other things, not possible with this app. Really hope they make a few changes, I'd love to be able to change my rating."
"I love all the content on the app. Marvel, Star Wars are the best. But the app itself is the worst. Constant buffering. It plays content for 9 seconds and buffers for 10 seconds. A 50 minute show takes like 2 hours. I have every movie and show app on my phone. They run with no issues at all. If this app ran with no buffering it would be 5 stars. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the content, otherwise it's a 1."
"The app barely functions. It constantly tells me I'm offline, or that the video can't play and to check my connection. Hulu, Netflix and the Pokémon TV app never have issues playing. Plus you don't have the option at the credits to skip to the next episode you just have a box that doesn't work then I have to back out and try the next one (which with it needing WAY more data than all my other apps it takes 10+ minutes to start the next episode). Suffice it to say I rarely use this app due to this"
"Here, lately, the app constantly makes you sign back in. Hulu is doing the same thing. I have the bundle. I looked it up and found something about internet connection. However, it's happening on every device I stream on and at my office, not just at home. Not only does it make me sign in constantly, but it tells me my password is incorrect. I've had to change my password several times in the past two weeks due to this issue."
"I'm very glad to know that I'm not the only one experiencing this issue: It seems like the majority of users- including myself- recently have been having problems getting the home screen to load, describing it as an infinite loading screen. Before I had this issue, I couldn't watch anything, getting the ""something went wrong"" message on everything I tried to watch. Logged out, and couldn't log back in. I literally tried EVERYTHING (updating, restarting, clearing cache, uninstalling, etc)."
"It's great when 1) actually loads and 2) when it isn't constantly stuttering and buffering. It's pretty terrible on my firestick. I have to turn my wifi off on other devices just to get it to stop buffering. It now (after the last two updates) will not load at all on my phone. Just a spinning icon. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, all to no avail. 🤷‍♀️"
"The content is good, but I havent been able to watch anything for a bit. It often has trouble signing in and recently I have not been able to at all. Tried about 10 times and it would just do the loading circle for about 15 minutes when I would lose patience. Its fully updated and just doesnt work. If it was more reliable then the rating would be better"
Lags constantly but huge selection of movies and shows I love. Disney makes way too much money to have an app this laggy-it's embarassing. And it's annoying enough that I probably wont renew when that comes up if it hasn't been fixed. I'd rather just buy the movies and have them play properly. It feels like I've gone back to the 2000s when YouTube first started and the videos stopped to buffer every two minutes.
"It's requiring a full bio page to be filled out, per profile, and won't let us watching anything until it's complete. This is a media streaming app, you don't need a birthday, gender, and email for every individual profile. Those are good *options* for someone to be able to fill out if they want, but we should be able to skip it if we don't want to give out all of that information."
"Good content, but recently I've been unable to load the app. It gets stuck on the opening page without entering the actual app. I reinstalled, restarted, etc, to no avail. Their help desk couldn't resolve the issue. Seeing that my five other streaming apps work fine, I will likely cancel my membership, as the technical issues with this app render the content unwatchable."
"For the most part the content is good, but there are some shows that are not so great. Overall I like the choices available. My issue is with the app itself. Long load times and sometimes the app will just freeze altogether. Streaming is difficult. If you can get the app to actually work semi correctly, deleting downloaded shows have a very hard time deleting when no longer needed. The app needs some major TLC from the IT guys at Disney. I just want to be able to watch what I pay for. 😩"
"I do love the content of the app, it's functionality that is not very good. It constantly buffers. Plays for about 20 seconds, then buffers for a few seconds. It does this no matter what I'm watching on the app. Not one of the other streaming services I have; like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Peacock, or HBO Max, do this. I'm watching on data 99% of the time and still the other apps rarely buffer like Disney+ does. I've tried all the troubleshooting tips but sill nothing."
"Can no longer get past the ""update your profile"" page. Force stopped the app, restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app.... My profile is full and complete, and I'm paying to be able to use this app, but I can't. It's been buggy lately anyways, taking forever to load and then stopping to load every couple of minutes... but now I can't even use it."
"I have a Samsung S21. I could never get the app to stream anything, it would pull up menus fine, but once you selected something to watch, it would load for an eternity before showing ""Something went wrong..."". Talk about frustrating! Nothing fixed it, and I tried for MONTHS. Well, today I turned off my Bluetooth connection for my hearing aids and voila, it suddenly streamed fine. Riddle me that for how it worked? Who knows.... So maybe try turning your Bluetooth off?"
"Great content but it hardly works long enough to watch a movie without interruption. I thought downloading to device would help but nope, I'm sitting here watching it stuck with loading spinner in the middle of black panther 2. Hopefully they resolve these issues cause I paid for a year and I'm stuck. I already cancelled just in case they don't fix it by the time my contract expires, but really you guys owe me one. Im going back to buying DVD because that never failed me."
"This is probably the worst preforming streaming I've used. No other app requires me to manually disconnect from casting, start the episode, start casting again and then pray it works, for every, single, episode of a show I'm trying to watch. Sure, Hulu occasionally will disconnect but only this app does it consistently for absolutely everything I try to stream. Netflix doesn't have this issue, Prime Video doesn't have this issue, HBO Max doesn't have this issue, only this app."
"PS5 app continues to crash, as well as buffering on Chromecast. I've turned off all other WiFi enabled devices and connections but it's a continuing problem. Would not recommend streaming to your tv through a device (Chromecast, Roku, fire stick, apple) because I've tried them all. Super disappointed with the steaming and mirroring features. Outside of that, if I play/stream on my phone or tablet, everything is fine. I've updated the app, uninstalled and reinstalled and still have problems."
"Second day* in a row I've been unable to access D+, even after the update. I like that they're constantly adding more, but a big problem is everyday, AT LEAST, my watchlist gets wiped. Sometimes it happens AS I'm adding more to my list. Also, my LAST review I posted here is missing as well. **Usability is VERY hit or miss. It will 'load' for a minute before going back with being 'unable to connect to D+'. Paying full price for ad free. Can't even use it most of the time."
"If the movie or show decides to play with-out having to pause and download 100 times it would be great. The selection is amazing. Just wish we could watch one movie with-out interruptions, or even better on our TV, which never seems to be able to play anything. Only platform we have this problem with, so it's not our end."
"This app is good and all, but once I got the new update, it's been nothing but terrible. The main issue is that I can't even load into the app. I've tried everything, and I tried resetting my phone, clearing the data and cache, yet nothing works. I've deleted the app but I'm still on the same loading screen. What am I doing wrong. Other than that the app had a great amount of entertainment. I just want my issue fixed. I'm the only one who's had this problem. Good app. Very little issues."
"Good app but the last few weeks, maybe longer. My entire family has had issues with Disney having to buffer movies and shows no matter what network we connect to or what signal strength we have. WIFI or 5g, doesn't matter, every show or movie buffers. The other 2 or 3 streaming programs we use on our phones have no issues on the same networks keeping shows and movies buffered. Please fix it."
"Good stuff on the app, but now I have to endure interruptions while I'm watching, as it freezes and attempts to load itself. All other streaming services that I have work fine, so that excuse goes out the window. If you're going to hike up the price by $3.00 (As of 12.8.22) then I suggest you provide better quality service."
"The two stars are for the shows. That's it. The app is slow, freezes, and closes out randomly. It doesn't play the next show automatically.. I want to like this app. I want to keep it, but for what we pay as of right now, it's not worth it. I really hope Disney is reading these comments and will make the changes that are needed!"
"This by no means a bad app however, it will simply just not load. I can tap on the app and it just sits there and load. Once, I got a error 83 code but after that it simply would not load and I tried resetting my phone, updating the app and it just does the same thing, nothing. This has hapoened for at least 2 werks and its always the same result. I want to enjoy this app but it's difficult when I can't even access it."
"It would be a 5 star review if I could actually get through a show or movie without it buffering. Doesn't matter the device, on wifi, or using mobile data. Tried everything from uninstalling and reinstalling to clearing the cache, but nothing seems to work. It's rather frustrating, and i usually end up going to Netflix or Amazon prime."
"Well you can at least get interested in a movie; watch all the setup and character building, but once the action start be ready for some hot garbage! We're talking buffering every 15-30 seconds. This is not a network issue on my end. I can pull 835Mbps routinely. This app is only streaming at 5.6Mbps tops. My stuff is all up to date and I have my Google TV set as my Streaming Priority Device. No other service has any issues only Disney+. So is it the app or the backend? I don't care. Fix IT."
"I love watching a few of its movies and series it's got to provide. But every day I'm always having problems loading anything, whether on my phone or my TV... it's frustrating that I can't even enjoy a movie with my babies without having a problem. Don't know if it's even worth having the subscription anymore."
"You should be able to download shows and watch them offline but they often screw things up to make that not possible. The latest was on an 8 hour flight, I had downloaded 3-4 shows in preparation. I opened the app on the plane and I was faced with a mandatory update to the gender of my profile. But since there was no internet, I couldn't update it and get to my movies. The screen was mandatory and there was no way past it. Unbelievable."
"This is a great app with great content, but it infuriating to me that it buffered every 2-5 minutes, and then every 45 seconds after that. I've had this issue for about a year now. Every other streaming app works, and I know it's not my internet. It doesn't do this anywhere but on my phone. Whether I have wifi, or full bars, without fail it will buffer like this. It takes about an hour and fifteen minutes to finish one episode of The Mandalorian. This is getting really frustrating for me."
"I have been a Disney plus subscriber for a while now and can say the app has its many lows then highs. I love the fact that my childhood movies are only a click away and a handful of shows that I find interesting to watch. The app itself is horrible. I don't like the fact that I can only go back 10 seconds on a show, with no option to go forward or to go to the next episode. I don't like the fact that I have to fast forward the show/movie to the end to remove from my just watch list."
"What's happening? This app used to work until a few months ago. Now everything freezes and glitches. I haven't been able to watch anything, but movies at middle of the weekend day, while holding my breath to get it to stay on. The funny part is you never miss that monthly billing withdraw though. I'll change this review when it actually starts working. If not fixed by new years definitely letting it go. Doesn't make sense to pay for something I can't use."
"I enjoy the shows and movies. However, without really good WiFi, they always seem to need to load/reload and glitches every 10 sec. Hulu, YouTube and Netflix play just fine w/o interruptions on 5G. Why can't Disney? It's annoying. It's not worth paying for. (And apparently it's not just me. I've read tons of similar complaints. You might want to get on this, Disney.)"
I thought it was just my connection seems like I'm definitely not the only one and it's not the connection that's the problem. I let my subscription run out because I can't even get through an entire movie without buffering. It buffers every ten minutes or so. Very frustrating when you're actually paying for it. I updated my phone cleaned the files and still the slow loading continues. I'll be back when Mando comes back hopefully something would be done by then.
"Disney...fix the aspect ratios! On many devices, the picture doesn't fill the screen properly. Instead of just being letterboxed on the top and bottom, it's letterboxed on all 4 sides. Then, when I try to zoom in to fix it, the picture gets cropped so tightly that you can't see 50% of the content. It's about to be 2023, and this is the kind of basic stuff that YouTube and Netflix got right over 15 years ago."
"Trying to use on anything other than an extremely fast connection is a nightmare. I tried to play a movie on my phone to listen to while I work and it constantly stopped to buffer (no more than 5 or 10 minuets at a go) . I tried to find a setting to lower the video quality and it is apparently non-existent. Usually I put on YouTube for this purpose and it plays without a hitch, but Disney can't figure out how to throttle a stream for mobile use on their mobile platform."
"While the content quality may be subjective, and the interface may be usable, I'm docking two points for one terrible feature. This app only allows access to the app when the app detects internet connection. An app, mind you, that supports downloads. This means that there is only a small window of internet speed in which the app detects enough internet to allow access to the app but doesn't have enough to make streaming the content direct more economical. 4 out of ten at best."
"Both the phone and TV app glitch a lot. I know others who have had similar experiences. The worst streaming app. It doesn't want to open sometimes, is slow, or freezes my TV. The continue watching option and accessing the episodes could also be better. It does not always save your spot or let you access the episodes easily in case you want to go back or forward. Glad they are going to make Daredevil and have added Deadpool but could use more more original content and more mature content."
"The service is very frustrating to have to use mobile, even with a very strong 5g signal, there is no avoiding a buffer every couple of minutes. Immersion is not possible, if you're okay with watching your shows and movies in two-minute clip format, this is the app for you."
"Dismal experience. With episode chunks missing from series, programs that just do not start, leaving me stuck at the Disney logo. No way to skip an episode I have already seen without going back to the first menu. The app has a long to way to go before I'll go back. Disney have the resources to make this amazing, but it's just meh. The content is always available elsewhere, so there is nothing keeping me here. Paying £7.99 for a substandard app with unreliable seasons and glitchy playback."
"The app functions well. The categories are good. What really stinks--is there is no continue watching feature, your watch list is not on the home screen, and it does not save your progress. For instance: When watching a series when open, you have to search for the series in the most horrible set up of alphabet searching, go to the season, find what episode you are on, start the episode, then fast forward to where you left off. Can't search from rotating suggestions. Must go down then left."
One of the reasons for using this app is for airplanes. But anytime I try to watch a downloaded thing I always get error code 83. Even after getting connected again. I have to delete and redownload. I found that starting a video before getting on a plane typically allows it to play but that is ridiculous. No other video player app has that problem.
"The only reason why this app even gets 2 stars is because of the available content. The actual app for Android and our Apple TV is horrible. The search function is a joke. It doesn't keep track of where you left off in a series. It's missing some functions that really should be pretty basic. I'm sure that these features will be added in future updates, but I really expected more with all the hype."
"Love Disney and love the content that is on the app...when I'm able to access it. Accessing the app on wifi is almost impossible because I always get an error message saying that it's not available in my region. I live in the US, so I don't understand why this error is occuring. In addition, I cannot get Chromecast to work if I am finally able to login. It's not my wifi because I have tested in several places and it's always the same result. This same error happens with ESPN+ too."
"Not very functional. Verizon deal starts today, but every series we watch has no content listed once you select it. Those series have already been removed from Disney Now, also, so we are just out of luck until Disney figures it out. There's a Chromecast button but I don't know if it works, based on other reviews. The page for your account info, app options, and add/edit profiles doesn't work at all, you can't click anything on it. Disappointed! Should work perfect BEFORE a deal w/Verizon."
"Nice selection of media, but that's about it. No matter what device or network I'm on, I have constant freezing & crashing when casting. Every episode I watch stops exactly 20 seconds in to buffer. It only sometimes starts at the right episode, sometimes plays an entirely different show & can't remember where I left off if I switch between the app and website. I look forward to new features down the road, but right now it feels rushed & broken. Not something Disney should be proud of releasing."
"The app experience is straight garbage. Difficult to navigate, the scrolling up and down/side to side works maybe half the time, it remembers your current episode but doesn't take you to the correct season on a series' page, etc. Casting is a nightmare. It's slow and buggy, drains your battery just as much as watching it on your phone, will stop casting randomly, and sometimes just straight up doesn't work. The content and price are great. Get some proper people to build the app please."
"Good app with a great selection of content, but the most recent update seemed to introduce a lot of bugs. I regularly have issues opening the app now (just freezes on a gray screen and never opens). If I'm watching something and quickly cwhange to another app, when I come back the video is frozen for 20 seconds or so before it starts responding. At the end of an episode of a TV show that's downloaded there's a button to Delete the Episode and Start the Next. This button doesn't work anymore."
"I love the content, but the app makes it so difficult to enjoy it. I watch it on Chromecast almost exclusively, casting from my smartphone. It takes a lot of tries to actually start streaming, I sometimes get an error, sometimes nothing at all. That's one issue. The user experience overall is poor, the app is missing commands like ""next episode"", so I just have to wait for the end credits each time. Sure, I could go into the app, manually look for my show and select each time the next episode..."
"I have used the Disney+ app on several Android devices and always had a great experience. However the app is now struggling with several issues. It has gotten very slow to load up. And is very slow to start playing movies whether over WiFi or downloaded, and usually takes 2/3 attempts to get downloads to play. It is very frustrating and I look forward to the issues being fixed so I can enjoy movies and series on my phone or tablet again."
"I will start with the positive. It has amazing content, much better than all other competitors. First negative is how slow it is. For example it feels the need to reload the homescreen everytime you go off it, even if you were on just on it which is stupid and an easy fix. Downloads take ages to download for whatever reason and are buggy. The UI is pretty rubbish. It is the opposite of slick and looks bland. I could rant for hours but I only get 500 characters. It's a dissapointing app overall."
"Movies and series are incredible, but when I tried to download movies and series this is so frustrating... How it's possible that I must wait for 30 or 40 minutes to download this... You need to learn about others similar apps and correct this process... The app it's not free every people pay to watch and have a good experience, but I just watch bad experience..."
"It never resumes play at the right place, it's very glitchy, it takes about 30s to load when you try and fast forward or rewind any program. It lacks the basic functionality of a smooth streaming site. It's shocking that such a big company have such a glitchy, clunky app."
"Finished something? Still in the ""continue watching"" section. Finished it a dozen times? Still there. Restarted and watched it yet another dozen times? Still there. Why? Because this is the only streaking platform that could not reinvent the ""remove from watch later list, all while they could not time ever the correct time for the ending of any movies"
"I appreciate the autoplay feature, but the timer has to be shorter. Or at least offer the option to adjust the time. If I put on shorts(short episodes), when it ends the timer starts which is like 15 seconds to watch a 60 second episode. Kinda ridiculous."
"Apps navigation is terrible, especially when trying to look thru all the episodes in the season by clicking on the watched history. chances are you will continue the watchd episode before getting to the list. Can't change the replay speed like netflix. Downloaded movies take ages to load and sometime needs network to work. can't load while in plane at times. movies selection are limited, hardly see any good selection recently."
"I have experienced twice Disney+ doesn't play the videos I have downloaded and displayed ""We’re sorry, but we cannot play the video you requested. Please try again. If the problem persists, contact Disney+ Support (error code 39)."" I have no issue with streaming video though. The only solution I have is to redownload all the videos. Disney please fix this bug!!"
"There is no way to remove a program off your continue watching list without going to the very last show and trying to stream that one, but that doesn't always work. I watched an episode of Cougar Town, discovered how spastic/stupid it was and I cannot remove it. Same goes for other shows I have sampled, like the tv series True Lies. Also I like the netflix option to like or dislike something--I use it remind me if we have seen the show or not. Would like to see more classic Disney movies on it"
"Streaming appears sort of working now and a little less buggy but can still completely bomb my chromecast. The huge selection of quality titles can buffer (showing a MASSIVE pop up over what you're trying to watch) for lengthy periods for no reason, so if you can watch the program elsewhere, do that! I only use this for the programmes it provides, but, I am slowly finding them elsewhere now. I plan to shut down this subscription should I find them all, this is simply to unreliable."
"The app has no HDR/Dolby Vision support. Netflix and Prime work with Dolby Vision on the same devices without issue. Works fine otherwise for me (over a very fast connection). Navigation is fine. Disney+ has very good content. However, the lack of support for HDR makes the app inadequate."
"For starters, it's not the best app I have encountered with, I have seen better on poorer websites (not going to mention these websites) and you do also have to pay for it 79£! Next that I have seen is that the surcurity trying to watch singular movies. And unessesary stuff pop up in the center of the screen, whilst trying to watch it. These are a couple of reasons why I don't use the app no more also how I gave it 2 stars hope you gather from this response to fix a few things on the app. See ya"
"A decent streaming platform with great content. My biggest grief is that the download button is randomly unresponsive. Trying to download The Mandalorian and Tokyo Revengers and for some reason some episodes work while others leave me tapping the download button without results. It just flashes and no download starts. Also, when you travel to a country that doesn't support Disney+ (like Cyprus), you can't even log in to pause your subscription! Neither in the app nor on the web page."
I really enjoy the movies and things they put on here. But the main issue I have is that there is not an option to remove things from your continue watching list. If I accidentally clicked on the show that Seven Seasons or three seasons it will not allow me to remove it from continue watching this is the most irritating issue there is.
"good shows, horrible app. takes about 15 seconds to skip forward or back 10 secs, will say it's not casting when it is, so you have to re-cast to pause or change show. will skip episodes or jump between episodes. can't get to show info from casting screen have to go to main screen and search it again to see episode list. for all the money disney has they need to throw a few more buck towards app design and functionality"
"I can't download shows, always get an error message instead. Media often won't play with Bluetooth headphones connected, but resumes just fine if I disconnect my Bluetooth headphones. These two points alone are frustrating when I want something to watch mid flight."
The ads take a minute to load. Even the app itself struggles to load across all my devices. Disney app is the only app I have this issue with. The price is is extremely high for an app that has trouble loading and you have to watch ads. I will finish the month I paid for and update before canceling
"Unacceptably bad tech support. No substantial progress in fixing the app's bugs. Dolby Atmos sound never worked on my Android TV, while the Netflix app it works fine. At least until recently, Dolby Digital 5.1 worked. Now the audio has been downgraded to simple stereo. It's not a problem with the TV or the soundbar as the rest of my apps, Netflix, Cosmote TV etc. work normally with Dolby Atmos or Dolby Digital 5.1 audio."
"For a multibillion company, this app is poop. If you don't opt for autoplay, it is such a pain to try and play the next episode when casting. You have to manually find the series and scroll to the next episode and choose it. If I want to watch downloaded episodes on the move I have to choose the episode and lock then unlock my phone for them to play. Why?! Also this app seems so buggy when casting. Please fix this."
"A fairly buggy app around what you'd think to be its core function: playback of content. Seems to descend into perpetual buffering whenever you happen to push a button it doesn't like, such as to skip the oddly mandatory recaps and intros."
Streaming issues... While using 5g and wifi every few seconds/ minutes it will buffet then start playing again... Already paid for the year.. disappointed I can't use it without issues.... Movie selection is wonderful tho... Update... Still does it but now it's like every ten mins or so... Irritating 😞
"Design of user interface really needs a major overhaul.... UX of the app is just very poor... Not saying you should go copy Netflix, but my god just go and take a look. Sometime I have difficulty reading what's the show name. You also ought to show the film's name in original language more smartly, so that viewers can find and recognize their native films more easily. Previews are also very important, current browsing is very dull and boring. The recommendation system is useless or nonexistent."
"Good content but doesn't work well with Chromecast. Every other app I cast works perfectly, it's just Disney+ that doesn't. I have 3 different generations of Chromecast and its the same with all of them. Would be 5 stars if fixed"
"The movie and series collection is great, but this review is only for app itself. Most of the time it doesn't do its basic job of showing the content. The loading symbol is on screen for 1 min and then comes a text what says that there are some kind of problems. I'm not cancelling my subscription only because i mostly use tv or pc to watch disney."
"I like the options of movies and series and documentaries tó choose between. But its júst way too slow, and when you download something, it takes weeks tó be done, ive downloaded one season in a series. And in another serie, its still downloading one episode after weeks."
"drops service about 9 out of 10 times I try to watch a film. Loads the commercial perfectly, over and over and over. As far as playability goes it's the dead last worst place streaming site. Lucky for Disney they own about half the movies produced globally or this app wouldn't have any users. Every streaming site I've ever tried is more dependable."
"Massive issues after downloading offline videos! Before the app run fine and smoothly but the moment I downloaded for offline watch so the kid's could watch without using my data while out and about, the app is slow and very unresponsive 100% I've even taken all steps to sort this out with no way of resolving it now and can't even watch any of the downloads. Very suspicious if you ask me and this should not be happening."
"Disney could do way better. I am unable to use my data when I'm having coffee or riding in a car. I have to download everything. That's a pain. Then, if I happen to go from my phone to my TV, it does not keep track of the episode I'm on. Trying to get to the right episode on a TV, is a pain! If verizon was not paying for this, I would never use Disney+."
"This is by far the worst streaming app I've ever had the anguish of using... if it didn't have such great content I'd uninstall never to use again. No matter the settings/conditions it refuses to download anything and if I do manage to hit that sweet 100% I've waited for up to 3 days of pausing and resuming, download over cellular/wifi and anything else I can think of. It's such a shame as the content is so good!"
"Literally the only streaming service that buffers every 20-30 seconds. It's definitely not a problem with my phone service. I can go from trying to watch something on Disney that constantly buffers. To watching something Hulu, Netflix, Prime, or anything else and don't have any buffering. I can watch episode after episode and not buffer once. As soon as I try watching something through Disney it's constantly buffering every 20-30 seconds. I wish I was exaggerating but it's absolutely ridiculous."
Never had a problem with this app until recently. I can open the app and the home screen loads just fine but the minute you pick a show it just keeps loading. I haven't been able to download any new shows and the ones I can watch are the ones I have downloaded. Fix the problem!
"The interface is not ideal. Trying to go back a minute or two is almost impossible, only 10 seconds is possible and then 30 seconds delay! Really frustrating"
"This app is fine unless I want to watch something downloaded, then it doesn't work. I'm currently on wifi without a VPN and it won't work. When I have a VPN on for protection because I'm on a wifi network that isn't in someone's private home, it doesn't work either. Too many issues with this app and it makes me rethink having it often."
"Great shows however it will not auto play to the next season automatically, won't even stay on my continue watching after the first season I have to refind the show and manually go to next season.... its horrible especially if ur watching something for the first time and don't know it has multiple seasons... FIX IT!!!"
"Ever since you've added advertisements to the app, it causes my Disney+ application to crash, and I've followed the troubleshooting steps stated in the Disney+ Help to clear the cache and reset the app. Get rid of advertisements, like you used to have when the application service first started, ya greedy snakes. Used to be great."
"This was a 5 star app at launch back in 2020. But exactly zero improvements or changes have been made since then. Still no splitscreen support and no picture in picture mode or a way to control für Disney+ app running on your smart TV. Therefore I'm reducing my review from 5 to 2 stars, until they add some kind of up to date features to this app."
"I wish that there was a restart button on movies I started watching but didn't finish. It's there sometimes but not always and it's kinda annoying having to resume, then hit start over even when there's only like 3 minutes left in the movie. Also I wish there was picture in picture available"
"If you pause, fast forward 10 seconds or reverse 10 seconds, the show won't buffer at all. You have to close and reopen the app to get it to play smoothly. *originally posted this 3 years ago with 3 stars, it's just as bad or worse now."
"Dear disney people, why can i not preview what shows you have without paying. Strange that i need to pay to see what's recently released, no? Update: I upgrade the app in hopes I can preview new shows, but no still can't. Free marketing opportunity for Disney to get me back, but they can't show you what content they have without paying. Ri-di-cu-lous. Turning into a glitchy mess disney."
"TLDR: The wide selection doesn't change the fact that Disney+ is a functually useless app Long notes: I downloaded show episodes more than once for a long trip, and the app either refused to play them, buffered indefinitely, or forced exited (because it wanted an online connection for offline episodes). In addition, the interface isn't streamlined and functions worse than early days Netflix. Its only saving grace is the large selection of shows/movies."
"Streaming issue on Google TV with Bluetooth headphones (stops streaming when paired) for some Star Wars, National Geographic and Star titles, but now works for 'some' Disney titles. I'm disappointed that Disney does not make it easy to report such issues (or even get the issue acknowledged). It would be nice to add an app store developer support email (still not updated) that is valid and monitored. Apart from the above, the app and service in general seems to work fine."
"Good selection of films, series, and shorts. everything you'll need for the Disney franchise. The only downside is the Disney + App. It is not that user friendly, compared to other streaming platforms. Similarly, the online version doesn't look great either. things that can be improved are: 1- Being able to change languages in an agile way 1- Being able to add subtitles by one click without interrupting the streaming"
"I very much dislike the newest update to the Android app for Netflix. Now when I open my app, there is only a single vertical scroll to view suggested content. I have to click through my profile to select My List. The genre selections have been completely removed, so I cannot choose a movie based on if I'm in the mood for a comedy or action-thriller. With the single column scroll, there are a great number less video choices to view on the screen at once, limiting what I will choose to watch."
"Playback is good but almost 100% of the time it picks back up on the wrong episode or restarts instead of resuming. It also seems to be playing episodes out of order. It won't even consistently play the episode I click on, it'll just pick whatever one it wants, even ones I've already watched. It's annoying when, every time I pause and come back, it's a whole process every time to get back to where I just was. It's the worst out of all my streaming apps."
"Don't get me wrong, I love Netflix. I hate this APP though. Casting seems to be something that they cannot figure out. My Netflix app is the only service that has issues when streaming/casting to my Chromecast or TV and has had issues for years. It disconnects within seconds of you doing anything. Then makes me log completely back in from the starting screen every single time. It's wildly frustrating to have to do this even if I want to do something as simple as adjust the volume."
"So when I try and watch Netflix on my Roku TV, either the screen freezers or the sounds don't line up what on the screen. Sometimes, I have to reboot my TV just to watch Netflix. I only have these problems with Netflix on Roku devices. I've tried to update the software, but it keeps telling me that it's up to date."
"The new(ish) ""Are You Still There"" alert is the most annoying feature that has ever been added to an app!!! I absolutely HATE that feature, and I really hope it goes away sooner rather than later. It's due to this one feature that I will be giving a bad rating and will continue to do so until it's removed or we're given the ability to turn it off."
"I used to like the Netflix app more than other apps such as HBO Max and Disney+ because it would stream the most smoothly. However, with the latest update, I can no longer cast to my Chromecast. All of the Netflix support blames my internet, my Chromecast, or me, but despite countless reboots, reinstallations, and reconnects, Netflix remains the only app not working. I am unsubscribing and uninstalling. I don't need it with so many options out there that work."
Hard to find movies that I want to watch on the streaming service. Plus the search function is not very good it's very hard for me to find something I'm looking for. I'd rather use the Netflix DVD service because I can add things to my queue and I can search by genre which is difficult to do on the streaming. Plus on the Netflix DVD there's a lot more videos than there ever is on the streaming service
"I like options to watch from my phone and download some content, cool. But the entire reason I installed this app was to control Netflix on my tv from my phone, but 95% of the time it *will not* detect my tv. Troubleshoot, restart both devices, reinstall, force stop, put both devices on my backup network, nothing solves this issue when I'm having it. Then for no explicable reason it just works 5% of the time. All while the YouTube app detects my tv every time no prob."
"Nearly every movie or show I want to watch isn't available on Netflix. The price for Netflix goes up while the selection goes down. I miss the old days when we could find nearly any movie with Netflix. If Hell had a streaming service, it would be Netflix; a bunch of movies and shows, but nothing you actually want to see."
Netflix no longer let's me control my own light display settings. When the last update occurred my phone was in Eye Comfort Mode (blue filter). Now I can only watch Netflix in this filter mode on my phone. I have no setting to adjust and I can't even take the permission away with app settings. The update before they took away my phones ability to adjust light now they've taken my ability for additional comfort choices.
"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Often when trying to resume an episode it will kick you back to a previous episode or jump ahead to the next one, or restart the episode entirely. Sometimes when you're on wifi it won't play at all, and forget it if you don't have good signal, or plug your phone in to charge. Add on increasing problems, less worth watching content and increasing prices, Netflix just isn't great anymore."
"Latest update doesn't keep your place when you close the app momentarily, or plays the wrong content. I'll watch an episode and move onto the next, then turn off my screen. It completely restarts Netflix even if only a few moments, then goes back to an earlier episode (or even season) when I select to continue. I don't know what happened, but it is dreadful."
The new layout for the mobile version is garbage. I found the older versions better. It showed me the movie areas I liked. This new layout is just pointless. I do not care about movies coming out 4 or 5 months from now. If I wanted to know what movies happening to come out with the old app I would select the link to view upcoming titles.. now you are wasting my time with useless garbage. And you cannot revert to older versions of the mobile app. Again. Netflix is becoming blockbuster.
"I usually enjoy watching on Netflix when I do find something interesting or something I haven't watched. Though, for about a month now, when I go to play a video, the screen constantly pauses and freezes, cuts out to catch up with the audio. The audio continuously plays. It'll play okay for a few seconds before it starts freezing up. I've uninstalled it many times. Logged out. Cleared my cache & data. Turned my phone off & on and ive even reset my phone. Nothing helps."
The new update is just so messed up. What in the world have you guys done to the mobile app? I do not want to scroll vertically forever to find something to watch. I do not like it at all. This is an epic fail!! I mean you have to waste way to much time to find something. The horizontal scroll with the genres is a much better way to look around to find something that you want to watch. This new setup is excruciating! Plus time consuming and probably more adjectives. I'm very aggravated. 😡
"I have to restart my TV every time in order for Netflix to work. It just started happening a month or so ago. Once I go to a different app or turn my TV off for awhile, I'll have to restart my system, or unplug the hdmi cord because restarting the system doesn't always work then go to Netflix. When it doesn't work the Netflix logo just stays on the screen"
"Getting worse and worse each update. I find it annoying that there's missing shows/movies on the app but when accessing my account on other devices, those missing shows/movies appear... really? In addition of that, Netflix is just being more and more annoying with using VPNs now. I'm finding it hard to continuously pay my subscription (which keeps going up) anymore due to the decline in quality of Netflix."
"Used to be a great app, now your lucky if you can watch anything, I stream through my Roku TV, and half the time can't watch anything, it backs me out to the home screen, it doesn't matter if its a newer movie or an older movie, I want to be able to watch what I want when I want, why have to pay for something that doesn't half work! Get it together, I don't have issues with my other streaming apps, they work just fine! Fix your issues, getting old not getting what I pay for!"
Awful updates. Can no longer cast most of the time. Can't find my recent history easily without tapping into multiple places. My watch list is also in a hidden place. These should be accessible because people come here into the app to click on something they want to watch immediately. We shouldn't be scrolling like Instagram. Giant images of shows that I don't want to watch take up screen space. I have to manually go into set my own user settings to access what I want to watch. Please fix this.
"Can't turn off the ""are you still there"" feature after latest app update. I use Netflix to help with my insomnia and it wakes me up when it stops playing. I understand reason for it but I'm using it for downloaded shows and without continuous play, this app has become much less valuable to me. ETA - continue play keeps starting at beginning of season."
"Movie and TV series selection is good but the app is terribly buggy. When playing on your phone it skips and chops whether you're on WiFi or mobile data. I've tested on both with WiFi speeds at 800mb/s and mobile data at 300mb/s. I've restarted, uninstalled, and updated plenty of times with no fix. Also the screen is so dark you can barely see anything. Even with my phone brightness all the way up it's like watching TV on a Toshiba laptop from the 90s with a 10 nits screen. Fix it Devs!"
"I've had Netflix for years and there are so many movies I've wanted to see but it's not in English, with no option of English being translated, I have to read the entire movie. You then had the audacity to up the price when there are still movies I can only see if I read for an hour or two. Yes I've done it, but I don't want that to be my only option on an app I pay for. And there are barely any updated movies/shows. This is my last month paying for Netflix."
"TheRecently my Netflix app on my TV has started closing in the middle of watching something. $22 a month for this????? Prices are going up so that's a problem. Not only that, I can't stream all of my devices on the app. If they are all logged in, and only ONE is streaming, it won't work. You would think if they are continually raising prices, they would make sure their app works."
"The area to resume what you were watching moves around. Sometimes it's at the top. Sometimes it's below all the recommended schlock. Sometimes its allllllllllll the way at the bottom, when it ran out of genres like ""Comedy"" and ""Drama"", and instead were things like ""Strong colored women in live stage performances."" Leave it at the top, Netflix. Stop making me have to use the search button and type in my show to most efficiently resume viewing."
"I don't want to say anything bad about Netflix it's just since the new update the channel is not the same I prefer the old style but really what got to me (all the sudden there is ads) I shouldn't have to pay for a movie and get ads I can just put a DVD in my DVD player if I wanted to, but anyhow I've been with them for a while I decided it's time to move on unless hopefully something changes."
Every time I try to watch something on Netflix it always buffers then the app closes on its own. No matter which device or TV I try to watch it on it always does this. And it's only Netflix. My other streaming services I don't have this problem. I love the variety in the series and movies on the app but it's useless because I'm not able to watch anything.
"Ive never had a problem with Netflix until they started jacking the price. It seems with every rate increase, the problem becomes more persistent. The entire app freezes then takes forever to let me exit the app. I use the app on my TV but it's the same if I have to use it my phone. What are the rate increases for, exactly? It seems like you're paying more for technical issues to be added."
"If not the leader one of the best apps. Yet I find this app to start it's downhill plunge. A lot of foreign films filling spots instead of blockbuster films we pay so much for. They are running out of things to place. So adding ons of reality, foreign films, even some terrible documentaries. Netflix was a movie based start. These additions are making the app worse. Like come on, where's our theater access, like your competitors. I just see a dying app. 9.99 on other apps for theater access."
"App fails to be able to store media on my SD card. Contacted support, their troubleshooting steps were just to take it out and put it back in again, try a new card, or if thise don't work ""you will need to use internal storage to download titles from Netflix"". Plenty of other apps are working fine with my SD card, doing photos, videos, and audio, but Netflix simply has a bug and doesn't appear interested in potentially resolving the issue. Oh well. Rest of the app is, fine."
Netflix used to be a lot easier than this. I can sign up through the app and pay with my balance on my Play store. But since you're recent updates for some unknown reason I'm unable to use Play store you required a credit card debit card or PayPal. So I'll be going to one of your competitors that allows me to use the app and that your website.
"Unfortunately, I had a poor experience with the Mobile app. It shows 'can't connect to Netflix and the Retry Button' on the Home Page and the Mobile Game Page on my phone whereas the new & hot, download and fast laughs are working just fine. My connection is Great. In fact, that's the connection I'm using to make this comment. I just don't understand why."
Hello. I love Netflix and it's my first go to app for movies and shows but your new update changed it's whole lay out and honestly.....it's awful. I honestly don't like it and it sucks. I love the old layout where you can see everything. Now I can only see one thing at a time and I've to keep scrolling down. It's useless. I love the old layout where I see everything and the recommendations all lined up. May you PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK. PLEASE!! Thank you. Your dedicated subscriber. -LC
"I used to pay for 4 family members who would use it occasionally, but with the new restictions on account sharing with separate houses, the cost would be far to much for just one user rarely watching the same 2 shows, that are other platforms without the restriction. Was cheaper to buy the physical copies of the shows than pay for the service. Also the app has slowed drasticaly from what it used to be (on my main media device). The restrictions are mostly the final nail in the proverbial coffin."
"I don't use Netflix very often anymore. I can't fathom why you would have auto play as a function that you can't choose to disable. I could see that some people may want this to occur when you go to a program's page. But to not even have the option to toggle this off, if I want, makes me avoid this app. I'm sure you have a master-programmer that can figure out a way to make this basic function the choice of the customer. Fix your app and give people options to make your product enjoyable again."
"The user interface is not as good as the free movie app Tubi. The Tubi movies have old fashioned advertisements like we had on Old fashioned television so that's definitely a bummer, however the whole thing seems a little more honest, less shouting in your face look at me look at Netflix look at Netflix productions. That's a covert ad. I get the feeling that Netflix productions get overrated in the reviews such as they are, therefore I tend to avoid them. It's just not friendish."
"I cannot rate this higher despite the watch experience being decent. The most unintuitive and un-user friendly UI I have ever used, of all time. ""My List"" button is scattered everywhere. ""Continue watching"" and ""My List"" can sometimes go at the middle, most times below the suggested categories/shows that I do not want to browse. Buttons and ribbons incompetently placed against convention. Current show disappearing from the list once the last ep of the season ends."
"Netflix used to be good. Yes, there are great shows on it and they make great shows. However, the price increases keep on increasing and with the end of account sharing, I decided to delete it. If I can't even share my account with my wife or watch shows while on vacation, I don't see the value anymore. Now I've freed up so much time for social and personal persuits that I don't ever see myself going back."
"This new update is not great.. The home screen looks like instagram and its very unclear. Casting my series to the tv also does not work, I cannot see in the app that I am streaming and thus cannot pause it, change the subtitles or skip the intro. Also, it sometimes stops casting/streaming out of nowhere and have to restart everything and even then its sometimes not working.."
Since last few months my screen goes black and only audio can be heard every few days on my samsung phone. Netflix works fine on TV and samsung Tab. My phone hangs and is stuck as a blank screen with audio running when this occurs. No other action but holding down the power off button for a long time works. Some said this is due to app needing update or disabling accessibility so I did all that. But it comes back in a few days even if the app auto-updates. It is a very frustrating experience.
"The newest update is terrible! 1. The home page is now finicky - what was wrong with the previous layout? 2. I can no longer 'cast' shows onto my Chromecast (TV)! I have reset my Chromecast, uninstalled and reinstalled Netflix but the cast button is gone! I can still cast from YouTube fine, so it's not a problem with my Chromecast, it's a problem with the newest Netflix update. I only watch shows on my TV via Chromecast but now I can't! Why? Please fix this ASAP!"
"PiP doesn't work-I've tried everything. Playback doesn't resume where I left off. I can't turn off specific suggestions or genres being showed to me. I watched Stranger Things once, now it starts advertising horror films upon opening the app and I HATE horror. They said there's nothing I/ they can do except go online and individually delete episodes that may have cause the algorithim to think I love horror. Lots of annoying bugs 🙄"
Prior to the last update app was on point. Now casting to chromecast only sometimes works (works fine in all other apps) Design layout is frustrating as the top and bottom of the screen occasionally cuts off making it difficult to switch between seasons for shows. Overall it's pretty poor for a paid service.
Netflix really needs to fix their app. I can't keep restarting my phone everytime I want to watch something on Netflix simply because it has refused to play any movies or series. My phone isn't the problem jeez! Can you guys fix this stuff? It's really irritating and annoying and surprising because it wasn't like this before. So what changed? Please fix it. Thank you.
"Netflix has a plethora of issues. Biggest one for me is probably 50% of what I want to watch doesn't have good (or any) subtitles options. The app has constant bugs like clicking remove from list on a title I finished, and it bugs out and doesn't remove from list. Most annoying is even with stable and fast internet (1 gb) sometimes titles just won't load thumbnails and can't scroll to select movies. Stuck looking at only the first few titles that loaded. Switching to mobile data doesn't fix it."
"Pros: -User friendly -Elegant layout and minimal to no glitches. Cons: -The price increases, I can't handle anymore. -Since they started overriding the brightness and put a brightness controller in the app, it's almost like you need to be inside a bunker 100ft below the surface and completely sealed off with no lights, just to see the picture. Every movie or show, the picture is so incredibly dark, making it hard to see. Even when it's set to full brightness it's black screen audio books."
This was a great app for the most part but I always had issues with the pause/play/progress bar menu disappearing. Now that menu disappears the majority of the time making it impossible to start and stop and pause a show once started. Closing and reopening the app a bunch of times sometimes works but very inconsistently.
"Would be better if you fix the brightness. It's hard to watch in day time because we can't use our device brightness. Second, I can't even change my download option now into sd card slot. Since I update the app it has glitches and bug. I already installed and uninstalled it and nothing change so frustrating."
"I've been having difficulties with the stupid brightness adjuster. It says it's all the way up, but my screen seems darker than it should be. I wish you would just remove the brightness control. It's extremely inconvenient, unnecessary, and faulty."
The new app layout is dreadful. To continue watching or to find my list I need to click one of the menu options at the bottom? It's totally unintuitive and the first couple of times I spent ages trying to work it out.
"The reason I'm rating this app 2 stars is because, in the UK there's not many good shows and all the good shows are in America and you have to be in America to watch them on Netflix, why can't you just allow everyone to watch the same thing like, legacies still isn't on Netflix in the uk (England), I don't think it's fair, if you could put more American TV shows I'll change my rating."
"The new UI update is awful and unnecessary on mobile. It is not intuitive to find my list, last watched and to see any suggested shows that *I* personally want to watch. I'm not paying to have an ""Everyone's watching"" section and a ""games"" section shoved into my face."
"I really hate the redesign they did of this app recently. I can't easy find the shows I have saved and want to watch and there is so much clutter advertising all their ""hot new shows"" and stupid mobile games that nobody cares about. I ACTIVELY dont use Netflix as much anymore because navigating the app is so terrible."
"Since the last update it has stopped connecting to my Google cast. All up to date and as it should be, it just stopped working after the last app change. Other apps still cast fine so I know the device is okay. Only change was Netflix app."
"One Of Those MANY affected With Samsung Tab A8. Can't download to SD card. Amazon etc will be getting more a work out at least until the bug is fixed. No interest in working around......Content reasonable, so will revisit if this ever gets fixed."
The update for mobile is garbage. No more continue watching. Scrolling through is no longer seamless because it's trying to immediately start a trailer for everything you scroll by. Insane amount of scrolling just to see one option at a time instead of a few. It's ridiculous.
Netflix now has hardly any good shows/movies. A lot of the time the good shows/movies they have will get removed or sometimes only have 1 season. Really the only good side to Netflix is they probably have the best speed and layout of any other streaming service.
"Netflix is considered the best streaming platform ever, although the price is kinda pricey meaning too high for standard, but thankfully, i'll buy mobile version. One big problem is crashes, i'll crashes several time and it can problem with this platform"
"Recently I haven't been able to access the app on my phone. It just forever is stuck on the text ""Netflix"" when I open the app and doesn't load any profiles, shows, or anything. Other than not being able to use it whatsoever, sure yeah it's Neflix you watch shows. If you can get there first."
Not able to manage or delete the downloaded videos of different account getting error message like you can't remove this device. As no one is using the account but still it shows the downloaded videos aa they have been signed out their device. I request to slove the bug ASAP.
I struggle to support Netflix. They cancel so much so often that I don't really want to commit to watching anything because it probably will be gone the next time some vapid Netflix executive has a tantrum. At the rate going They're really going to be the first streaming platform to go blockbuster.
"phone version is criminal, why not to put all your recent viewings first and make it more like standard version when you can scroll endlesly, search, or trying to figure out settings if there are any, and what games who wanna games on netflix, why not to put music aswell, and books yeah let's read them on netflix too, please do something about it <3"
"Current update and design of the app forces me to click on the ""discover"" tab to keep watching what I've already been watching. Hardly a discovery. Why is the starting page ""new & hot"" Also the previews of the new & hot always launch with sound. Very annoying. Where I had to do 2 clicks before to start whatever I was watching I now need at least 3 + the preview always starts blaring some sound. In German there's a word for these ""optimizations"" and it's called verschlimmbessern!"
"I am slowly starting to feel like a loss deal with netflix subscriptions. They've canceled a lot of great series after a season or two, ""The Order"" being my favorite. This month's subscription is my last after which I will never give netflix a chance again."
"Welp, I wanted to confirm my phone, didn't receive the code to email. Until next day. Tried again by text, received text and opened it, ok, but the app's page for entering the code wasn't available anymore. Without resend. Repeat, repeat. Seriously??"
"Hate the new layout on Android devices. I have no idea why it's going to ""new&hot"" as the home page rather than the explore section. It is near impossible to find my ""continue watching"" so very close to deleting my subscription and getting the HBO app"
"It's a very nice movie and series app. But the fact that you can't share account with friends and family around you is just a downside for Netflix. They will lose a lot of people by doing so, but I guess thats their choice of action. If someone is new to this app (which I would be surprised), I would consider it if you are willing to pay CA$20 a month or around there. Otherwise, find a free app. I use Netflix everyday. But unfortunately it doesn't even have all the movies I want."
"Everything is awesome except the fact that the series are often cut short because ""Netflix decided not to pursue a season number # for #"" which is very annoying especially when you love what you started to watch and hope there will be more of it. It happened to me a couple of time and I really hate it."
"Great experience. But recently I have started facing an issue. Even if I am connected to good internet connection the loading screen is shown. Then I need to restart my phone. After it it works for one time. Then again same problem continues. So, now every time I want to watch something on Netflix I need to have a restart for my phone first. Please solve this problem."
The fact they don't have any way to view movies offline on Mac is outrageous in my opinion. No way to view a movie on flights or if you trespass an area without signal. I would understand if it would be a free service or a new thing. But after all this time this issue still wasn't addressed. I am seriously considering to move to another movie streaming platform only for this reason because I travel quite a lot and I use a MacBook for work. And I don't want to have to carry two laptops...
"New update is terrible! Cannot seem to watch movies without the app glitching. It will either freeze the picture while audio is still playing, freeze altogether or just randomly close the app down. Have not been able to watch a full movie in weeks without ut glitching. Netflix needs to fix asap"
"Netflix now just randomly selects an episode and starts with that, zero effort to start with whatever you last watched. touchscreen is STILL being broken, still takes 10+ taps to get control of tablet while Netflix running, and I am sick to death of it, its been going on years now. Fairly soon, my patience will be up."
The app runs fine its the company that's 2 star. Only reason I watch it is for option for downloads. It's useful for work and not many company's have it. I try my HARDEST not to get into a show on here because they're just going to break your heart by canceling it. It seems the better the show the quicker the cancel. It's annoying. Listen to the fans netflix not just the numbers. They do me Again like they did with the irregulars and daybreak then I'm out. Downloads aren't worth it.
"I am giving it 2 stars. Now, they just seem desperate. Netflix has a reputation for making good shows and then canceling it; go figure. Their app used to be simple and user-friendly but now they ""force"" you to watch shows that they made, which would probably be canceled. They added pathetic features in the app where it is head-throbbing to find where I left off. You have to scroll for eternity and find nothing. I can't wait for my family to get bored of Netflix so I can cancel."
"A bad revamp of home screen experience. If I want to remove 3 movies from My list I have to scroll down quite a lot and then click remove, and that list refreshes to the top so more scrolling. And mistake making New and Hot the default instead of old Homepage. More frustrating than useful. sometimes change should not be done for the sake of it."
"The newest UI is the worst. If I turn my screen off for a second I have to use my PIN again, and it won't go back to the show I was just watching. I have to go to my profile then my list, and scroll to frind the show I was just watching to continue new episodes. The only movies or shows available on the front page are now ""hot new shows"" or whatever. Not shows to continue. Not shows on my list. Not shows that are even recommended for me anymore."
Recently I have been having trouble with the movies and TV shows loading while trying to discover new stuff and I have updated tried turning off my phone and more and my internet is working so I'm not sure what is going on with the app because I'm not the only one who has Netflix with this issue so if you can please fix it it would be great
"In the last couple of months, the app just won't remember where I left off in an episode, even after only 5mins! Extremely annoying. Also the new layout is horrible, ugly and unintuitive."
"I've found a lot of movies and shows to be old and a little outdated but even worse not so interesting. Also when you mean to cancel a TV show, create a final episode that concludes your story line and doesn't leave people in suspense and wanting more otherwise just remove the entire show from the site to avoid upsetting your customers."
"PLEASE go back to the old interface. the new one is bloody useless. I don't care about designated survivor, it does not need to be a fullscreen banner every time I open the app. immediately fire whoever came up with this, lol"
"I don't know what is wrong with my Netflix app this day's, whenever I want to download it very slow, it's takes up to two day's before one movie can be downloaded, but if I watched it online it goes smoothly, pls you really have to work on that"
The new interface is pretty bad in my opinion. I liked the old interface better. I think you should give an option to switch the interface as you like so that people can use the interface that they feel most comfortable with.
"The app's settings are not accessible. I want to change that short video that plays itself everytime i open or close the app. I want change the time after with it asks are you still there cuz i fall asleep a lot of times. I cant take away the app's brightness control permission, i have to clear data and login again. Most apps have these settings and Netflix doesnt?"
I mean Netflix is quite entertaining and all but I hate the fact when they remove some shows that we love from our childhood which makes us feel unhappy about it. Also I hope the new update is better because Netflix just glitches every single time in every show and movie.
"There is no way to browse by alphabet or ANY sorted order. They just keep winding the same 20 movies in several different ""categories"" so I end up either watching the same stuff over and over or giving up trying to find something cuz it just takes too long to sift through the same stuff repeatedly! Not really worth the monthly subscription..."
"I like the app for the most part, but everytime I try to download for offline watching, the app keeps defaulting back to internal storage after I change it to SD card. It eats up all of my storage space for one movie."
"I love Netflix and I watch it on all my other devices just fine, but recently I can't even use it on my phone because it's glitching so much it's frustrating. I've Unstalled the app and re-downloaded it thinking it would fix the issue and it did not."
"I used to watch stuff around bedtime, but one day I touched the brightness controls and since then the minimum brightness I can set (on my android) is just too bright. So I stopped watching stuff (to avoid affecting the quantity and quality of my sleep) and unless I find a way to fix the issue, I'll cancel my subscription very soon. EDIT: managed to fix the issue by reinstalling the app. Thanks anyway for the wasted time and the fear of inadvertently touch the brightness controls again."
every time we open the app to look for something we get a few images that have loaded but the rest are just black rectangles where it hasn't loaded properly. closed and opened again and still the same. app is fully updated so I can't see what I could watch. ridiculous.
"The new app layout SUCKS. The home page no longer exists. So getting to your list is now inconvenient to get to and the continue watching is now in the explore tab. These two things are what I would prefer to see first when I open the app. But now what I first see is the new & hot tab and that is just scrolling though the trailers of what everyone's watching, coming soon, games, and the top ten movies/shows."
Does the trick but the last month top 10 is now top 6 as 78910 are just black can't click to see and that's on everyline of shows and films . I use Disney also that's great. Netflix can you sort this out ASAP because I am watching less and less of Netflix just because other platforms off stuff I like aswell. I don't wana cancel just yet fix it fix it fix it
"It honestly sucks, Been watching the same movies since before they had Netflix and it's just the same stiff that's on actual TV, I'm actually pretty sure satellite is cheaper. Movies that are newly added honestly aren't that good besides the rare one. I quit paying for Netflix along time ago as it was enhancing my depression, we need more on Netflix and a cheaper price because you literally just watch the same stuff over and over. And for me I only turn it on to go to sleep, not worth paying 4"
"After accidentally clicked the sign out button on one of the Netflix's games, this app and the Netflix's games keeps kicked me out from my account. After the problem still persisted after I wiping out the cache of the app and the games, I decided to reinstalled everything Netflix rather than just wiping out the app's data. Then I found out some of the games wiped out my saves. Not a good experience!"
"Buggy, picture freezes and subtitles still run. Has been this way for some years now. With the price increase you would think that they could do some app management to fix this. And it is not a cash issue, clearing doesn't fix the issue. Galaxy tab s8, and other devices."
"All video colors are washed out only in the app and I am experiencing this issue specifically in xiaomi devices, even after resetting the cell phone, on the other hand if we play the downloaded netflix video from torrent source ,display normal colors, please fix the app issue. I am having this issue more than 1 year but you didn't take it serious."
"Casting to Chromecast stopped working. Using the Google TV remote built into Android phones stopped working only for Netflix app on Google TV. Netflix, what is going on?! You've done something to ruin the user experience and it's appears to be a big issue based on all the recent reviews."
"The update just hit my phone and now the Chromecast button is missing. All my other apps are working just fine. I made sure all my other Google apps were updated, cleared all the data for the Netflix app, and even restarted my phone. Nothing is helping. I guess I'll just go use Amazon prime and cast to my TV 🙄"
"Too damn dark. My phone's brightness is overridden by the app brightness control. I can increase brightness of my phone, but not if Netflix is running and Netflix runs DARK. Anything happening at night on screen is just black if I'm watching in the daytime. Probably to hide the bad quality video. Please remove the brightness control and let me use my regular phone settings."
"This application on my Android tablet has stopped recognizing my Google TV, it just doesn't show up in the list of devices when I hit the cast icon. It just started doing this recently and all of my other streaming applications still recognize the TV. Anyone else having this problem and is there a fix?"
"After latest update (week of 28 of March, 2023) app will only load one movie/show before requiring the app to be fully closed before it will work properly again. Attempts to load a follow-up movie/show result in the loading wheel spinning long enough for my screen to timeout and go to sleepn does not matter which program is selected. Not a local network issue either."
"Not able to play video since one week, tried reinstalling, updating app multiple times, switched networks as well. Still the video's not playing. Download the video, however,still it doesn't Play it. Kindly fix the issue, we have been paying for the subscription but not able to use."
"It was great for a while. But for the past month watching shows from FOX and ABC, often there is blurring with it eventually getting sharp again. It happens on some movies, too. Checking my internet speed when it blurs, it's still very fast. I have no problems with this when streaming from Prime video, Paramount +, Peacock or Freevee. Obviously a HULU problem. Fix it HULU!!!"
"If you don't have full bars or your data is slow, forget about using this. On a good day this is the worst, slowest, weakest streaming platform. It takes so long to buffer, buffers frequently, and crashes a lot. Between that & not remembering your place when you pause a show, making you have to hunt for which episode you left off and where, the commercials start up everytime you hit pause. Need to rewind to part of a dialogue? You get commercials then too. Even if u already had to sit thru some."
"Recently, its become frustrating to use the app. Ive been experiencing constant playback errors with EVERY episode transition. Upon selecting a new episode, it buffers endlessly, resulting in an error. When I press the arrow in the left hand corner to return to the series/main menu; it produces a mini player that I didnt request. When I attempt to exit the mini player by pressing the ""x"" it pulls me back into the episode. These issues dont come from my end, I've done ALL the trouble shooting."
"I've had hulu plus live TV for about 6 months now. The app navigation is mostly fine but the hulu service as a whole is super glitchy and very unreliable. I've had to call customer service many times, mostly due to recordings not playing back, buffering with no end, and other glitches that come up on a regular basis. Navigating the interface is also not the best, but I'm hoping all this will get better over time... we'll see how long my patience lasts.."
"I think it's crazy that we're paying for a service that shows ads tbh, on top of that, there are almost 6 ads for one 20-minute episode. the ads are repetitive. many shows are missing seasons. I watch anime, but Hulu has lumped all the sub and dub episodes together so it's inconvenient to look for certain episodes. other platforms have the sub and dubs separate and it really just makes more sense that way. all in all, I would not use this service if I were the one paying for it."
There are so many problems. The biggest one is that the picture in picture function will get stuck on my screen without the option to exit. I have to restart my phone sometimes to fix it. Another problem is that I will choose keep watching and the system starts the episode over again so I have to fast forward to where I was. And also you have turn off the subtitles for pictures in picture because otherwise it tries to fit the words on the screen and you cant see anything. Pleaee fix
After a commercial I tried to rewind 10 seconds to watch an interesting part of the film and its keeps cutting to a commercial break every time I try to go back. I'm not sure if this is a glitch or what but it's very upsetting to have to watch 3 100 second commercial breaks and not be able to rewind. This happened over and over. Once the commercial break ended I tried again and had the same thing happen. Looks like I'm not able to rewind at all now
"Hulu has been much worse lately. This app keeps getting worse. It is constantly buffering, and the ads are ridiculous and repetitive. We use streaming services to avoid the constant onslaught of commercials that tv brings, only to be thrown right back into them. What are we paying for? Now it is kicking me off and returning me to the Prime home screen in the middle of shows-- a waste."
"2 stars for the great selection and easy to understand interface, -3 stars for barely being able to watch anything. I have a few streaming services on my phone which i stream to my TV and Hulu is the only one I have issues with, after a couple of episodes of a show it will say error and disconnect, it's constantly cutting in and out, etc and it's annoying too because when I go to reconnect it doesn't remember any of my progress on the show I was watching so I have to find my spot manually"
"Every few weeks, Hulu starts giving me error messages for seemingly no reason. It will not let me watch anything for days. Every time this happens, I try to report it to the help center. IT's only suggestions are to uninstall and reinstall the app. That never helps. If Hulu is going to operate such a glitchy, trash platform, the least they could do is hire people for their help center that actually know something. Give the the information/training to assist customers."
"Why is the app so bad for such a big and popular company, comparing to so many other streaming platforms? Or is it only bad on Androids? I use Chromecast and there's no playback function, sometimes you can't even fast forward or rewind using the remote when Hulu is casted and the only way to do that is through the phone, not sure why some shows are and some aren't like that. Whenever I watch Hulu through Chromecast, there's no ""pick up where you left off"" for your most recent shows either."
"App doesn't display correctly for 21:9 mobile devices ( seriously why is screen size still an issue with modern technology and coding? ), trying to watch golf is janky as well. Displays a year's worth of events before you can find what you are looking for, ""most recent"" is a featured hole/group instead of the main feed, mislabeled feature groups etc."
"Doesn't save my spot. I end up spending excessive time finding the spot I left off because the app didn't save it. And if th we're was a commercial break between, I have to let that run, too. My lunch breaks are often 30 minutes, and too much of that time ended up wasted on trying to get back to where I left off."
"Really don't understand why every time I start a show/movie and I pause the video and start it back, the whole video starts over from the beginning. It is very hard to continue to enjoy a show when you have to constantly have to figure out where you stopped from the last place it was paused. Update. Now, the app abruptly pauses and then jumps to another show. 🙄"
"Not the best. I really really hate that it auto plays something on live TV when you open the app. I also really despise that if you watch a show you have recorded, it auto plays the next episode but from the on demand with commercials. So you have to exit out and go back to your recorded show. Or, if you're in the middle of a recorded show and exit out, and come back, it will play the on demand version instead of the recorded. We get it, you want us to watch commercials. It's very annoying."
"I'm having issues logging in on the phone app even though I've logged in with ease on my Xbox, laptop and other devices. For some reason whenever I log into the app on a new phone it takes a million tries. Also the app doesn't save my place on a show sometimes. I noticed I've started a few episodes just from pushing play and the app plays some episodes over and over"
"Good shows that you can't find anywhere else but it laggs and crashes A LOT and I watch on my TV most of the time. One would expect better performance. Don't go in expecting to get through an entire show with no interruptions. If you do you'll be highly disappointed, while spending the next 10 minutes trying to load it up again. Uuuugggh!"
"The app works fine and plays fine, but why are the episodes of shows out of order? I'm watching a show with continuity and realize its essentially put them in random order, so now I have to restart to try to make sense of it. I can't find another way to give feedback on this issue, and searching found people talking about the same problem for lots of other shows. I'd recommend finding another streaming service."
"Works well enough that most wouldn't complain. But we should expect more from such a financially company. My biggest complaint is an offensive big where it the app simply refuses to show a titles page when on certain pages; it shows a ""weak connection"" screen _while_ streaming HD content on a very strong cable ISP connection. Somehow they've missed a very basic UI principle of checking for dead links. Not to mention all the trash content they push on users rather than focus on usable search!"
"I pay for this ap, and now there are 5 1+ minute ads in a show that is 23 minutes long. There is no option to skip the ads. I use to love hulu but am getting closer and closer to canceling my subscription. If you're going to have that many ads, you need to offer a free version of the ap. I'm very annoyed at this."
"Tired of constantly losing HULU. It seems to bug out with no warning on my TV. Also, several temporary stops due to buffering during every show. This doesn't happen with any other streaming app I use, so it's not my internet service or router... it's HULU. Actively searching for another service to put in place for live TV without going back to cable."
"Has one of the best varieties for a streaming service, but downloading shows and movies fails constantly even when connected to strong wifi or using my data. Also, the whole login and change pass bug were very annoying. I had to call Hulu to get it fixed. Their customer service was great. I just wish I wouldn't have to call to get simple issues resolved, like getting booted out of the account."
"It's ok. Not good, not great, just ok. You have to pay double just to have no ads (I wouldn't have a problem with ads...if I wasn't paying for the service) and you can't unlock add ons without paying for the full live TV sub, or at least if you can it's not very clear how. Seems like the company of hulu is more concerned with making money rather than actually keeping their customers happy."
"It's not great. It does have a good selection, but that doesn't make up for the 'problems' they're purposefully not fixing. It makes them money to replay the ads. Every time you step away, pause your show, or come back later, it's restarted the episode either before the previous ad break or at the beginning. The search bar is barely usable. The way it's organized is sloppy and confusing. They put all law & order shows behind the $80 pay wall. It wasn't before. Wouldn't recommend"
"Latest update is glitching. Like others have said, the playback is no longer smooth. I get a quick split-second break in the sound and video from every few seconds to about every 10 seconds. It is extremely annoying. The old version before the update did not do this. Just wanted to let you guys know! I'm sure it will be fixed soon and I will change the rating when we're up and running again. *Edit: the glitch seems to come and go. An uninstall and reinstall did not help."
"Just watch on your computer/TV. This app is so ridiculous about how many ads you get. Every 5-7 minutes is a 2 minute ad, and if you accidentally click on ""learn more"" it will restart the timer. I like watching om my phone for convenience, and to show my friends funny screenshots of my favorite shows. But when I try to screenshot on Hulu, it shows me simply a black screen and subtitles. Honestly, even if I wanted to steal content, I wouldn't do it from a PHONE. You can't even screenshot ads."
"The content is awesome, the issue is video playback. I can't watch a single show without interruption or the sound being out of synch with the video. I keep hoping an update fixes the issues, yet here we are and it's still happening. Not sure why this seems to only happen with this streaming service? Please fix it so we can actually watch the context."
"Keeps crashing our Chromecast. It's the only app that does it. Not happy with the organization of the app either. Difficult to navigate or find shows I want to continue because it's too busy cramming recommendations, ads, and what it thinks I want to watch to the top instead of putting what I've chosen at the top. Second star is for the content. If it ever drops in quality, this will be the first streaming service to get cancelled."
"Watching on the tv, is great. I watch mostly on my tablet at work on midnights. For the entire month of November Hulu has been intermittent and spotty. It skips within the first 30 seconds of your show and continues all the way through. I've done all the trouble shooting steps and have gotten no results. For the first time ever, I'm unhappy with this service."
"A lot of great shows, but some issues with the service. Almost every time I go to resume a show, it starts back at the beginning even though it shows how far into the show you were. That gets really annoying. Then this week all of a sudden a bunch of things I removed from my watch history months ago came back on my recent history. I remove them over and over and they won't start away. I tried on the phone app, tv app, and on the internet browser on my computer... It won't work."
"The app works fine on a PC. Fine on the PS4 and PS5. But the app for Android tablets is absolute garbage. A few months ago it would crash trying to play anything. Now it plays but audio and video pause every few seconds. It's not buffering like bad internet, but stuttering like you pressed the play button a hundred times and it's trying to process it. Other apps work great on my tablet. No issues with Netflix or HBO. The PlayStation streams Hulu just fine as well as the PC. Garbage on tablet."
"The phone app feels very outdated. The full screen mode doesn't fit entire screen (every other video apps like Netflix and prime can be stretched to fit the screen, so I don't know why Hulu can't figure it out still in 2023). Additionally, like other people have mentioned, the app doesn't track where the video was paused and restarts from beginning."
"This review is strictly for the app. This app has such bad UI. Pause button not being available in the middle is a standard. YouTube, HBO, Netflix, all these have that as a standard. When using the pop out, the subtitles take up the whole picture. When I lock my phone while streamer is playing, it does pause it but the UI breaks and I have to close and reopen the app. There's also no ""skip recap/intro"". Idk if I'm spoiled by the others but I thought Hulu was considered a big streaming service."
It's starting to get real glitchy. The movie shows a black screen even tho it clearly shows the time running out. Sometimes there is no sound. And sometimes it just closes the app all together. From the TV. The phone app works decent enough except when it won't let me back up to whatever episode I was on without a hassle. But the worst part is how loud the commercials are compared to the show like wth ffs.
"Super annoying, it will log you out without warning. You login, and the app claims the password is incorrect (it's not). Once it's changed it STILL won't let you login until you change ALL passwords on your accounts. It's stupid and irritating. At this point it's not even about security, I truly think they get some kick from messing with their customers."
"I'm extremely disappointed in this app. I signed up for a free trial, and not soon after they came out with the black Friday deal, but because I'm already in the free trial, and I can't cancel it, I won't get the 1.99/month deal. On top of that, simply because I was previously subscribed on Google play, I cannot add espn plus until next month. Incredibly frustrating!"
It has some good shows and movies but the commercials are so loud. I can't enjoy the programming because I have the remote close or in hand to hit the mute button during the commercials. The commercials are about 1.5 times higher in volume. I emailed them about it and the response was they can't control the volume of the commercials. Then raise the volume of your programming. Personally I think its a manipulation to get you to upgrade so you are commercial free.
"I've been a long time user, but I just wasted money. I really like Hulu and I have tested many new features through the years. I really enjoy Hulu Live via desktop and many of the programs that are with the livestream, but I cannot livestream or watch many shows via Roku. I don't get it, literally and figuratively. Unfortunately I will not continue with Hulu, I can pay $50 for cable, for more programs which is $20 cheaper for the same features as before."
The TV version of Hulu is absolutely terrible. Regularly crashes (and I mean all the time). Loses connection very frequently when other apps work fine. The interface is pretty terrible and definitely not equivalent to the phone version. You're charging people a fortune for the live TV plan (constantly increasing it). How about invest that profit in your garbage TV version?
Episodes don't play all the way. The app will literally go to a completely different show while in the middle of another one. I even went as far to turn off auto-play and the same thing happens. I've removed/reinstalled the app & restarted my tablet numerous times no avail. it's very annoying.
"I've tried every live tv platform & Hulu is by far the lowest on my list. They nickel & dime the hell outta you. & LOUD ADS!!! Why is there so many ads & why 🤔 I pay for no ads but they still sneak in as many as they can. I feel like the live tv guide needs an adjustment- It looks like a computer screen from the 1980's. Too much stuff bunched together and it's very hard to navigate. You can't easily get back to whatever you were watching- there's no ""resume watching"" option anywhere. Hard pass."
"Well I enjoyed my subscription until a few weeks ago when I started experiencing a hickup every few seconds when trying to watch a program which makes the programs unwatchable for me. I sent an email weeks ago and never heard back from anyone, good to know they care and value our time and money. I paused my subscription and just checked back only to find the issue still exists so I've sent a second email. If I don't hear from anyone once again I'm canceling. Rude and unprofessional Hulu!"
"Original rating from about 6 years ago was a 5, as of Sept or Oct 22 it is a 1. I can't watch anything on my tablet or cell. The shows skip every 5 secs or so and it's impossible to watch anything. I'm not sure what changed recently, but this is not okay. I've cleared the cache, deleted and reinstalled the app and still no resolved. Reading the other recent reviews tells me that it's a programming error. I really hope that someone is reading the reviews because it's a huge inconvenience. Thanks"
"HULU has become more and more unbearable. It buffers, derates, and glitches out regularly. I have fiberoptic with a top of the line router. None of my streaming apps come close to the problems I have with this. It used to be decent and is my go to for regular television. Has a lot of channel and content options (except PAC-12 Network) I can't believe I am considering trying Philo or similar. Or possibly returning to Sling which was terrible and why I picked up HULU. Maybe HD Air is better."
"For what's it's worth, I enjoy Hulu. The part I can't stand is that this is the one and only streaming platform that has a problem saving where I am in a show. Sometimes it restarts an episode when I'm halfway through and other times it will rewind 2 episodes back from where I actually am. The even worse part is that I have no problem watching ads since it's free but when I have to watch an ad before the show starts then I have to watch another ad bcs it didn't save my spot is infuriating.FIX IT"
"The past couple of weeks streaming live or recorded programing has been frustrating. The stream hesitates and skips every 10 seconds or so. This does not happen while watching through Roku. I hope this issue is fixed quickly. Most apps would reply to posts like this - but not Hulu. Apparently, customer service is an old fashion notion."
"Worked at first and worked great when it worked. Suddenly one day it logged me out. Now it won't allow me to log in with my e-mail and password and instead keeps telling me to replace my password. My TV app still works fine. My account was not hacked, and there were no unrecognizable log ins. Everything is fine but the phone app. I even uninstalled and reinstalled, and still the phone app refuses to cooperate. I searched the issue, and it sounds like a lot of people have this problem."
"The reason why I'm giving Hulu two stars isn't because of the content they offer but the quality of their app. I've had endless issues with buffering issues. I've got 1gb download speeds and I always make sure my router has the most current firmware and gets power cycled on a monthly basis. I've never had buffering issues with Amazon Prime, Netflix, ESPN+, Disney+, or Sling TV. I've had many other issues but I only have 500 words. I've stayed with Hulu only because my wife and daughter's..."
"I've been a paying customer for years now and I'm starting to reconsider my subscription. It's constantly glitching out, an sometimes I have to watch a previous episode of a show just to watch the next episode without a error popping up. Can't restart live shows & movies from the beginning anymore?! Even recordings aren't recording like their suppose to. Plust their algorithm always sucks. Stuff I don't even watch will pop up before stuff I currently watch, so I always have to search."
Hulu is not my favorite streaming platform. They compare themselves to Netflix but they are far from it. (Over-priced / Ads / Not User-friendly) My biggest complaint is the ridiculous amount of ads even with the AD-FREE subscription with Hulu+Live. Forcing Ads every 10 minutes during a show that you are not watching live is overkill. (Ie. Previous seasons). The Hulu platform is not user friendly either. It's not intuitive. They obviously didn't invest much in the application.
"Given our budget constraints and unwillingness to pay the ridiculous cable fees, we went with a couple streaming options including Hulu. We got the cheapest option, and I don't mind the commercials. I love the TV series that are offered...movies, too. BUT it is CONSTANTLY buffering and then crashing. It takes about 2 hours to watch one 45 minute episode (not exaggerating). I have tried it on every device I own in multiple locations - it doesn't matter. I shouldn't have to make sure I have 2 hours free to watch an episode of a favorite show. I really expected better from such a well-known company/business. To top it off, it's not compatible with my new chromebook. Really, Hulu? So disappointed - all the way around."
"Not an intuitive design, scrolls back up to the top for no reason and at times, doesnt display the 'Seasons' drop down menu at all. Hard to navigate without accidentally starting a show before being able to read the description. On my phone, does not respond to volume button while casting. Also no ratings (that I could find) for shows so you have to watch a show to determine if it's bad or not."
"Each update the sound gets softer. Without a cranked up Bluetooth speaker, I can't hear anything. Why can't it play in the background or with the screen off? Some shows (news, talk), I don't need to see what's going on. If you switch to another app it forgets what it was doing and must buffer again. WHY? And put the player controls back in the middle where they belong! I hit a quarter inch off and my video starts over. What sadist designed that?"
"It tells me that it has problems with the internet connection even though the Wi-Fi is just fine and it's not a ""once in a while"" type of thing. I hate that I have to pay $10 a month not get all of the TV shows or movies that Hulu has to offer and I still have to watch ads. The buffering system on this is terrible. Rather than reducing the quality it buffers to load it at the same quality, plays, then has to buffer again. Closing the app sometimes doesn't fully close it so Hulu thinks you're still watching something and it doesn't allow more than two devices at a time to stream. But, thank you Hulu for having some shows other streaming services don't offer."
"The app constantly freezes the video, but not the audio. Even after being updated. Does not matter if it is on my phone, firestick, or TV. Does not matter how strong the signal is, my phone can have full 5G and the video still freezes. For what we pay every month for this service, it is not worth it and we will probably cancel before long. Disappointing and very frustrating."
"I kept Hulu for awhile but hardly ever used it. There was only a small handful of movies and shows I was interested in and theres too many ads! As for the app itself, I hated it. I did not like the scrolling UI, and when I would click for more info and then go back, it always put me back at the top of the list, making me having to go wildly scrolling to try and find my place. It could be slow loading different menus as well. Not worth paying for."
"Got this app even though I already have Prime videos and Netflix because Hulu has shows that they don't (Power, Empire, etc). I've only had the subscription for a little over a month and in that time I was charged$4 on my ""free"" Trial subscription and have noticed that this app crashes frequently or doesn't load at all. All of my other apps work just fine on my smart TV except this one. As we speak I've been trying to get the app to work on my TV for the last 10min and it's still loading and crashing. It works right now on my phone but not TV and I just did an update on the 10th. It's really disappointing because Hulu has a lot of great shows that I like but if I can't watch them when I want, what's the point of paying over $13 for this subscription? And I also agree with the other reviews that its annoying that Hulu doesn't remember where you left off on a show. I hope Hulu really reads these reviews and make some real updates soon."
"I love the content included on Hulu, but it has become extremely glitchy. The captions are unreliable at best, sometimes refusing to display even when they're turned on. This means I'm unable to enjoy the shows almost at all. Then during the ""play next episode"" feature, it skips around all over the place. I've spoiled the ending to some of my favorite shows this way..."
"Hulu's service is stunning! In all the wrong ways though. As a personal opinion, I'd recommend that they realize how to do their job. Hopefully they'll take the time to shut everything down for a few weeks and figure it out. Please figure out how to remove add stops after the add has been watched, it's stupid to have to rewatch your adds because of rewinding. Also is it too much to ask that your service just works instead of crashing across all platforms (phone, console, and computer). Thanks..."
"I love Hulu but I'm SO fed up with it! It always has playback failures and I have to re-start the same episode several times and even though it says resume, it starts right back at the beginning and I have to fast forward to the last place it stopped. It is not my Wi-Fi connection because Netflix and Amazon Prime play just fine but with Hulu, it's the same thing everytime. So frustrating!"
"The selection of shows is this app's greatest feature. Aside from that, I prefer Netflix. This app glitches wayyy too much. You can't fast forward too far without it stalling. It'll even boot you off of shows for undisclosed amounts of time. There have even been times that I haven't been able to access anything on the app AT ALL (not on my phone, laptop, or Xbox One). Yet I seldom have streaming issues at all with Netflix. Not going to keep paying for something that doesn't work properly😒."
"Not sure what happened but, the app worked great for quite a while but, in the last few days I can't get anything to play. Tried uninstalling, turning my phone off and on, nothing. I keep getting a message saying weak or no internet connection. I have Wifi with a repeater so get five full bars no matter where I'm at in the house! My television is hard wired to the router and even that keeps getting kicked out of the app. It's very frustrating and we're considering going back to Direct TV."
"There's lots of small problems here and there, but most of them don't really bother me, however there are certain bugs/issues that really bother me. Some of those include: Shows skipping ahead a few minutes every single time you pause the show and go use a different app. This is a huge problem and should be fixed as soon as possible. Another problem is the fact that the captions don't even work. The ""auto"" option doesn't do anything and the off and on option forces you to go into accessibility settings in the Android system and enable it manually. This shouldn't be the case, the app should turn those on and off without me being able to manually do it. These two issues really bother me, and I would like to seem them fixed. The last one is the adds. There's just too many for a paid service. I would be fine with an add here or there but 5+ is just too much."
"The content is good. But the streaming is terrible. Hulu should take a page from Netflix and stream at whatever speed they are using. Netflix streams at a lower speed, saving it's customers on data usage. I can stream on Netflix when I can't connect to Hulu. Unfortunately, Netflix content is awful. Hulu, if you want my money you must fix this problem. It can be done. Take care of your your customers! Let me know if you fix this problem and I will return. Until then I am canceling."
"I've had mostly very good experiences with the app, however about a week ago the app quit allowing me to stream videos on my phone. I keep getting an error code. I contacted the help center and they had me run a connection test and said that it was too slow to stream. later I connected to my home Wi-Fi which I have been using to stream over my TV, and still the app on my phone didn't work. It will play about nine seconds of the commercial at the very beginning and then just freeze."
"I have been using Hulu Plus for about 10 years now. And it only seems to have gotten worse. Non stop ads to where it feels like there's more ads than TV. Also a very irritating thing, whenever I have to pause a video and come back to it it rewinds my progress about a minute and 30 seconds to where I have to fast forward and find my place again every single time"
"love the app! has alot of my favorite shows that i cant find anywhere else. i think the biggest problem i have (and this is a REALLY BIG PROBLEM) is that the app keeps restarting my phone. i be watching a show and randomly my phone will restart. this doesn't happen when i use Chromecast, but it happens alot when im watching on my phone. the other complaint is that there's a little too much ads on the app, but that's ok and easy to deal with, the phone restarting is not."
"I don't mind a lot of ads, but their placement is just outright annoying. You can't even start watching a show without 90 seconds of ads. Even if you JUST WATCHED a set of ads from one show, you're forced to watch another set when you switch to a new one. You're also forced to watch a set of ads when you rewind or fast forward too far (again, even if you just watched a set). They should at least limit how often ads can occur. Back to back sets are just ridiculous."
"Content is good. Functionality is not. I get the ""We're having trouble playing this title"" message about 1/3 of the time after an ad ends, or sometimes it'll just close out of nowhere. It keeps me stuck on one episode of a show, so every time I want to watch it, I have to scroll through and find the episode I was actually on. Also, the commercials are twice as loud as the show for no apparent reason."
"I love Hulu! I cancelled my Netflix just for Hulu. It's only the greatest TV streaming service ever with the best selection of shows! It saddens me that I have to give it only 2 stars, but frankly, the mobile app is terrible. If it didn't randomly close out so often and shut off every time I get a text or email, it would be magnificent. This is just a painful drag. I do hope that somehow this bug gets fixed. But then again, most mobile versions of this kind of thing are typically sub-par anyway"
"Commercials commercialscommercials Maybe it is deliberate to drive you to buy the ad-free option. It just makes me despise Hulu. It makes even Netflix seem like a good app. If you want to rewind, it triggers commercials. Fast-forward? Commercials. Not infrequently, you get to see the same set of commercials. Sometimes, you get to watch them three times in a row. Over and over and over. Yay. (It's maddening.) And avoidable. And inept programming."
No the bugs are not fixed. Downloaded app to my Samsung tablet. Signed up for the free trial. After watching it for the first few hours it would freeze up several times. Had to shut the app down and restart it to get it to work. Then I had to go back to the beginning of what ever I was watching to start it all over again. Not impressed. Gonna cancel trial and remove app.
"Just got hulu and you need this app to watch on mobile, no biggy. Except the freaking app is so broken that half the time I can't do anything. The shows won't load or they'll suddenly stop mid-episide. It rarely saves where I'm at so I have to jump around a lot. Most times, when hitting the jump 10 seconds forward or backward, it'll crash or forever load. It's a great service but the mobile app is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to struggle for 20 minutes or more just to watch a 40 minute episode. And the ads! I don't mind ads but when you've 2 minutes if ads, 5 minutes of show, and then another 2 minutes of ads it's frustrating. The ad slots are very disproportionate on the app vs computer. If you can help it, only use a computer for hulu. It's not worth the sheer broken frustration to watch on a phone."
"It just keeps getting more expensive, but they don't offer more options. They do it because they can. The WORST part is. I travel for work often, and bought a roku stick to use hulu. But I can't because you can have only 1 or 2 ""home"" locations. It's the most expensive of streaming options with the LEAST amount of usability. Hulu taking people's money and doesn't care. Such a disappointment"
I've been a subscriber for several years. In that time I have seen the quality of the product and the selection both decline while the price has increased. I recently switched from ad free to the basic account. I just watched a 22 minute anime that had 6 ads! The ad-free option for $11.99 and the ad-free bundle for $50.99 say in the small print that some videos will have ads at the beginning and end of the video! That's alot of money to spend on an app that is also making money from ads! Sux!
"I usually watch things while I'm doing something else. Everything else has picture-in-picture, I don't know why it's so far behind. When you move the window around that way, it doesn't pause my game, but with Hulu you have to do the outdated pop-up thing that's almost impossible to maintain, or shrink down to a reasonable size. -- If this was fixed, it would probably go up to 4 stars because the selection of stuff to watch is pretty good, anime and otherwise. Could be better but you do your best"
"App works fine on my phone. Nearly pointless on a regular tv. Using the Firestick and I can't get anything to actually show. I get about 5 sec of audio...that's it. No live tv. No recorded shows. Nothing. And it doesn't matter which version firestick either. I've got a bare minimum and one with all the bells and whistles. It's an app issue. The fact that I have to mirror my phone onto my tv to watch is ridiculous. Should've stuck with cable. More expensive, but more reliable."
"While there is some good content, the commercials are ridiculous!!!! For a paid app, I would expect no/less commercials. If you accidently minimize your screen and open it right back up it puts you back at the beginning of of the commercials. Plus, I can't minimize and still have Hulu playing on my phone so I can see another screen the way I can do for literally every other app I have downloaded. There are a couple of shows I want to finish up, but after that I don't plan to keep Hulu."
Works great for my phone and tablet no issues. But on my Samsung smart tv not so much. I keep getting network error has occurred when I get home from work or get up in the morning. I have checked my internet connection no issues. I can get it work sometimes if I reconnect the internet to my tv several times. Right now really thinking about canceling my subscription to it.
I subscribe to the live TV package on my Amazon Fire Stick. Since the last update there is a voice that reads/talks constantly and there's no way to make it stop. It is unbearable. Right now I am trying to watch The Handmaid's Tale and the voices keep cutting out. I'm missing half the show. This is only happening with Hulu. Every other app is working completely fine.
"Restarts episodes constantly or skippes them entirely. I don't know what's going on with this update but it is driving me crazy. I cannot imagine what how awful it would be if I had the version with adds. Everytime you connect to the tv, boom, the show starts over. Everytime you hit pause for a couple minutes and press play again, boom the show starts over."
"I've had this app for less than a month and I've had to reinstall twice. I don't know what bugs this fall update was supposed to catch and fix but this app is less functional than HBOMax. This is a horrible first impression. Good content. But that is worthless if I get the same ""video can't be viewed"" error for all of your content for over a week. And I shouldn't have to incessantly reinstall the app for the basic functionality of viewing videos on a video streaming app."
"There are a lot of ads. I accepted this, I tried to compare it to cable when I was younger. However, every time i stop watching and reopen the app (not exiting, just pausing the video and walking away) it restarts the entire episode and makes you rewatch the intro ad. Its very frustrating. Seems like they have good shows, but I will discontinue i use of this service after my free subscription period ends. Because this is not worth paying for."
"My movies and shows (EVERYONEof them) are CONSTANTLY interrupted with long periods of buffering with this app. It plays free of interruptions for only a short period of time. I've counted 5-6 interruptions during a 30 minute episode. The ads seems to be one of biggest trigger for this problem, but not the only one. At first, I thought it was my internet, but I have several movie apps on my device and NONE of them experience this problem -- at all! It's frustrating! Thinking of canceling!"
"I absolutely love Hulu itself, but this app just isn't that functional. I use Hulu in the regular browser much more often solely because it works better that way. The app itself tends to load very slowly (if at all) and once the show/movie is playing, the program tends to need a LOT of buffering time. If you're able to get the program playing, as soon as you hit the full screen button, the app crashes."
"What Hulu offers is great. However, this app is horrible. It doesn't make it easy to browse movies. Worst of all, it constantly loses where you stopped watching; often starting at the beginning or advancing to the next episode. There really is no excuse for such poor behavior from an app. Netflix and other streaming apps do this flawlessly. Hulu needs to do some work on this app!"
"I like Hulu service. The app is really terrible. I didn't give it a 1 star because it never crashes or anything like that it is really confusing to use. For example watching a tv series the current episode ends. The player just stops. There is no way to go to the next episode. The old one stays. You have to kill the app then start it again then the next episode shows. Does this both my tablet and phone. The play controls are like nothing else. Most you tap center screen pause or play, not Hulu"
"Literally can't get to ""my account"" section, app always crashes the instant I tap the user icon. This has been the case for at least weeks, and I consistently report feedback. Can't turn on autoplay, have to manually start every episode (the option to turn on or off autoplay is under the my account section). Everything else works well. Content selection is good."
"Absolutely awful. I keep the subscription because I like to have the option. Unfortunately having the subscription stresses me out. Hulu continuously raises prices, if you want to watch most things you have to buy an add-on for three times as much, if you don't have add-ons it doesn't have that many options, when I go to re-watch episodes it starts at the end of the episode so I have to rewind, there are lots of bugs & things that could be improved upon but they dont care because we pay anyway."
"The app crashes a lot, doesn't open often, and we have very good internet. It supposedly uses twice as much data as other apps which MIGHT be a good thing if it provided a higher quality picture and actually worked with consistency. If left on the same channel for any amount of time, the picture reverts to SD looking. It requires changing the channel and then going back to get an HD screen."
"The new UI is a definite step backwards. The mixture of cards and full screen layout clash horribly, and the design of the cards is amateurish - I seriously question if the designer understands UX at all. Add the fact that there are proprietary, seemingly arbitrary categories that obfuscate where I can find what I want and it makes for an unnecessarily irritating experience. It's quite counter intuitive."
"I would rate 5 stars based on the content, because I prefer most of Hulu's content to Netflix. But over the past month or so, the app has been a nightmare. Pausing a show/movie is a death trap, as soon as you come back to it, it takes either forever or never to load, always saying there was a problem. Well.. fix it!!! Also there's a horrible volume imbalance between the dialogue and the sound fx/music. Can't hear anything so you up the volume, but then the sound fx are defeaning!! Please fix!!!"
"App works for the most part. It is really frustrating that if I have to pause or leave the screen, I lose my place in the show I'm watching and it starts over from the beginning. Also what I'm watching doesn't stay ""floating"" on the screen if I have to check a text message or something else, it just closes. At least Netflix stays playing."
"I subscribe to Hulu and several times a day an error message pops up (video unavailable for your subscription. Error code BYA-403-006). I'm paying almost $45 to watch sports and it keeps interrupting my programming. Very frustrating and I don't think that I will keep my subscription. I had no issues during my free trial, but once I started paying the app sucks."
"For the most part it's a good app, but there are a few bugs. 1st is when you are watching a program and you are about halfway through it it will change on its own to another show. 2nd is sometimes when you get about 20 minutes from the end of the movies it stops playing and says this title isn't playable at this time. 3rd is sometimes it takes 15 minutes to load something to watch. And 4th the free trial cost $5.99, I've done the math and it's not free..."
"I love Hulu and all it has to offer. However, Everytime I exit the app and go back to play a movie or TV show, I have to shut my TV off and then back on in order to use the app. Very frustrating and may not continue after free trial of this issue isn't fixed. Looks as though I'm not the only person that can relate to this problem. Fix it Hulu, or you're going to lose customers real quick!!"
"I get the ad version included with Sprint and that's the only reason I give it 2 stars. There are too many ads and they are alaays the same. it's nothing but car and prescription medicine commercials. If you rewind you have to sit through ads again. How do you not have offline viewing in 2019???!!! Sometimes I want to watch shows while on the subway, but I can only do that with Netflix. It stops all the time on data or on wifi. Some older shows are not full screen and no adjustment exists."
"Pros: got a lot of content for 6$/month. Cons: don't know why they don't have a pop-out player anymore. Don't know why despite paying for the service, things are still behind a pay wall. Ads have just gotten longer and longer, used to be 30 to 40 seconds of ads, now its minutes. Biggest gripe, is that if you have to switch out of the app, then go back in in the middle of a video. There in a 90% chance, the app loses my place, and I have to watch the introductory ad again."
"The app itself is ok but it suddenly gives my phone a stream of notifications when streaming does absolutely everything. Pauses, buffers, plays, starts the next episode, loads the next episode, plays the next episode, everything. This is utterly useless at best because I can clearly see what's happening on the TV and annoying at worst for the exact same reason. It's redundant. I cannot change this setting in the app, the only option is to turn off everything, including the drop-down menu I use."
"The look of the app is nice but the functionality sucks. Sometimes the shows I save to ""my stuff"" don't save. Also the keep watching never updates so it can be impossible to keep track of what episode you're on if watching multiple programs. Doesn't allow you to pick up where you left off either which can be annoying if you're halfway through something."
"App has a lot of classic shows, that I used to watch when I was younger. The TV app is so laggy, it takes forever to scroll, and it goes to areas that I don't select, and it is difficult to get to the shows that I want to watch. Push the directional button, it takes 15 seconds to move the indicator each time. The app is pretty much unusable most of the time, because the guide doesn't load in correctly, and you can't change genre/theme. 5/13 App doesn't show correct show synopsis."
"Used to really like it, now way too many ads. After the show intro, you see some ads. That's fine. After the last update, once you are about 10 seconds into the show, the same ads repeat! That's ridiculous. This happened several times so I stopped watching. Previously I had liked this app."
"I love the service. I've recommended it to so many friends, and on my TV it works great, but this is the third time I've given up on the Pluto app for my phone. I can't watch even one movie or program without getting stuck on a never-ending ad cycle. Anytime the app glitches, it somehow results with more ads. Which just seems weird. **I'm fine with ads, to be clear - it's the price for ""free"" services, but come on. This much? This consistently? When everything else works fine? 😐"
"I understand that the app is a free streaming service. But if you are ever planning on charging for this app as a channel, ""NOT""...!!!! Every time it's time for a commercial break the app goes all whack. It buffers uncontrollably, and it changes to the live tv programming and I end up having to go back through the app and find the movie that I was watching. It does this even when I log into the account that I have setup for this app. NERVE-WREACKING.! Deleting this app if it doesn't get better."
"Just installed the latest software update, & now the on-demand shows I watch fall into a commercial loop. The show goes into commercial, & when the commercials end, the program resumes for a second or two & then repeats the commercials the just ended. B4 the update, the app had no problems. Now, it's unwatchable for on-demand programs."
"App crashes in the middle of episodes, disconnecting from my TV and losing the place where I left off watching. I have to watch extra ads just to return to where I left off. I mean, the videos I watch are free, so what can you expect from free service? The app tracks your location, so you do get locally relevant ads. If you don't like an app leeching your information, this one probably isn't for you. Don't pay for any service with how buggy the app is. My app is up to date and my phone is new."
"At first I enjoyed Pluto TV, but lately the app is a pain. I'm having difficulty hooking up, the app lags, and now it's been changing channels. I'm using the mobile app on my galaxy phone. It's bad enough that Pluto plays reruns into the ground. 10 seasons of JAG, and barely see 1 season as a mix of all the others. Same way with movies. Playing the same movies over and over and over. But the glitches are over the top. I won't be recommending pluto. Fix it"
"This app is the only app I use that constantly freezes right in the middle of the show. Constantly freezes and it takes forever for it to unfreeze. Update:: The app sticks even at a full 100 Mbps data speed. I'm not sure what the issue is but you tube, HBO Max, Prime, etc do not stick nor buffer at that speed. So, it's my conclusion that there is something wrong with the Pluto app. This includes on a tablet, smart phone and smart tv."
"Update from my previous review in November of 2022: I installed the latest version of 5. 24.1 and the live TV is still freezing up on my mobile phone. All of my other streaming apps are working just fine but I have been dealing with nothing but problems with Pluto since you upgraded it. It is more like a downgrade and I can't seem to find anyone who has sense enough to get it fixed. The On Demand works on the phone but not Live TV. Fix it, please! It is NOT my device but your software!!!!😡😠"
It has the content I was looking for but it freezes up when it goes to commercials and then just goes in a loop where it tries to go back to the commercials and plays them again and again and again on nearly every episode until it's just not worth trying to use the app. And I really don't understand apps that advertise themselves on themselves.
"It was fine the first few days, it was like watching regular TV with ad breaks. But now the ads interrupt the show in the middle of the scene. It'll go back to the show, but then go back to ads 5 seconds later! Sometimes the ads go on for 10 minutes or more! What gives? I just want to watch macgyver!"
"When switching to picture in picture mode it always changes the channel. Also, if you choose picture in picture while navigation controls are visible the video in picture in picture mode is incredibly dim and unwatchable because an overlay is still enabled incorrectly. Another issue I have is that if you use the app in landscape mode there is no way to go to the channel browser or use the search function and this is a major issue especially since most videos are watched in landscape mode."
"There's a glitch that signs the user out of the app entirely, causing the individual to have to re-sign in everytime one accesses the app. It's annoying as heck, having to re-sign in like that. Is it a glitch, bug, or an intentional implemented feature that auto sign out the user if app isn't being utilized for an extended period of time of more than 12 to 24 hours? If this is the case, why? Because as previously stated it's an annoyance. IF it's a new implementation! Get rid of it! Yeesh!"
"I downloaded this app to watch the old Top Gear episodes. That's it. I'm glad that it has most of them for free, spare the best ones. I have a few problems, however. First, you cannot close the small window that plays a random show when you open the app. Second, you cannot skip or go back an episode, you have to manually find the episode. And third, I try to watch a specific episode, it will load, but then it will suddenly skip it when I dont want it to. I'm not sure how to stop that."
"Ads programmed against us! Great idea. Poorly executed. Not only are there the SAME ads over and over and over, but it's obvious that there programming adapts to your viewing. You try to avoid a commercial and go to another channel and it will give you the same commercial and if you go back, it starts the same ad over again!!! You end up so frustrated with this app, delete!! Not worth the trouble. Great idea, terribly frustrating."
"I am also having the problem that, since the most recent update, the app suddenly changes channels with no warning. This is happening every 12 to 15 minutes and is unbelievably aggravating. The channel switches to whatever is at the top of your ""Featured"" list. If I had any interest in watching that channel, I would. I very much resent being automatically switched away from a program I'm enjoying! Please correct this ASAP."
"It doesn't seem to matter if there is an update or not. Even on Wi-Fi with excellent service, the app constantly skips and repeats and it is excruciatingly annoying. I miss a lot of content because once it catches up, it goes past the stuff that I wanted to hear or see. It is funny though, how the commercials just play right through like there's no problem. Y'all need to pump up the juice. My phone is a relatively new Galaxy and should not be a part of the problem. So it is you"
"Live channels play fine on my device, but it is impossible to watch anything on demand. Any video selected either plays really choppy, like a few frames a second and is completely unwatchable. Or when launching the video on fullscreen, it completely crashes my device. Great selection of shows that grows constantly, but the playback glitches just make me search elsewhere to watch."
"Too too many ads and you have to uninstall it to shut it off. ...the latest is the movie stops half way thru and keeps looping the ads so you cannot finish the movie....I would like to have hope that you will not give me an excuse but fix these problems.....don't mind the ads but hate not being able to finish the movie....my suggestion is scatter the ads thru the movies. Great Movie,""THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES""...Never saw it when it came out....a lot of fun."
"App. was alot better before the newest update . Now it changes channels just for touching the screen or by swiping down the taskbar , it is very annoying . Im using an android version of the app. . Please fix , it is getting irritating . Also the image quality went down from a high quality to a 480p . This is not improving the app. in any way . It is going backwards ."
"Not useful. I've tried saving playlists at least five times. Each time it is there until I watch a show. Then I only have a watching category and no longer have shows saved as watch later. It completely deleted them. I don't have time to search for shows every time, it's too time consuming."
While there is a ton of variety some seems questionable at best. A singular channel for the trash the Asylum puts out or the garbage that is Cheaters seems like the standards are slipping. Plus the 30 seconds of show or movie then 2 minutes of commercials gets old fast. But seriously if you don't mind shows in 30 second increments or 3 to 5 ads each break for Paramount + this is definitely the app for you.
"Free not easy. There are a lot of things to watch. Most of them are commercials. I have no problem with commercials except when they repeat up to 4 times in a row before the show goes on. Random resets and full stops add more frustration. If free is the way, then there are more stable options."
"The playback goes black screen for no reason, sometimes just freezes and some audio continues, if I get a phone call, it goes back a few minutes to what I've already watched and cannot fast forward, and the lengthy commercials are a grand nuisance. It's not my phone (Galaxy 23) and I'm on 5G UC, and on the last update, so ...... Pluto TV, it's your app. I want to like it, but it needs work."
"I used this app back in 2015 & was amazing. Unfortunately, I deleted it due 2 not enough space on my tablet since I use it for gaming, music, & internet browsing. Today, I decided to reinstall it & everything changed (obviously normal for apps to do). Watched a few shows & decided to watch a movie I haven't seen in decades. It lagged so much through out the movie, every 10 minutes, it'd stop, switch back to the show I was watching, then switch back to the movie where I left off. Uninstalling it."
"2 Stars: One for the ability to actually watch things for free. The other for the variety of things to watch. Lacking 3 stars for 2 reasons. 1- I was watching a series this week and then Pluto TV took away half of the series (the good half too). 2 -I can't pause or fast forward or rewind the videos. If I do, the video will endlessly loop back to where I paused, rewound, or fast forwarded. The video will play for a bit but will always loop back to where I stopped it. Can't finish the episode."
"If there weren't issues, I'd give it 4 stars. But I'm having the same issue as others. It randomly starts whenever in the movie. Causing me to try to find my place. Only to have to watch the same horrid ads 4 times. It took me an hour and a half to watch 22 minutes of a movie and I gave up. I'm ok with ads. Because I understand that's how we get great free content. But it's impossible to watch anything when it constantly starts over randomly or jumps forward randomly. I'm deleting. Fix ur bugs"
"If you ever have to stop a show on Demand, technically the application saves the spot where it thinks you were last. However it glitches back to that spot after every commercial break. And every time you try to fast forward to the spot you were at before the glitch, it goes into a commercial break and then glitches back to the same spot where the application thought you were. The commercials are horrendously repetitive as well. Let me fast forward to where I was!!!!"
"Bad app. Consistently has playback issues. Most commonly, it saves a point in an episode and keeps reverting back to that point. Now, I can't even fast forward. The ads need to replay from trying to go forward past an ad break. If I just suck it up and let them play again, it reverts back to the saved point anyway and I am stuck behind ad breaks I have already seen two or three times now. Ads are fine. But having terrible playback that keeps rewinding BEHIND the ad breaks is very annoying."
Really like this app. But since I updated a couple days ago. It rewinds on demand all the time. There was 30 mins left in my movie. It. Was rewinding every minute or two. And every time it would replay adds. And do it again. I wasn't even able to finish the movie. Does it on shows on demand too. Super disappointing and aggravating
"I cannot begin to tell you how frustrating this app is. I decided to watch John wick chapter 3 and it has skipped back to this one particular scene more than five times, regardless of where I was in the movie. The ads are beyond annoying, but I deal with them because it's free. The skipping back to the same spot over and over again??? I was thinking of trying to pay for premium but God knows if that solves the issue. Absolutely horrible app."
"Downgraded from 3 stars to 2 stars! This app used to be great and they finally added the Sonic movie I so wanted to watch, but only a few minutes in and a few long minutes of ads, and to make things worst: The movie will rewind on it's own back to the beginning! It's unwatchable at this point! Glad to know I'm not the only one having this issue with the app! I'm considering just deleting this app and finding a better alternative!"
"I still have issues with both the tv app and Android app. It rarely stays signed in on either for more than 2-3 days. Its annoying as all get out to keep having to sign in. Also there's an issue with timing that causes the app to glitch. I think it's because the commercials tend to run at weird times, but the app gets out of sync with itself often. If you change the channel and change back it works but it's also annoying. Sometimes it's just stuck on the Pluto screen."
"I would give more stars but I have not been able to watch an entire movie yet. I pause or do anything like turn on cc after a movie has started it jumps back. I restart, it continues to go back to the scene that it was paused on. Even if you watch another 35 minutes it will jump back to the scene that was paused. I'll forward the movie back to the 35 minute mark where I just was, it will let me watch some more of the movie then again jump back to the original paused scene. It's frustrating!"
This app has been terrible. The playback is plagued by ads cutting in and out then the show restores 20 minutes earlier. Sometimes it will get stuck in an ad and replay it multiple times only playing 10 seconds at a time before stopping. Sometimes if you resume the show it will only play 10 seconds or so over and over no matter if you try skipping ahead or restarting. I don't mind the ads if the ads played correctly without making the whole program fail.
"As I am writing this report the ads are playing. Way way too many ads. I've tried to watch the Pelé film and when I'm done with the ad breaks it takes me back about 20 minutes or so. When I try to skip back through, it gives me another ad break so then I have to watch the ads twice just to watch 10 minutes of the movie until another ad break. It makes me extremely angry."
"A lot of glitches. Try to watch but video keeps jumping back to beginning or other random points in the show. I have had to miss out on watching entire episides because the random jumping makes it impossible to watch. Please get this fixed. Will give it 3 stars because it is a free streaming service, if the bugs get fixed I'll give a better rating. Dropped down to 2 stars. Now the app randomly shuts down & won't play then when comes back up won't play episode that was interrupted."
This app will not let you watch a full movie with out jumping back to the beginning every few minutes. Then when you try to fast-forward to when you where you have to watch the same adds over and over . It took me like 3 hrs to finish watching the 1st John Wick movie. When the movie is only an hour and 45 minutes long. You have to fix this or I will uninstall the app .
"Very repetitive commercials with no reporting option. Constantly have to clear cache and data to fix the player repeating itself. Doing that will cause you to loose your places with things you started watching. App uses a ton of memory due to memory leaks and heats the battery up due to spaghetti coding. A very good variety of content but no sense, if you cannot watch it without jumping through hoops."
"Ok app with decent free programming, but with annoying flaws in the app, the worst of which is every couple days Favorites disappears and you're left with a loooong list of channels to scroll through. Even though you remain logged in, the favorites just disappear at random times and to get them back you must log out and then log back in again, and then exit the app and restart the app. Tech support for this issue was like a bottomless pit without the mystery and excitement."
"I have had pretty good experiences in the past and really hope I can get a response to change my stars. Lately my selections have been stopping, going back to a fixed point, and restarting. It's always close to the end. I have restarted my phone. Uninstalled the app, then reinstalled. It's happened to movies and episodes. It's very frustrating. Normally Pluto would get 4 stars with my only bit being repetitive commercials."
"I already expected for commercials with live streaming tv. But like some of the reviewers said, too much commercials. Also for some reasons, I keep getting pop up on my screen asking what type of movies I like. Even after I answered and skipped for several times, it came back again. I just couldn't get rid of it.  Also, I can't change channels and see channel guide. At first I thought it was the remote control. So I plugged in my wireless keyboard with touchpad.  for the first 15 seconds I still can see my mouse arrow,  but it went away once the show comes on. Mo matter what I do with the keyboard and the touchpad, the mouse arrow will not reappear unless I close the app and restart. After reboot, same problem again. Frustrating...  I guess this app is not compatible with the smart tv."
"This was the best. Since I've had my Note 10+, about a month, this app was working great. Why did you have to ruin it? While there was room for improvement, the new channel listing stinks. In portrait, the picture shrinks to a ridiculously small thumbnail, if you want to browse through the list while watching something else. Show info is gone. Often,the list is mostly blank. But worst... the show's are constantly buffering. Thanks for breaking what really didn't need fixing."
"Other than scrolling through, how do you search?? It's not exactly free, there are more than a dozen commercials during one movie showing. There are English subs that work for some shows but not all. Overall great access, lots of choices. No idea why people are saying that there's nothing to watch haha So much good stuff. Not easy to watch due to the plethora of commercial interruptions. The app needs more functionality; search option more detailed than scrolling, show tv menu in landscape (currently only available in portrait)."
"My review is about the app specifically, not the Pluto TV service, which I enjoy. This app is deficient in a couple of ways: It presents notifications, which can't be turned off in its settings (which are minimal). The lack of any meaningful setting controls also means there's no way to govern what notifications it shows. Also, it only plays sound while it's on screen and the phone is unlocked. This makes sense for a video-only app, but Pluto has some nice music channels I'd like to listen to while doing other things on the phone or while out walking."
"I used to think this was an absolutely amazing app. Then the commercials took over. The last show I watched had the same commercial playing every 4 minutes. I literally timed it. I'm all about the developers getting paid, and reasonable ads are fine, but it's not worth it when programs are unwatchable. Also, despite painstakingly removing channels I didn't want, they still showed up in the channel menu. It's a free service, which is great, but user experience is important, too. Will be glad to return and update my review if/when these issues are addressed."
"only been using it for a few minutes, but so far I'm very very impressed. the are a lot of channels and music, they loaf incredibly quickly and look great. there's a nice guide to find what's on. it seems way too good to be free. Edit: been using it for several months now, it buffers more than it plays video, and it doesn't pause video while it's buffering so you miss a lot of what you're watching, plus it sucks watching the stupid buffer icon more than half the time. I get it's free, but it sux"
"Yes, it's free. However, the image quality is poor, there is no search function (even for on demand movies), the movie selection is weak, and the service inserts way too many ads. A 129-minute long movie became 35 minutes longer due to ads. There is a workaround to the lack of search: you can search the movies in the Google TV app and open the movie in the Pluto TV app from the first app. Me, after watching two movies, I'm back to paying directly for a better experience and quality content."
"For the last three days I have not be able to view the app. I keep getting the message ""no connection"" but my internet is working fine. The app is not working on my TV nor phone. It really sucks because I really enjoy the app. They have improved so much from when I first downloaded it 4 years ago. Waaay better selections! I really like the recent upgrade. The only thing I would improve is adding a search feature. I hate having to scroll through ALL those channels just to get to the one I want."
"One of the best selections of content I've encountered in a free app. But the bugs on the android phone app just aren't worth it. If I leave the app, the audio continues to play. The only way to turn it off is to restart my phone. Restarting my phone everytime I'm done with the app is not worth the hassle. I will continue to use it on my Roku because it works seamlessly there. A few interface issues but nothing so annoying I can't enjoy my experience."
"I purchased a new phone recently. Everything worked great on my OLDER phone. Not so great with this newer one. Shows are skipping and repeating scenes. They end from 8 to 16 minutes early. Then it is minutes of Pluto's screen saver. This causes me to wonder how much of the show that I am missing. I understand ""free"", which is why I have no problem with the ads. However, please fix the ""skipping"" issue."
Fix the new format please. The channel up/down on the screen is too small. It lags going from one channel to the next. If you make it so you can view the full channel line up you cant scroll fast. When select a new station to watch it wont change or the system acts up and keeps flipping back and forth between station. You have to log out to correct it. Then you have to start the process again to locate the new station. Forwarding time slot not allow either. It lags.
"I loved it, it reminded me of watching shows as a kid... I think most people forgot how TV was like because I see no difference between this and my childhood, ads included....the reason for my low review however, it wouldn't close. I was done watching but the app stayed on, overlaying everything else. Then it glitched and stayed on one side of the screen, still running. I turned off my tablet and turned it back on, it was still playing. I had to uninstall to close it. Fix it please."
"The on demand feature is broken. It finds a random point it wants to skip forward (& back) to. After playing for some time, it jumps back to the same location over & over again. Even if you skip ahead to where you were, it will jump back to the chosen spot. Sometimes it plays for 30 seconds before it jumps back, sometimes it is 5 minutes. It just makes shows unwatchable."
"It doesn't have a search option in the movie tab which makes it harder to find interesting entertainment. However, some of the movies are RIP-OFFS of other movies... like ""cargo"" is a rip off of ""cars"", ""a turtle's tale"" is a rip off of ""finding nemo"", and so on. It feels very crowded too, and it doesn't seem to be able to give that much interesting content. The only parts that are really interesting is some of the live tv shows and the music area. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this app... but that is just from my experience."
Yeah it's a hell of a lot of ads but it's free. The problem is the same ad will play over and over and over and pop up so many times it literally starts to drive you insane. Also any TV app should have a sleep timer. Also I get sick of trying to watch stuff with all these repetitive ads so that's when I want to turn it off but they won't let you turn it off when it's in a commercial so you have to watch the damn ads again. This leads to a negative opinion about the company and products they sell
"As soon as you open the app it automatically starts playing a random television program that you cannot stop or pause. In fact, the app has no stop or pause button anywhere, and no way to configure the app - there are no app settings. Two stars because the app delivers what it promises: free ad-supported TV and movies. But no more than two stars because the developers play content automatically and don't allow users to have any control over the app. Uninstalled."
"I gave this two stars because one, I downloaded this app for the reason that one of my shows were advertized as being on this app, turns out its not. (or it is, and I just cant find it which leads me to IMPORTANT number 2) and two, there is no option to search for a specific title?! So in turn you must scroll through endless rows of titles just to find what your looking for, with the risk of not finding it at all. Search bars are everywhere and make using apps and websites a breeze."
"No search feature? Really?!?! That's not helpful at all. Also, if I cast from my Samsung mobile device to my TV via Chromecast, it always starts over at the beginning of the movie and you can only fast-foreward 15 seconds at a time and then can't fast-foreward through commercials just to get back to where you already were in the movie. It's really annoying, inconvenient and NOT AT ALL a good user experience. A truly craptacular user interface!"
I loved this app when I first found it. The last update changed things I saw as a plus. The screen no longer minimizes and if I have to answer a text when I go back into the app it starts me at the feature programs and I have to scroll all the way down to find my channel again. By the time I get there it's already at another commercial. Hopefully these issues will be addressed so I can give this app a higher rating.
"The resume playback option is okay as long as you aren't casting to your tv. I accept that ads come with free stuff. Whatever. But is it necessary to shove American Express down my throat? SEVEN ads in a row, SIX of them Amex. Sometimes resume playback fails and it starts back at the beginning. Forty-five minutes into an hour-long show and I can't jump to where I left off without having to re-watch every single ad break I've already had to sit through because you lock the controls during ads."
"Initially seems to be a good platform, though it is almost impossible to control. Things keep running and running! - why? There are no switches to turn things off or pause the content that seems to be running, while attempting to access the main menu. Things that are running, when the application is first opened, cannot be shut down! And no search button! An out-of-control app with no pause button or back button!- just can't turn things off and move on to something else! A huge flaw in the app!"
"PlutoTV had the potential to be an awesome source for cord cutters, but... On-demand in the app has stopped working altogether, and My List isn't working in the ROKU or web version. One of the big draws was to be able to pick movies and shows to watch later, then have them at my fingertips when ready to watch. Without that, it's just one more app with mostly the same live TV channels as all the others."
"i want to like this app, but WAY to many interruptions while watching anything. Awful commercials, played over and over; i will never support a product endorsed by Pluto just because I'm so annoyed by the constant interruptions to show the same ads, and the same ads are on every channel, and often on every station at once so you can even channel surf. with some work this could be a real cool app."
"I'm having trouble with this app. It was great when I first started using it. Now, it constantly freezes on a ad or commercial what ever they are. I have to switch it to another channel and come back to the channel I was watching only to watch a little more of the content before another commercial comes back on and freezes again."
"So many commercials! I watched 75% of an on demand movie on my tv. I had to stop and switch to my tablet. It doesn't let you skip ahead to that spot but has to show you every single commercial they've dropped into the movie to get to that point. It was over 10 minutes of commercials to get back to that point! I understand showing one commercial break, but this was unbelievably excessive. Forget it! I'll just wait until I can get back to my TV which is still sitting there on pause (thankfully)."
"The play controls on Pluto are bad. No search function. No ability to click to a specific position in the video play bar.... A LOT of ads (more ads than content at times), many of which are obnoxious. If you are looking for free movie content with far fewer ads, Tubi TV has an edge, with better control for the user.... That said, the content on Pluto is decent (if you are able to wait for it between the ads). There is a reasonable selection of news channels, TV series, and movies."
"It is OK if you are jobless and just want to spend hours on the app trying to locate something interesting to watch. There is no search or any other convenience to filter out all the trash. It is just a long list of ""channels"" and what is playing on them right now. No way to find out what is going to be playing on what channel, set reminders based on that to let you catch the program, etc., etc."
"App has been great until changes to navigating On Demand movies. If you fall asleep or walk away 3/4 of the way through a movie and it finishes playing, now you need to go back and watch commercials every 20ish minutes just to get back to where you left off. I do not mind watching the commercials while watching On Demand titles, just hate to be punished for stepping away and trying to catch back up."
"I used to LLOOOOOVVVE this app; USED TOO! I absolutely hate the update. For the sake of a pretty platform and a few new channels I've lost features. Picture-in-picture no longer works. I thought split screen would be a work around but it's not. You get no picture, audio only, when you select the other app your splitting the screen with. I appreciate that there is now a details option to see info on what you're viewing. A+ for that but I can't use the app as much now. OnDemand search pls!!"
Biggest gripe is the time bar. I tried watching a movie on my PC. Movie always kept stopping. Bad player. Tried to continue it on my phone and it's like my account doesn't carry over from PC to phone. Also can't scrub to the point I was in the movie. The scrub always stops at commercials and after the commercials are over I can't go ahead and get the error message about not being able to do it because of commercials.
"Pluto is an okay app. I love the consept very nice lay out however there really is not much to choose from in my opinion. I did watch a few things and enjoyed it as there were 3 ads total during the whole 30 minute run time, much better than 10-15 in beteween one episode of something. However, this drains your battery even if it is closed. A search bar would also be nice. For a free streaming service I am impressed with the work and I will be back again to look at it again"
"Pluto used to be a decent service, especially since it is free. Unfortunately it has become unbearable because of bugs and glitches, claimed to be internet connection issues but that is 100% false. When watching on demand movies it always reaches a point where the movie simply will not play. Have to restart the app and then the movie will not resume from where you left off. It starts from the beginning and trying to reach where you were is horrible because it stops for every commercial break."
"The screen on my tablet switches to sideways view no matter which way I turn the screen (meaning the sides are always on top and bottom so I have read sideways). Also, there is no search feature, I have to hunt for what I want and hope I come across it with my head tilted sideways. Very annoying. And I would like a way to turn the tv off when searching for an on demand movie or TV show. I absolutely would love the app and give 5 stars if these three things are fixed."
"I have had Pluto TV for a long time. I have always enjoyed the movies and shows that I find here and I do not even mind the ads. The last month or so it has been glitching at the end of programs and in either repeats the end of the program after having ads along with having more ads, or it just repeats the ads. I have found myself looking for other sources of entertainment because I am frustrated with this happening. It seems there has also been a lot of we are having trouble playing this title."
Content is fine but app has a lot of problems. I watched half of a movie and stopped it to come back later. When I came back to it the progress had reset. I clicked to where I was in the seek bar and it only let me seek to the first commercial. I understand they don't allow me to skip past them but at least save where I was so I don't have to re watch them all. There is also no search function in the app.
Love this app but it falls short in so many ways. It needs a search bar and pause and play options. It would be great if there was a way to search your show you were watching and go back to the episode you left off on. Super frustrating to watch a show and go back to the channel to be watching an entire different episode of another season and have no clue what happend in the one you were watching or the rest of the season.
Great choice of TV and movies in all categories. But the app is just too buggy to use. I tried using by downloading on my TV and everything I tried to watch kept getting hung up. To the point that I had to keep restarting the all the way to power on my set. So I downloaded on my phone and tried to cast. It wasn't any better that way. It's a shame to have such great content but not be able to watch it. I'm removing from all devices.
So many commercials it is mind numbing. The commercial breaks are very frequent ( one movie I was watching the breaks came approximately every 8 minutes) and those breaks last way too long ( some times more than 5-6 commercials per break). So like I said mind numbing. The app is also extremely buggy. There are other free viewing apps out there that are easier to use and have way less interruptions. The sheer volume of content is excellent
"Like the saying goes, ""Don't fix it if it ain't broke""...The latest update sucks...While casting, the ability to see the channels list is gone. In place of them are just up and down buttons. Functionality is greatly decreased. An 'error casting' notice keeps popping up while on Chromecast...even though nothing is wrong. Cannot access the Closed Caption button while casting...This latest update is actually a downgrade. Thumbs down!!!"
"I'm disappointed in the update. I used to love watching Pluto on my phone because I could toggle through apps while the video still played. Now as soon as I switch to a different app, the video stops all together. Why was this feature changed? Its insanely annoying. If this returns I will probably increase my score. Also don't like how On Demand goes back to Live at the end of an episode. Just go back to the episode select."
I like this app because it has a lot of the old shows that I used to watch. Content is fantastic however my biggest issue is that it keeps stopping to buffer or whatever more than it actually plays the episodes. Sometimes when it comes back it pick up where it left off but most of the time it skips and it's kind of hard to follow what's going on when it keeps stopping every few seconds extremely frustrating
It's not really free considering the time the lagging wastes of your data. Would actually be cheaper to get cable and that is expensive. Nice try; but very lacking. No way to have a favorites list. Having an account is pointless and commercials repeat often and usually get cut off. Everything freezes no matter what device you try to watch on. Poor execution of service.
"Fairly good app, for free. I used to like it much better. BUT, the show/hide channel options stopped working and also when choosing the Favorites category, no channels show AT ALL. This needs fixing asap! I watch Pluto less and less now because of these bugs. Sometimes I wonder if these are bugs or done deliberately so we are forced to at least see the other channels listed more often. And, NO search feature for the Movie & Shows section causes me to go to the far superior movie app, Tubi."
It has access to lots of good shows and movies yes. However every 5 minutes is about 20 minutes worth of the same exact commercials every time. So if you watch a movie you get more commercial time then you do actually watching your movie. Not to mention the app doesn't save your spot of where you were and only let's you fast forward about 3 minutes at a time and then you have to watch another 10 minutes commercials
"I've only used the app once and probably won't ever again. I saw that an old movie from my childhood was available so I download the app to watch it. I understand the need for ads and usually don't mind them, but they seemed a bit too excessive at points. There where ad breaks every 10-15 minutes like you'd expect from cable TV, which is understandable. But having 4 ad breaks in the last 20 minutes of a movie is just too much."
"Love and hate it, cut the cable and is a great supplement to streaming movies. Would be a higher rating but I created an account so I could create a favorite list. This serves no purpose, I placed many channel's on the do not see list(don't watch latino so no point in looking thru them). All the channel's I spent time going thru are still in my guide on the app and on my roku device. It's free but reasonable commercials, so they are getting money to improve on this."
"A free streaming service is great and all- but on the app I don't like the fact that it autoplays a random show or movie with no way to pause it. If you minimize the app or try to go back to the previous screen, it reloads the app entirely and goes back to the start screen. I already redeemed my T-Mobile Tuesday but it keeps acting like I haven't. I just hope that I can continue to get the benefit of T-Mobile Tuesday while viewing it at my desktop PC on a browser."
This app is okay (meh). It has decent shows and some decent movies but the commercials are endless and they are the same ones over and over. It feels like mind control programming to be honest I mean it's endless. They have a decent variety but if you find a movie channel or a show channel it's usually an old program. There is rarely anything really new. The app could be better and I think they could provide a better product if they wanted. Hopefully that'll change in the future
"Nice selection of programs and movies, but the user interface is rubbish. Some features aren't there despite allegedly being available, like the watchlist. Where the hell is it!?! They insist on autoplaying the featured selections, which is annoying. Search bar often disappears and requires the app to be deleted and reinstalled. And the overall appearance of the home screen is cluttered, ugly, and generally unusable. Looks and operates like a beta app, despite being years old. Needs much work!"
"Pluto TV has oodles of content to choose from. That part is great. It needs a ""back"" button or option. When using on demand, another great feature, if you want a list episodes, that page doesn't stay. You have to call it up again and again. I found that on some shows, the episodes were in the wrong order. The absolute worst is the frequency of commercials. You watch about 5-6 minutes of the episode then commercials. This repeats itself through the whole episode. It is way too many ads."
"Can no longer cast to Chromecast and use the guide at the same time. You can use the new channel up and down buttons, but if you want to use the guide, you have to press back, choose to stop casting and then you can use the guide...but when you find a different channel you want to watch, you have to re-cast it. In a nutshell: latest update is super inconvenient, and needs to go back to the way it used to work."
"Good App! However, I was watching 'Casualties of War' and there were moments when the movie stopped because it was reloading or buffering, but when it resumed playing that part of the movie had already played while it was buffering, so I missed parts of the movie because of this. Is there a way to fix this? Looking forward to your reply."
"A worse, less controllable, less functional, less watchable app than Tubi TV. Shame, could've been really really good. No option to turn off the live TV. No way to skip through parts of movies. It's just.... Not very good. Especially considering there's plenty of other apps that do it better, smoother, faster, and have a better selection."
"Pluto seems promising from the outside, but the app has several bugs, flaws, and crashes on my LG smart tv, iPad, and phone. There is no search option on my TV, which is quite awful when you want to watch anything specific. On the iPad and phone, it crashes often, requiring a restart of both the app and episode, forcing you to rewatch all of the ads while manually finding the place you left off. Again, seems promising since it's free content, but the frustration it causes might not be worth it."
"Direct casting to telly seems to be no longer available with the latest version, as is a settings option (push notifications, stream quality, etc.). I have no problems with the amount of adverts (Pluto is free, after all!) - just wish that they would allocate more of the ad revenue towards better/more servers to help with their streaming and buffering issues."
"Some good choices but WAY too many commercials! It is impossible to become deeply emersed in some storyline, (the goal of most movies), or tense, unfolding scene to have three or four full length ads per commercial break, and at least five or more times per movie. I would suggest offering an option to watch the adverts together before the movie, but it would take an hour to get through them all. I get the need for ads, but c'mon, man.."
"The selection is good, but the app is terrible at casting. Casting will cut out in the middle of an episode and force you to restart, meaning you have to watch all the ads again. The app also doesn't save your place in a series, forcing you to pick out your episode each time you start. Continuous play if a series is also iffy, usually the next episode must be selected manually."
"I love the concept and all. I spend hours a day watching it but it's getting annoying now and here's why. Whatever show I'm watching will freeze. While the picture is frozen, the audio will rewind 5 or 10 seconds and when the audio lines up to the picture then it'll play normal for a few seconds then do it again. Please fix this issue. I know it's not my phone because I had the same issue on my last phone."
"In need of some serious debugging and some algorithm rewrites. The Guide is a nice addition but the one on TV and the other one on my phone/computer are not quite in synch or even similar enough to synch. There's no channel numbers on the phone and the names of channels don't match up between the two devices. The connection on my Vizio D32f-E1 is a haphazard one at best. I've checked my end, getting 433MB/S. Pluto is constantly refilling its buffer when a good show is on but the ads never need to"
"I downloaded this app because it sounded useful. I tapped it and it immediately crashed. Tapped again, crash. Turned off all running user apps. Crashed. Tried setup wizard with two buttons that don't work. I'm not mad but disappointed. I wanted this app to work but plainly it just doesnt. I'll try again later and see if you (or I) figure it out. Two stars for now."
The first use of Kodi was great but as soon as I come out of Kodi it then doesn't open up again. I get a black screen and nothing happens until I touch the screen on my phone and I get a message from the phone either asking me to clear the cache or to update the app due to bugs.
"When you pause a video and then go to resume after a few minutes, the screen freezes requiring a restart of my nvidia shield tv pro. Tried deleting and reinstalling Kodi, but to no avail."
I use it with kodi addon pvr iptvsimple but always getting connection lost error since end of March. Same error on linux PC also not just on Android.
"Where on earth do you get the add ons that really work to get , tv , sky and free films used to be easy, not so much now , mabe i need pointed in the right direction???"
"My Nvidia Shield Media player (two) got updated recently with the latest version of Kodi. However , I haven't been able to watch any of the videos from my NAS folders. All I can see are the "".."" which obviously gets.me up one level. Had no problems with the previous version"
It's a bit buggy. Sometimes when you watch a movie and change to a different app it sometimes randomly plays the movie out of nowhere
This app does not work for my s21+. It keeps on going black screen and doesn't load. 9 out of 10 times it goes black. I Uninstall and installed several times but it doesn't work. Problem is my android box doesn't support the new version app and i had to install on my phone until I get new box. The user interface is very complicated to find and go back and forth for the content you're looking for.
"I choosen this app for MXQ Android box but found error 19 on jio tv , IPTV simple client addon also failed to to download so it is my request kindly update for remove these bugs"
"Terrible app. Crashes every single time I open it, so have to uninstall then reinstall just to get it to work."
Since updating nothing but buffering!! From no issues to now I cannot watch anything! Will have to factory reset to get old kodi version!!!
App is laggy as it doesn't allow installation of add on offered by kodi
"Since the last up date,dstv now dont work,it keeps on giving error messages, showmax,and all the other are streaming smoothly.😠 Giving it 2 stars now."
"Every GD time there's a major version update, it introduces something that causes microstutters in local videos. Why can't this just work, like VLC or literally anything else?"
"[Update] Unfortunately the current update didn't fix the below issue, so staying with 2 stars for now. I unfortunately have to agree with the negative comments. Though for me nothing broke insofar as it stopped working, Matrix has introduced an irritating behavior when playing songs from my music collection (on a NAS). Previously, when you went ""Artist"" and then clicked ""Play"" for an artist, where there are multiple albums in the library for that artist, it played album1, song1, album1, song2 ... album2, song1 etc. Basically as expected, I'd say. Now Matrix starts playing album1, song1 and then jumps to another album and another song. Haven't figured out the logic behind it so far nor did I find a setting to restore the old behavior. Which is quite annoying, as I want to listen to whole *albums*, not songs. E.g. Live albums."
Before the last update it started instantly. Since it it stops responding for quite a while on my Nvidia shield Pro.
"This app doesn't work on my Samsung S21. It just goes black right away. I've installed, uninstalled and installed again and the samething happens. Its a shame as I was touting the reliability of this app over the years. It works on my android box though. Hopefully, the app has some updates that change its reliability back to being an elite entertainment app"
"Interface to browse medias is very nice, but make an effort to improve your video player. On the Formuler TV (hisilicon) the video player is not able to path through DTS. DTS is an old codec and an old WD live tv was easily able to play it. mrmc is able to play it and seems to be a fork of KODI. With the Leia version on the same device (Formuler Z7+) video playback is sluttering sometimes and if you pause the playback and replay it, audio made gaps..."
"Painfully counter-intuitive interface and the world's worst keyboard - what is with the stupid spacing around the cursor and why on earth can't you paste text into the input field? If you have a UX team, then fire them all, and if you haven't, then hire one quickly. It is badly in need of an overhall. Update - upgraded a star for not being crippleware like Plex."
Quite hard to setup. Addons page are so confusing to navigate and I'm not sure what I should download or how should I add in contents I want. I can't even paste links I copied and have to type manually while switching between apps.
"The UI interface is fine but what bothers me is that I cannot paste anything from my clipboard into the app. I have to input everything manually - even links! Furthermore, the PVR does not want to start, it keeps loading forever, whilst on Windows, I can paste anything into the text box and the PVR client loads almost instantly (I have installed the very same PVR client/add-on both on mobile and Windows). Please give this Android port some love. Thank you in advance."
"Since upgrading my one plus eight to Android 12 about 2 weeks ago kodi died. Just a black screen. I still have my older s9 plus and it's on Android 11 and works great. I use Android TV and it's ok. Will try older versions to see. I did try one step back and it failed. Update, I just installed Kodi alone and it worked. I previously tried installing a complete all in one file Kodi with skin like I usually do screen is black. So must do some research on this."
"On my phone I open the app and only get a black screen. It will work one time (first time after installation) then no more. App it good, when it works. Works on my android TV fine."
Do not feel that Kodi need to access intense files that it does. I downloaded the app so that I could get a experience due to me not investing in cable anymore and I do not like the fact that my sensitive information could be seen as a pawn just to look at a tv app. What if I had medical information that I did not want anyone else to see.
"Usually works great for me, but now when trying to open the app it says it has a bug and won't open until the developer fixes it. Last night, I deleted the app and reinstalled it. It worked for the night, but today the same thing happened"
"Custom keyboard screws with Android TV. They use a custom keyboard, not Android's. This causes massive issues with Android TV devices, making it hard to enter any text input at a reasonable speed. Use the standardized android input field. It's there for a reason. Not only that, the app itself is a gaudy mess."
"Since the Leila update, none of my devices work properly or smoothly(S7 active, Galaxy Tab A, Fire TV box 2, Firestick 4K and have installed appropriate cpu versions for each). Seeing how others are experiencing similar issues, I would suggest to everyone to revert to 17.6, I loved this software until this past version update. I know myself and others would love to see a permanent upnp source option too."
"As a long time user of Kodi I have grown to dread updates as they usually are breaking more than they are fixing. A fresh install of the latest version of Kodi only presents a black screen on my Pixel 4 running Android 12. Swiping on the screen produces navigation sounds but 100% black screen. I have to gesture out of the app and close it. On my Nvidia Shield Pro (2019), Kodi 19.3 crashes A LOT often than previous releases. Do they even bother testing? It doesn't appear they do."
"Gave it a shot but found it wasn't like a mobile app at all. Doesn't use the phones keyboard making copy/paste impossible as well as very hit and miss when trying to enter letters, It's stuck in landscape mode as well and all together the interface is somewhat limited and clunky. A shame really as the idea is probably good, just badly executed and needs a complete re-development for mobiles."
Could you fix it so when I lock my device and unlock it the song or video is in the same spot I left it?! super frustrating especially when your listening to a long audio file and have to try to find your place all over again. doesn't seem like a difficult thing to fix!!
"Needs to be addapted to mobile. The app works just like the PC version. There hasn't been any attempt that I can see to change anything, consequently the screens are very tiny. I uninstalled it after using it one time as I can't see myself using it. Too bad, as I love the pc version."
"19 is bad when using network setup. It breaks the database migration from 18 to 19. It freezes playback on Windows in the middle of a video playing and wont play correctly on linux (i get spazzing menus while video audio is playing. Pressing any crashes). Going to test it on android and see if i get anything different. Your video player engine is unstable. With the help of the forums, I was able to fix the database issue but had to wipe it out entirely in mysql, in order to get it working."
This Android version of Kodi does not work as well as the desktop version. I found it almost impossible to select anything or to navigate the user interface. It's hard to judge the rest of the app when the U.I. is un-usable. :'( I'm sad because this is my favourite media player on most other platforms.
"The App used to work well at around v16. With update v19 the video that used to work no longer do so. E.g. I can play a short sample of a video, however the full version 5.5GB does not even start. After 30s of spinning circle Kodi bails out. VLC has no problem with the same content. This is not the first time, when between versions Kodi regressed dramatically for me. And this particular issue of large content failing has been on and off - based on googling. Looks what Kodi lacks is testing. Just get few hundred videos and make sure they play on bunch of devices before each release."
"I have been using Kodi (XBMC) on the original Xbox consoles. Eventually switched to Windows and finally a nVidia Shield Pro 2019. I shake in my shoes every time Kodi has an update, it's always what did they break in this version. So when I was running 18.x and heard 19 (Matrix) version was coming out I went into Google Play store and told it not to update my apps, fearing a total mess was probably coming. So I waited about 8 months and installed v19.3 assuming it would be a fairly solid. Well I was wrong, after installing I could no longer access any of my network shares on my Synology NAS using SMB. I jumped on the Kodi forums and found hundreds if not thousands of complaints about the issue!! Eight months and the devs can't manage to fix this!! They can't even fix the simple upgrade issue where it leaves the SMBv1 blank in the settings. After several hours of reading try this and try that, nothing worked. I finally caved and enabled NFS on my Synology, uninstalled 19.3, reinstalled to get a clean install and setup Kodi for NFS to finally get a connection to my NAS. It's unacceptable that after 8 months they can't or won't fix basic bugs on Android. The nVidia Shield and Synology DSM are major players, this is not the junk you see on eBay for $50 running outdated Android releases."
"I use Kodi everyday since I've owned the newer shield pro. I really like this app except for one thing that makes me want to switch to Plex....the scrappers for video info are completely broken since 19.3. Even 19.2 and 19.1 worked better. Yes, files labeled correctly. Folder structure, source, updated, all good. Go to add them in....oh, i only found 2 episodes from your 32 episode season. And they'll be random. Episode 6 and 20 it can find but nothing else. 99% it cant find the series."
"I can't use any PVR, it gives an error, and after a few minutes it closed and I can't open the app anymore. it's the 1st time I use this app, I'm just interested in watching online TV, but it's SO complicated... I give it 2* because the UI is really nice, otherwise 1*"
"Unfortunately, I have to agree with the negative comments on the matrix update. Having used Kodi for 3yrs now, I was okay with the previous versions until this 19.0 Matrix update; there's a serious lag in pictures when playing VOB files on my TV from my HDD. If an update is not out I will have to embrace other players"
"I've been using Kodi for many years on my PC, so I'm quite familiar with operation. Works fine on Android as long as it's in focus. It CRASHES within 15 minutes of being put in the background, either by invoking the home screen or by going to any other app. Yes, I've disabled battery optimisation and any Kodi screen savers"
"I have a Samsung Galaxy S21+. I just recently downloaded Kodi and it was working fine for a few minutes then I switched to another app and when I switched back to Kodi all I got was a black screen. I can hear the sound swishing whenever I hit the back button but the screen is black. I uninstalled and reinstalled, same issue. I hope this can be fixed soon. (Edit: it works at times but sometimes if I leave the app and come back it'll be just a black screen)"
"Very useful app with plenty of features and add-on potential. Sadly, this is let down by not supporting 120Hz high refresh rate. Just gets stuck on a black screen. Makes it a pain to use. Please can this issue be addressed?"
"For music it completely sucks. You can create playlists but don't add the wrong song or forget a song as you will not be able to edit, even though there is an edit option. It's hard to find and get to the playlist once you exit the add. Once you find the playlist again it's impossible getting it open as everything you tap on it the page goes to something else and if you click on anything on that screen it won't load."
"It's full of bugs, crashes, desync issues, lags and hangings. Seems like it's a price for such a high customization possibilities - you must be so lucky to get it work stable depending on your hardware and OS."
Very confusing to setup. Unintuitave and too many places for different settings. If they ever simplify or amalgamate all settings into one interface this could be a rockstar app. Also it always downloads the wrong metadata which is a BIG problem. Seems no way to only use filename and insists on using bad data hidden in the files themselves.
"Since the version 18 on android, some format are not playable anymore one in particular is .AVI. in v18 it won't allow you to point to a different player like VLC to play them like it did in 17. If you have TV episode or movies that are in AVI stay away from version 18 or 18.1, version 17.5 and 17.6 had no issue"
Was so happy with it at first. Now it says channel unavailable for no reason. The mythtv back-end working fine and front-end fine but kodi can't even play previous recordings without saying channel unavailable. The old recordings are there and correct and play on mythtv front-end and raw on the host just fine.
"Kodi was working great on my Galaxy s20 ultra then all of a sudden after opening the app, the screen is black and it doesn't work at all.I'm sure it just needs an update and I will change my review once it's fixed. Normally this is a great app for us."
New 2019 Android system update causing glitches in Kodi and other entertainment apps involving video video playback and internet downloading can you help? video plays for 3 seconds stops refuses to buffer or cache you have to manually press pause then playto get it to play and it Plays 3 seconds and freezes again. I found this to be so across-the-board and not only with Kodi but other Google apps Yahoo Google Play it did happen right after downloading the update from Android.
"With the latest update the app is noticably slower, lagging just to load the next menu screen. Since the update I've also noticed some ambient noise in the background while the app is running."
Won't load any online media. Media on my phone loads completely fine. When I connect to online repos and then try loading media then nothing happens. Also change the keyboard to the phone keyboard. The one on Kodi is hard to use. I understand if it's used on console or firestick but on phone it's useless and it stops you from being able to paste in URLs so you have to type them in.
Sloooooooow. Uninstalled within a few minutes due to app hanging while trying to navigate round folders to build a library. I don't like having a pop at open source but testing seems a weak point; this is a basic usability fail.
"I was using 18.9 on a Samsung tablet and everythig was fine. Version 19 does not support my PVR for WMC. I wish there was a way to configure Kodi so that it does not auto update. True, when updating apps in play store I can manually disable the update but if I miss doing this I have to completely remove 19.x and reinstall 18.9. Sometimes the latest and greatest are necessarilly the best for everyone. If it ain't broke, leave it alone."
This version is buggy. I noticed when trying to open this app it goes all black but when I tap on back button then I can hear the back sound in the app. Also clearing the cache doesn't do much at all either. I have samsung galaxy tab s7 plus.
It may have tons of features. But it sucks at doing basic things like playing a video stored on phone or being very difficult to use because of it's UI with tiny font and buttons.
"Kodi App is good but from some days back HD chanels are not playing in 1080 p quality and there is a problem of chanel freezes/buffering frequently despite of good internet speed. In jiotv addon setting if we enable extra HD channels , it is showing ""Playback failed "" error and no channel is being played. Please fix it and resolve this issue."
Too much background noise. I have this app installed on my desktop and my Fire Sticks and it works very well however when I load it onto my phone there's too much background noise so let me know when this app has been updated to get rid of the noise and I will reinstall it at that point
App works after you install and open it. Once you close it and reopen it opens with black screen and nothing can be done. When u uninstall and reinstall it repeats the same behaviour. Not user friendly at all unless fixed.
"Good app, but lately the jio tv plugin crashes a lot, doesn't let me play any channel, or the channel keeps lagging constantly, and there's nothing we can do except helplessly retrying it. Please provide a fix @developers"
"Stupid permacrash. Whenever I add subs file both dialogues close, then I play the movie for 5 seconds and it silently crashes. Seems to happen on any video and subs file when using smb shares. SMB folders are super slow to load as well. Iit cannot play many of my .avi files for some reason."
It throws me out the whole time !! Can't watch a movie done without it throwing me out atleast 3 times every 10 minutes and then it takes a lot of time to go back in or it says can't open file or the app crashes and asks me to close app....
I get this not a paid service. Kodi worked ok when first started using now basically the question I ask is what good is a free app that doesn't work. Constant freeze failure to play regardless of build or provider it just flat out doesn't work. It sometimes work for one vid then gets confused and shutsdown restarting everytime frustrating and annoying. Kodi is periodically broken
"I've been using kodi for years never had an issue until now. When I click on it, it does not want to open I don't understand why. I had Uninstalled it an reinstalled it, it works a few times and again same issue. WHY? I even pay for debrid to see all my movies can anyone help me here please. Thank you"
"I used to love this app. But now i am sick of it. Doesnt work, shuts down, closes unexpectly, freezes, & is nothing like the old Kodi. Sometimes newer is not always better. So I would really check the old codes that worked against the new codes that keep messing up."
"Barely works.. Tried watching Family guy, takes forever to load. Most of the time it doesnt load at all. Spent like 2,3 hours trying to make it work, reinstalling, trying different addons, but it just doesnt work :("
"Will search shows and movies but the links always freeze/load and it is annoying. Unsure of how many other people experience this but it is frustrating, free but frustrating most times."
"It's still a good version of kodi, but it's now barebones, and might as well just be a player. Because all but the base skins work in 19.1 matrix (high dpi galaxy Tab s4) meaning is ugly, and I can't install more skins ... but also ask the other add-ons won't install, either. Basically the software is formed. Don't update if you can help it."
"Everything has errors, things load extremely slow, same on the PC i tried it wasnt easy to use it either. I'll try it on firestick because of so many good reviews about it, maybe i didnt do something..."
"Update 18 made everything that worked before unusable, files in SMB folder cannot be played, UPnP/DLNA cannot see my PC Media Server, all of those worked before this update. After I restart my phone I can play files in SMB folder now but I still have problems adding UPnP device."
"I installed the Xanax build and took the app off. After a while, I put the app on but was startled by a really, really loud sound. I had headphones on and my volume was low but you could still hear it as if it was right in your ear."
I can't fathom why Google Play does not have the latest version of Kodi. That would be 18.6 which is available via downloader on Firestick. I went to Android TV specifically to have Google Play and now I find it a disappointment. Overall Android 10.0 is a nightmare and this Kodi version does not support my favorite builds because they are updated to run on Kodi 18.6
"18.2 seems to be more reliable than formers by faster ending frozen buggy addons but still heavily handling complicated menus oftenly frozen in many addons and somehow badly minded development. As a matter of fact no more compatible with far the best smartest reliable realtime tv coding well known Sopcast streaming! So, the smarter IPTV users already found more reliable compact faster less complicated apps handling these best used streamings mainly based on Sopcast that Kodi stupidly ignore.."
"I have no idea what happened, but the app is unresponsive if not unbearably slow on my Galaxy Tab 10.5 with the latest software update. Do not waste a minute (or hours for that matter) on this trash app."
2 stars cause it does what it supposed to do watch movies and episodes also easy to use. Only 2 stars some moive links are under the wrong title. for example I wanted to watch foot loose (1985) with Kevin bacon instead every link is the footloose 2011. Also the movie yesterday (2019) is listed with cover pics but instead ever link is every movie; ever with the word yesterday in its title. I'm sure at least half of movies listed has a hand full of links under the wrong movie
"Used it a few years ago and was magic, then install it recently on my android TV box ,and its not very good at all, download several of the channels but none of them really any good apart from crackle , what's happened to the good channels that were on there several years back ? I can't find them now ? Why ?"
"Kodi playback was flawless on all of my devices at 17.6. Forced play store upgrade to 18.1 has made video playback stutter, caused by problems in the HW acceleration on all android devices I've tried it on. WAF is in the negatives at the moment.  Devices include an x96 box, 2017 model Sony Android TV, M8S II. Issue is present on all.  Will be rolling back to 17.6 via APK until problem is resolved."
I tried to use it on a new tablet and I have always had an issue where I cannot select an item. It has gotten a lot worse. I scroll down and hope the menu item I want gets high lighted.
Jio tv not working properly
"Compared to Stremio not good. Interface when using smartphone is just unusable as navigating is hard, the app automatically goes to landscape, and then those weird sound effects."
"I used to love this app and then the update came for ver 18 now i can't get it to work. All my builds don't work properly on my Android. For example, I installed sreamline build and it wouldn't do anything when i pressed the buttons. Same thing with leia build, woman build, best 18 build are all not working. Ive tried 2 diff phones. Also, add-ons don't update. Please fix ASAP or tell me how i can fix it my dang self!! 😠😤"
"When I initially installed, it was the bees knees!! I told EVERYONE about it! Now, it almost ALWAYS DOES NOT WORK! Add the numerous updates are a pain in the whoo-haa. Just ridiculous. More, after they see what a success it is, they have decided to charge for VPNs, and all that jazz...smh nothing but a headache at this point"
"Not very happy with Kodi, I have reinstalled 18.9, 3 times, in the past 2 weeks, even though I turn off the auto update it keeps updating to 19.0 Matrix version which is not compatible with some apps I use. Why can't I keep 18.9?"
The interface is ridiculously complicated. And why using that clumsy keyboard and not the standard android one from the device? I cannot enter email addresses because there is no @ !!!!!
I really liked the previous version. I would run slideshow while listening to podcasts with another program. Now Kodi stops the podcast and Kodi does not prevent my tablet's screen from going to sleep. I will change my rating if the issues are addressed.
App won't work on my S21 5G. Turns out the app doesn't support 120Hz displays. I had to dig through the app's GitHub issues to find out. Most modern phones run at 90 or 120Hz. Not mentioning it anywhere on the App listing after multiple updates and complaints reflects and berating users who dare complain about it reflects poorly on the devs.
"man, I downloaded the last version of kodi on my last phone and it worked great, 18.0 is completely destroying it, cant find a single build that will even work on this version.... complete and utter garbage until they can fix their issues...."
"Latest update keeps dropping out! Very frustrating,especially when in the middle of a show. Version previous to last update worked fine."
Kodi 18 no longer works with .ifo files. This is my only use for Kodi. With this broken means it won’t play a DVD with menu from a memstick or a hard drive. Going back to kodi 17 cures this of course. Kodi is the ONLY Android app that does this killer function and allows Android pads to run DVDs properly.
Since update my sound in kodi randomly stops working. Only way to fix is to reinstall. Have done that multiple times and am no longer interested in using until fixed. I have tried different builds and no builds and there is no difference
My kodi box updated itself to Matrix overnight even with updates disabled in playstore. Now I cannot see my SMB shares anymore and it wants a username and password? Not everyone on here knows how to get in and edit .xml files. What have you done to this working app? In my opinion you have broken something that was not broken.....i wasted many hours of my day working out how to roll back to an earlier version. To the developer.....please FIX it asap!
Punch hole display phone are available in market from past 3 years. Still your phone does not support full screen on these phones. Are you still doing any research to figure out how to play full screen ? Please add support to play full screen.
Best multimedia player. But can you tell me how can i install this to a USB and automatic save all data in it? Installing Kodi on smart tv eats up all the space in your tv and causing it to slow and maybe collapse.
Keeps randomly skipping to the end of playback everytime. Its unpredictable and I have to reinput the link and fast forward where I left off every god dang time. Its infuriating!!!!
I downloaded kodi android installer and when i select stable releases...nothing happens.....have uninstalled reinstalled kodi..stillllll the same. Got a message one time to look in file explorer??? for an emulated something....could not find that either HELP...have heard great things about KODI but not to me
"on the new Matrix version, there are problems with selecting videos from the phone, it is almost impossible to select. So I'm giving you two stars"
WTH can't I use kodi. As soon as I open the app it goes black screen. Broken experience on a flagship phone... s22 ultra.. **Update s22 users can download the 64bit arm version labeled nexus or the beta version and it works for now
Not very touch screen friendly. Works fine with an remote control for example on a raspberry but the same gui in a tablet is almost a disaster.
"The display resolution is weird, unable to change the resolution at all, even I have hooked up to a 4k UHD tv, and the source file is a 4k UHD and my device had already set to 4k output , but my TV keep receiving only 720P signal, not even 1080P!"
"Kodi for Android is an obtuse program suffering from instability and the inability to even access the root Android folder. If you want to actually manage your media in a useful manner, go for VLC or Plex."
Always stops working after using few times
"Since Nexus, Kodi does not work on Samsung s20 cellphone"
"I've used this app for years, and lately it's difficult to read some of the articles due to the proofreading errors. I wonder if anyone (editors/journalists) takes the time to read their own articles. A single word or misplaced letter can change the entire meaning of an article. In addition, many articles are written with little or no content explaining what has happened. It's as if you need to take up space instead of giving accurate information. And the annoying, flashing ads in articles..."
"This has been one of my go-to mobile news apps for years, but that may be coming to an end with the most recent updates. I can handle the notification and video glitches as those issues will surely get resolved, but the ads....oh the ads. I understand that advertising is a necessary way to make money, but the ratio of ads to actual articles feels obnoxiously high. The new layout is terrible. It feels more like Fox Ads with a side of News."
"Latest version is a step backwards. Like many have said, news alerts go to the web instead of the app. Worst though is that I've had to turn off notifications as it's now using the Outlook email sound. This is confusing since my work email is on Outlook Mobile. I don't want to hear that notification sound after work and on weekends."
"ALL notifications now open in web browser instead of in app, please fix this, it's so annoying. I repeat, ALL notifications for Fox News now open in web browser instead of the app. It makes no difference which one, the weekday Fox News First newsletter or any individual news article, it's the same across the board. I see others have reported the same issue. It's not my phone, everything has been updated."
"Notifications are handled poorly. When you open one to read the article, all the other notifications vanish. Maybe you should call your friends at the WSJ to get this fixed. There you only delete the one that you read. Also, there doesn't seem to be a way to turn off the sound when a notification arrives, at least on the Android version."
Several times a week lately the app will not work properly. It gets stuck on Weather live even though I pick the actual live. It also tells me weekly to contact my provider even though it will work once I Uninstaller and reinstall. It's very annoying to have to keep doing that on my TV tablet and phone 3 xs a week. Please fix the bugs. I literally watch this app all day every day at work.
"Been using this app on my phone for years. However, with the last update, I have to be a speed reader to read any comment with ""read more"". Once expanded, I have a split second to read the rest of the comments before it collapses. Very irritating. I would like to have the articles from Fox Business comform to my settings, particularly dark mode. I read at night when I can't sleep; opening a FBN article while in dark mode is like getting poked in the eye."
"More times than i'd like, the app just endlessly buffers, won't open. I'm on wifi with 200mbs download speed and other news apps open instantly. Also, I have to agree with others. The screen endlessly jumps around while reading, the ads seem to be more important than the news, the ""read more"" option jumps back to the beginning, what's supposed to be a video portion of a story never opens up, and stories that switch to Fox Business News or other Fox site, do not follow my ""dark"" setting. Grrr."
"Love FOX, used to love this app. Difficult to read articles because of pop ups and adds. Worst listening stream I've ever experienced. Will not stream for more than 5 minutes at a time, if your lucky. The app has to usually be closed and restarted to play again. I have Samsung and an IPhone, both newer models. Have uninstalled and reinstalled on both devices. Same problems on both platforms. I QUIT!! ( WILL CHECK BACK IN FOR IMPROVEMENTS PERIODICALLY)"
"This app has really gone downhill recently. I've used this for years and I'm about to uninstall it. Article text jumping all over the place because of WAY too many ads, the *stupid* idea where it changes pages instead of scrolling down when you drag (this one really pisses me off), notifications that send you to a series of headlines instead of the article you expected, the ""read more"" button placed over ads that shows the last two paragraphs of the article (why even have it??). Come on Fox..."
"Needs work. Glad for comments but app is a bit wonky. It stops working periodically. User comments and replies are difficult to impossible to access. Notifications often don't render results. I get an indicator but when I select to see them I get a message that I have none. Then, I can only see one at a time. Nothing comes to my email and often get a sign-in prompt when I am signed in. I love the app, the network and the free-speech comments so I hang in there but..."
News videos randomly start playing in the background and you cannot get into the video because it doesn't show anywhere. I deleted the app until the problem is fixed because every time I try to read the new I have to go into the app info and force stop because of a video just randomly turning on. I'm tired of doing having to force stop. otherwise i would recommend it but until this particular problem is resolved I'm not wasting my time.
"Old app you could go to certain shows to watch clips, search for personalities, this one you either can't or it's so much harder. There used to be a drop down menu for this now its gone. I don't see how anybody can possibly like the newer version. Fox News, please don't feel the need to change something just because it feels like it's time. It was a 5 star app, past tense."
"The app works fine, but the notifications have recently became super clickbaity. If you're going to send a push notification with a breaking headline, tell me what happened. Don't send a clickbait message that makes me open the app to find out what happened. I have better news apps that don't use these cheap tactics, so I'm just going to block notifications from your app."
"I put the Fox News app on my Android TV and used it a few times weekly for a couple weeks. Now, it has been 5 months & I note more & more ads all the time. Today I wanted to watch 2 3-minute segments about COVID 19. I watched 2 30-second ads before each segment, and it tried to continue playing ads after each! So for 6 minutes of information, I was charged 3+ minutes of ads! Now I remember why I stopped using this! This is the worst it has ever been, but I'm betting not the worst it can get!"
"The live TV works for a totally unpredictable amount of time, then freezes. Usually in less than 15 minutes. I turn off notifications because they are frequent and very annoying. That seems to decrease the amount of time that the app works. So I uninstall it and download it again. That works for a while, as long as I allow the annoying notifications. In total, this app is far from being worth the trouble and continual frustration."
"The notifications started to become extremely click-baity. I want the breaking news notifications to tell me the news. Not entice me to open the app to find out what the news is. Also many of the articles wouldn't load properly after clicking the notification. I've had the app for a while, and just recently the notifications started to become extremely annoying and useless. No longer need it. Uninstalled"
"I am having the same exact experience that many others are having. Six months ago, the app worked perfectly. Now, I am completely unable to watch live TV on my phone, because all I get is the endless circles (though I can watch on my tablet, which makes no sense). I can watch video clips on both devices, as long as I don't mind if the video and audio do not match up. In the last few months, I have also lost the ability to auto-rotate; and, I agree that the ""click bait"" nonsense needs to go."
"I've had to uninstall and reinstall this app so many times I've lost count. On numerous occasions, loading the streaming video just stops working and the red circle just jeeps spinning. On other occasions, I'm being told I don't have authorization to access the content. It's really disappointing. I have to screenshot my saved list of articles, uninstall, and reinstall. Incredibly frustrating."
"This app works, then it doesn't. Then it works again, then broke again. Latest update broke pictures in the app. Previously, if you wanted to view a picture full screen, you could click it for more detail. Now if you click a picture, it is smaller than the embedded photo. Videos work intermittently, seems better reliable without a fast WiFi (using the cellular radio instead). If I'm on wifi it never finishes buffering. (Dreaded spinning circle) Tested on Google Pixel 3A and Pixel 4."
"Good app when it works, HORRIBLE when it doesn't. The app can work fine for days or weeks and then it kicks you out. Sometime to give you the opportunity to log back in to your television account but sometimes it just says that you don't have the authorization and doesn't give you the opportunity to log in. I can delete and re install the app and it does the same thing. Very frustrating"
This app fails to load the audio version of news updates constantly. It attempts to open the news updates and then just closes them repeatedly. Also it crashes in the middle of playing a news update which is infuriating! I would give it five stars if you could fix this annoying problem. Please fix it. Now the latest hourly news headlines haven't updated in several days. Please fix it.0
"App has problem and cannot find mobile app dev to report it to. The Fox News mobile app should have a feedback-support button. There are 3 views of an active video. One is the postage stamp or icon sized video. The vid works perfectly i n that view. Both the 2nd and 3rd (the top third of screen in portrait mode, and full screen in landscape), are always stuck showing a cloudy film and the pause marks, the forward and reverse 10 sec symbols. I have a Pixel 3aXL with Android 10. YouTube is fine."
When I go to Fox News in my browser I get a pop up to use the app on every single page. So I finally gave in and installed the app but it doesn't work right. Links don't always work and content is often missing. Very frustrating!
"I am not happy with your latest update. Everything is working fine until this latest update. Now, when the Fox News app opens, it scrolls a bit then crashes! This only happens with this app! Please revert to the earlier version ASAP so this app can work properly again! Thank you."
"After many years of making Fox News a central part of my morning ritual, I can no longer bear the onslaught of ads. The related browser experience is abysmal and the final straw on the app for me is the autoplay ads with audio that will not turn off. I'm incredibly bummed, but just can't continue to support the invasion."
"I love fox news. I don't ALWAYS agree with everything, but for the most part I do. Now for my gripe. Every time that I try to give a thumbs up to someone's response or even post my own response, I get an error message to refresh and try again. I've tried erasing the app and reinstalling, but nothing works. It's very frustrating to the point where I'm about to uninstall for good. I hope others aren't having to struggle with this also."
The app won't show you the picture leading the story INSIDE the story. It's been an annoyance but I'm just getting done with the app. The text box for comments isn't even clever enough to auto capitalize. 😒
"This used to be my go-to app for news, but I am changing that due to the advertisement takeover. The fact that the recent updates to the app now allow ads to play audio just by their mere appearance somewhere on the page that I am ""quietly reading"" is completely unacceptable. Sadly, not even silencing my phone's audio stops the ad's audio from playing. I would love to update this review following an effective change to the aforementioned issue."
I have 3 problems with this app and each cost it a star. 1: The stupid noisy commercial that just starts blasting stupid music as I scroll through the news. 2: The stupid way that the articles mix themselves up as I scroll so that I see the same ones multiple ti.es by the time I reach the bottom of the feed. 3: The way it bugs my phone down if I leave the app open while switching another app. Fox is the only app that does that to my phone.
"I had previously given this app a 4 star rating and I still enjoy the news it offers. But lately while I'm on the app it starts plying some stupid tune that I assume is a notification of some kind. I don't want it and I can't find how to turn it off. If it continues I have a sure fire way to turn off its called ""uninstall"". I'm open to suggestions."
"It appears that there is no editor involved with this app, as I find spelling and gramnar errors every day. And now some reporters are giving-in to the ""Woke"" agenda, for instance, calling a transgender (non-surgical), biological male, accused child molester, ""she."" Apparently facts don't matter anymore. I feel as though high school students are running the show here. Much of the so-called news is either tabloid or ""he said/she said."" Also the app is resource hungry, always loading something."
Stop the Music! Every time I read a story music starts playing that I don't want. Sometimes it even continues playing after I close the app.
The ads will autoplay with sound as soon as you scroll to their place. Not a welcome experience if you are only trying to read the articles.
"App not worth the trouble! I can't understand why Fox does not have a app for live TV like News Max and others! More and More folks are cutting cords and now we can't watch Fox. Seems to me that most would gladly pay for a A live Fox app just like we do for Netflix ,HBO, and many more!"
the annoying play skip layer wont go away with watching videos even after tapping the screen. Needs a fix ASAP. For being the biggest news network this is kind of sad Dev work.
I've been very annoyed lately that I am constantly pushed notifications for articles to which I have no interest. PLEASE add an option to stop seeing notifications for specific stories or topics!
I thought I was the only who was having the issues with the app not opening correctly but apparently that isn't the case. My notifications no longer direct me to the app. They take me to a web page that then asks me to open the story in the app. It's obnoxious enough that I'm turning off notifications and likely going to delete the app.
"The app has glitches in the ""Watch"" section. I used to be able to watch live ""Fox News Go & Fox Business."" I could also watch the previous days shows like Tucker, Hannity, Gutfeld, Laura Ingram, etc. Those shows no longer play. I can still watch short clips and latest news clips. Live content such as ""Fox Weather & Fox Radio"" do still work correctly. I have deleted & reinstalled the app & cleared the data & cache multiple times. Happens on wifi or cell data. Please help."
"I used to love the app until it decided to not open thru notifications. Now every time I tap on a notification the article opens up in my web browser, which then asks me if I want to open the article in the app and when you select open it brings you to the play store and and tells me it's already installed on my device. I have uninstalled/reinstalled, cleared data, cache, cookies, etc but still to no avail.... please by all means fix this issue and I'll change my rating"
This has been my go to app to listen to Tucker and other shows at work. Never needed to record them and fast forward the commercials. Now whats the point. Adding on ads now and can not skip them. Why pay for this if i can just record the shows and even watch some of them like the five on my tv app.
I cannot get rid of the pause control in the middle of the screen and the a 10-second advances and rewinds on either side
"Stops working to stream live TV, yet Fox Business app still works. Clearing cache, force stop does nothing only clearing data or removing & reinstalling helps. The app may be too space consuming."
The app is awesome but Live TV stopped playing on my phone for over a month now. That's why 2 stars will change to 5 stars when it's fixed
"To many ads clutter the reading experience. The double lettering allows for hazy focus when you're trying to read. The plain letters of a word allows more focus, thus you read more! It is similar to your eyes being crossed which mine are not. Please go back to plain lettering like in this review. Thx!"
"What the hell happened to FOX!? Did somebody buy them out and then gut them? If l want to see back to back to back commercials I'll play one of those Chinese ""money games"". You used to be worthwhile, now I'm back to AON."
I have a question Why can't we subscribe to Fox news as a stand alone app like foxnation or a lot of other apps we can subscribe to. I know there is a reason but I don't know why myself. Can you explain so ppl will know As far as I am concerned foxnews channel is the Best news channel on TV today . Ppl sure wish they could subscribe to it without subscribing to a app with 50 to 60 channels just to get Foxnews and a couple other news channels not worth watching but ...... Thank you..
"Has been my favorite news app. Now ads have become a real issue. They have even inbedded the ads inside the news story. The ads start up as you read the article, which is super annoying. If this continues I might be forced to uninstall the app."
"Poor connections. On the area, called, Exclusive Clips, a few stories are shown. Then below, it says, Tap to Expand. Problem is, it rarely expands. I don't care if I am sitting 5', from the WiFi/modem, or in a T-Mobile facility with 5 bars showing. I still can't see the rest of the news in this area. What's Wrong??? I reinstalled it, Fox News, still no better. Galaxy 10+"
"Good app when it's working... 50/50 chance whether or not the videos under the ""Watch"" tab will work or not... Also if you switch out of the App even for seconds, the video resets back to the start... Galaxy 22 ultra... 11/29 was hoping the update would fix the video problem, but still only getting the red circle"
"Never seen more commercials. Layer upon layer and can't close them. You post a headline and click on it and get attacked by an ad bomb. Then I have to go searching for the headline just to find it somehow and get attacked by more ads! I like fox, but this is an uninstall for me! Quit being so damn greedy....you lost me."
"Not liking one of the recent updates! When I click a notification, it now opens in my web browser instead of the app. Once opened on the web, I'm asked if I want to view the article from the app. YES... that's why I installed the app! Please fix this."
"I like Fox News, but I'm really disliking this ap. First, the news briefs that pop up on my screen are, usually, nothing more than teasers, with no real information included. They are typical media fodder, enticing me to open the ap. When I do click on the ""bait"" to open the ap, it instead opens the Fox News web page and then prompts me to open in the ap, which takes me to Google Play (this page you are on) where I can then, open the ap. The other (tempting) option at this point is UNINSTALL!"
"I , too, have had the original FOX News app for years. This new app seems like a repeat of everything. Running an article a second time with a tag that it is an ""updated"" would seem less invasive than having double the articles to open."
"Exclusive Clips show more always has loading error, try again. Tried all suggestions to fix. Just started about a week ago. Everything else seems fine. Maybe broke in last update? Same result on two android devices. Same result on wifi and mobile network."
I have used this app for years and love commenting after I read articles. Since it updated the comment section is gone? What am I missing? UPDATE: EVERY COMMENT SECTION IS GONE FOR EVERY ARTICLE. I CLICKED ON ALL OF THEM.
"Been using this app for years, the latest update ruined the app. I get ads between nearly every article and this morning I got a super annoying ad that pops up from the bottom of the screen and cannot be dismissed."
"Dark mode is no longer dark mode? Where did the blue color go for dark mode? Headline background area for news stories is white even with dark mode on, but not long ago, dark mode made those backgrounds dark blue. Clicked dark mode setting and it changed the screen brightness inside the app darker? No take the white backgrounds back out please"
Music just starts playing at random times while using the app. Lasts about 20 seconds then stops only to start again atcrandom intervals. Took weeks to figure out how to get live video again after update.
When I'm watching live TV on your app it constantly cuts out every time they go to commercial breaks very frustrating
"I don't like the recent updated version. Every time I get a notification, try to open it. It takes me to Chrome. It asks you if you want to open the app. Why? The notification used to take me directly to the app and NOT to Chrome."
"Every news notification I get sends me to the web version. Once I get to the web version, it asks me if I want to open in the app. Yes!!! It should automatically open in the app. That's how I got the notification in the first place"
Was working fine. But now it takes you to a article on the web instead of app and when I click view in app it brings me to play store. If I wanted to view it in browser then I wouldn't have the app. Please fix this very annoying issue
Start. Stop. Restart videos. ADS ADS ADS ADS. Very frustrating experience. Very unhappy.
Slow to load main page and videos are even worse I could bring up Fox news in web browser way faster. Why would I use this app?
"Crashes everything launched in past few days, on samsung tablet. Clear cache not helping. Last security update was Feb 2023"
"Wow, this latest update of the app really messed up the face of the app. I clicked on my option to have a dark theme, and it comes up white. That's too bright when looking at stories in the evening. It actually looks like the app is currently still under construction."
Obnoxious constant popups that would freeze and make unable to close forced me to finally install app... i was fine witbout it
Very disappointed in this new version. The ads are super annoying and in the way. Go back to the older version and get rid of all the click bate ads.
Alerts used to open in the app which was great. For the past month or so they open in a browser instead. I absolutely hate this and want to delete the app. Please fix
The ads are a pain but the inserted photos and media posts from other stories not even related to what you are reading about makes me believe that there is no quality control. The writer consistently repeats themselves and the grammar and spelling is sometimes as though a middle school student wrote the article.
Constantly have to re sign in to tv provider when this happens you have to go in and clear cache and data witch works but annoying
"Makes a bad noise when sending me news. If blocking does not help, i will delete the app."
"The app is good. But... In the last couple of updates, when clicking on a notification the browser and app opens. Very annoying."
"Latest update - when opening any story, app locks up then restarts. Seems like it's related to ads loading/changing. Too many ads in app anyway... I'll find something different"
"It took more than 10 attempts to download a WORKING app! Then, the same week, while trying to read and comment on a story, I was interupted 3x to 'upgrade'! Now, I cannot find the comments section I was commenting in! I expected much better from Fox!!! ( Short time later!) Problem continues to get worse! Prompted again, to upgrade! Then had to resign in. App immediately came to comments I mentioned above, along with this opportunity to 'edit my comment's!"
"I like their news coverage, but hate getting push notifications after deselecting them."
I HATE the auto play videos!!!! I don't ever want them.
Why does it have to notify me all day? I can't turn off the notification sound!
"There are two main problems. The most annoying is that the screen controls are always on. Pause button, etc. always shows and no way to turn it off. The second is that the comment options are limited. Can't edit or see responses like on the website. I am using a Samsung Galaxy 10+ and Android 12 UI 4.1."
All videos are going to web browser!! They will not load in the app at all! What's the use of having the app if I end up on the web anyway?! Waste of space on my phone memory. 😵😡☠️
I like Fox News but it appears that journalistic quality of articles written on this app is extremely poor. They've also redesigned the app to really highlight the clickbait ads. It's fairly annoying..
"Terrible redesign. If you scroll the top row left.....and then scroll down on the page and come back to the top row, it went back to the 1st headline, now where you left off."
"Fedup with the irrelavant notifications on everything, I just turned off all notifications. Ads are excessive."
"It's a great news app, i only have one true issue. I completely understand that advertising is a necessary component to programming but when I listen to the radio news cast the app will play the same advertisement 2-5 times back to back. It is truly maddening. 11/21/2022 Better for you food commercial 6x back to back."
"This app is a mess. Dare try to go to comment section without the app going bonkers. Plus, Fox news is.....compromised at best."
"Signed in, allowed to up/down vote conversations, but not allowed to post comment or response. No updates to play store... So much for America is engaging..."
Fox News Radio plays same commercials over and over again. Very old need to vary up commercials. Ridiculous!
Way too ad heavy. For a 30 second video expect to watch a 30 second ad every time.
I've been using this app for years and have NEVER been able to switch to the Twitter app to see Tweets that are embedded in news stories.
"Want to know how to make me never buy a product ? Beat me over the head with the same ad over and over and over back to back to back, always the same ads three or four times in a row, yesterday was an Amazon commercial that repeated seven times in a row. Your production team seems to be a bunch of drunk monkeys pushing buttons. Random bits of a story out of nowhere with zero context then goes to a commercial break comes back in the middle of a completely different story never finishing the one"
Constant ads...zero control. Dump this app
Just wondering if Fox news Tech support people are working on fixing the app. I use the android version and it's not working properly. I hit the Watch TV button and it works from the beginning. Once the channel goes to commercial it shuts down the app. When I bring it back up there is no sound. Even when the news channel returns from commercials it conts to have no sound. I need to get out of the app and go back in to get the sound back. Is ANYONE fixing this issue?
I like FOX news but this app is terrible. it's very annoying trying to read an article and you have to click through 25 Pages just to read the article. one paragraph next one paragraph next. this is very frustrating and annoying. I recommend you improve the overall navigation of the app and do away with how you currently present external material. no one likes clicking through 25 or 30 pages and a stupid amount of advertising to read 11 lines of text. Fix it please
"I love the stories and updates. But the app itself sucks. You tap on a story with pictures and 90 % of the time, they never load. Today, I'm trying to read the story about UAW going on strike. The story tells about what GM is offering them. It's on some enlarged chart. It's so big, you can only read the first 3 words of each sentence. You can't rotate the phone because the app will not rotate. You can't click on the chart or enlarge it. The story on the app is useless."
I like fox news and all of the content. Only problem is things like links do not work in the app but do work in a browser. Also the pages that slide shows do not work. Examples are what they look like now and best and worst. Typical of CA technology apps.
"After watching a video, then navigating out, the audio rudely continues to play in the background, with no way to control it. At least the prior version had audio controls, albeit hidden in the pull-down, now it's gone. Only way to cancel the audio is to shutdown the app. Boo-Hiss !..."
"I had this app for about a year and always enjoyed it. I only had trouble a few times until recently, it woulnd not let me scrool down a page without it jumping to the top of the story. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it was much worse after that. I could not get anyting to load. The layout is nice but they need to fix the gliches."
"I love fox news content & I keep struggling through your app, but it's frustrating how every ad loads fine, but story pics, videos, & links, hardly work... very disapointing. 😒 And please do not ask me (like you have to other responses to reviews here) to open a ticket with examples. From reading other reviews, obviously theses are common issues that we are all experiencing. I'm sure you can recreate these issues yourself."
To many ads and they play at inappropriate times and they cut out portions of recorded video ( almost as if it's censoring the video). Ads play during the middle of the show then I have to sit through the commercial break I think the app needs to be reworked but other than that its great it puts out the news that no one else will
"For viewing, it's fine. For even very basic editing, it's endlessly janky and ultimately unusable. As an example: when placing text, the bounds of the text box have handles, BUT will always auto-resize to an unpredictable width when clicking away. And once you click away, the text is no longer editable. So imagine typing 500 words into a field, clicking away from the field, and it spontaneously resizes to now only occupy the left side of the page. And you can't fix it, you have to start over."
"Using this app (free version) as a PDF document reader - pages only scroll left to right, it used to be up/down scrolling where you can see a portion of the adjacent page. And without having an indicator showing that I'm looking at page 1 of 4 (or however many), I am frequently missing out on pertinent information for work that is not on page 1 of the PDF. Bring back up/down scrolling, or at the very least put of a display of ""page 1/4"" for example. Stop needlessly changing things w/o reason!"
"I've used this app for so many years and I've loved it. It was perfect for getting signatures and filling out forms electronically in real time, with my customers. Then it updated. Just read all the other reviews. Very clunky now. The tried to simply everything that it's become more of a pain to get initials, signatures, and fill out forms. I really wish they would would remove the stupid edit icon and bring back the full screen with the task menu options. Plus the scrolling is now clunky. There really was no reason to change all of this. Don't get me wrong. It's still a great pdf editor and i would have kept my review at 5 stars. but the new changes are very annoying."
"Huge step backwards in the latest version. Search used to produce a visual list of all of the places where the word or words appeared. You could scroll through them, see which ones were relevant, and then tap the one you wanted to go to that page. This is gone. Makes no sense and makes Acrobat much less useful. There seems to be a bug with the arrow to go back to the list of documents. About two-thirds of the time, it simply exits Acrobat. You have to restart acrobat, which sometimes opens back in the document, and then the arrow works, and sometimes opens in the list of documents. The inconsistent behavior is frustrating and the need to go through multiple clicks for no reason is time-wasting and evidence of poor programming and poor quality control. There are other problems with features that were apparently removed, but those two are the obvious main points. Previously, I would have given Acrobat four and a half stars or better. Sadly, I have to reduce that to two stars. I use the search feature constantly, so the reduced capability is a killer for me. Oh, and $25 a month just to rotate pages? That's ridiculous."
"The new update no longer allows you to send multiple files at the same time. It consistently freezes the app when you try to sign the form. You have to shut the computer multiple times to get it to sign properly. I would recommend trying it yourself. I am only getting 2 options when selecting the ""three dots"" (also known as option selection) I'm seeing remove from recent and delete. No option to share."
This latest upgrade screwed up all the good things I liked about the app. I use large PDF files. Bookmarks were once easy to set up and use; now they require navigating with tapping on the screen several times just to set them up or to find them. Entirely too confusing and unnecessary. Even getting to the file browsing system section is now more difficult than it should be. One misstep and the screen enlarges and you got to figure out how to get back. I use it to read music lyrics on stage and can't be spending a lot of time navigating a crappy app between songs. It seems Adobe could not leave well enough alone.
"The PDF standard was supposed to standardize documents to that they are highly consistent across many platforms, however the complete opposite seems to be true. Compared to just about every other text editing program, it is by far the most difficult to collaborate when working with people who have to rely on other standards. Even the #1 feature of getting things to print out consistently is something that rarely happens across different systems. Text-to-Speech sometimes works yet copying and pasting the very same text somehow does not work without paying for their premium conversion service."
"I use this app for my classes just to go over and save information. Has worked great and good for when I need to fill out work documents. I love i can have all my work and school things in one place and also open them across my devices. I use it on my phone, tablet, and laptop. So the fact that it has been crashing constantly on both my phone and tablet the past week is very aggravating. The app won't stay open more than a couple seconds. I've re-downloadded and tried multiple times."
"I use this daily for work. I need it so I can create invoices, have customers sign them, and then send them off as bills. However, the text boxes jump all over the screen if I do anything other than type, once I am done editing a text box, it automatically resizes and changes fonts, worst of all, the words at the end of the line consistently get cut short if a text box is more than a few lines long, which has caused many complaints by customers. Also there is no form of organization in files"
Not ideal for multi-device systems and students. I still can't manage to get any of my comments or notes to sync using the cloud. I've tried everything. It's okay enough as a reader - it does refuse to open anything I just downloaded - but it still leaves much to be desired as an annotation tool. I've completely lost hundreds of pages of notes before & when notes do stick around they're trapped on a single device...
"I think this app does its job. I have had to uninstall it regularly to restore speed on opening large files, and lately that doesn't help. I have a manual that is 136 MB and 3120 pages. It takes 12 seconds to open and 8 seconds for the contents to show. Then added time up to 12 seconds to display new pages. I can open it in Google drive, it takes 10 seconds to scroll to the bottom, then instantly displays any page in the book. Unfortunately it doesn't support bookmarks. Years of this behavior."
I've purchased this app many timesover the years and pay one price and own it till the next version came out. During the year you would receive updates which were fixes to the bugs that were in the program (NO CHARGE) I first purchased adobe was in 1993 and every year or so. Now it's a constant money grabber every month if not more often. And it broke down in many parts. I don't know about anyone else but I can't afford this but can't do without it. Somebody make a pdf app for one price for all.
"Not crazy about this app. Its a PIA to scroll from top to bottom and vice versa . Also loves to jump around while using. Like from page 1 to page 335 all sudden. Also jumps around when zooming in and out of pages and documents, and when it jumps around you loose your page and spot. This is really annoying when your reading a large 100 + page manual or document"
"Latest version causes an irritating pop-up. After exiting the app, if I do not manually close it, when my phone rings, it comes up with a pop up regarding in-app purchases. I have to swipe the pop up off the screen before I can answer the phone call, and it has caused me to miss calls. If this is not resolved soon I am going to uninstall the app, and transfer any PDF files that I need to view to my desktop."
The app worked great until the last galaxy system update. Currently I cannot locate the app but it starts when I plug it into the car. The navigation works fine I can make and receive calls. I can receive text but cannot send text. It allows me speak the text but When it asked me to send or change it says the Internet connection is unstable. It also will not shut down automatically when I remove the phone from the car and the car is turned off.
"It's just annoying that phones now a days being the most used for things like this don't have this kind of thing already installed and for free or less then $20 a month when you don't really use it much. I would have done the free trail but I didn't want to deal with having to make sure within a mouth to cancel before the ""terms and conditions"" automaticallytake it out."
"You don't have tabs or multiple windows on the Chromebook app. Everytime I try to open a new document, it closes out of the article and opens the other one instead of opening a new tab or window. Makes it a bit hard to cross-reference and do my grad research. I'm also not fond of the presentation. The document is always fit-to-screen and I'm unable to zoom out to make it easier to read. Would love to have these issues resolved to continue enjoying the service rendered. Thanks!"
"After (2 weeks) the review I left below, I had issues with downloads on attachments I've downloaded for the past five years. I'm not happy at all what Adobe has done. Says there's an error and I would have to store in internal storage before the download, what?!*^%! That's not been the case before. Uninstalling until corrected. 10.5.18 Acrobat allows me to download the most emails attachments and it opens pretty quickly. This I like bc my devices don't stall or freeze up. Thanks also for the infrequent updates that other apps do and at times fail the basic functions..... not so with Acrobat.😊😊😊"
"Something went wonky. It used to be relatively quick and easy to simply use the comment feature to fill out .pdf forms, add a pre-saved signature, and send it off. Now, for some damned reason. I can't move text into place without it trying to jump halfway across the screen or switch to resizing the text box. Close to fury with this garbage. Looking for another editor now."
"It allows you to VIEW the file. I received a 400 page document from work which was manually scanned..... upside down. There is a simple rotate button within the pc version at the top toolbar. This option is not available on the Android app unless you subscribe. The name of this app in the Play Store is, ""Adobe Acrobat Reader: Edit PDF."" It was a free download. BUT it appears that you can only EDIT if you subscribe. I learned this only after granting access to my Drive. I find this misleading."
"You would think the originator of the PDF format would know how people actually want to use the program. Guess not. Being able to view 2 non sequential pages in a document, searching, and highlighting should be simple. It's really easy with a print out. But not in Adobe. Then they hide other usefull things behind very expensive paywalls that should quite literally be 1/2 what they actually cost."
"This app used to have a great search feature that would show you the paragraphs a word was in and the page numbers so you could rapidly find things. That has been patched out and this app is now completely useless for my purposes. It just cycles between instances of words, it doesn't even tell you how many instances there are anymore. Trash."
"This app was outstanding until the latest update. Now the navigation bar is always showing. This is especially annoying in landscape mode. Not only this, but whenever you are scrolling up, the top panel shows up every time. Please switch back to the old PDF navigation UI. The new one is not good."
"When you use the ""sign and fill"" feature in the free version (because who needs yet another subscription service just to fill out a PDF), the program seemed hell bent on making sure that what appeared on the screen during a save wasn't actually what saved. Any text box that was as long as my name or a credit card number was chopped off at the end. Kind of unacceptable for a multi billion dollar company that saves passwords in plain text. At least give us a free PDF editor that works properly."
"This is a really good app for reading PDFs. My rating is based on what it claims to do vs what it actually does. In the Play Store it makes the claim to edit and combine PDF files. However that requires an upgrade, andnot even to a simple purchase plan but to a subscription service. $10 a month is fine for businesses that are going to use Acrobat all the time -- and I own the high end Acrobat for my desktop computer -- but I just want to combine a few files on my tablet."
Do you guys even try your programs before putting them out to the public? I'm trying to sign a PDF and it makes marks anywhere fingers touch the screen.... I try to zoom in so I can draw my signature but it zooms straight in without the ability to pan over to where I need to sign. since there is no ability to pan it just automatically starts drawing. It doesn't matter if it's a desktop program or a phone app the last thing considered is user experience!!!!!!
"OK as a reader but has many issues. Very resource hungry, unstable, hard to do many simple stuff. Hard to complicate docs. Tried it for months, crash 3 times in a row trying to fill a very simple 1 page sign in sheet so I'm un-installing it and trying anything else (unlikely it can be worst). Could not find a way to save back into the device, took to long loading & rendering some files. Crashes right after filing out info losing all data. Plus many other issues. Very disappointed."
"Great but inconsistent This app is great. It has cloud integration so I can view all my files across different platforms without having to switch apps. However navigation through this app is a little strange. Sometimes when I'm using Dropbox and look at a pdf when I press back it will go back multiple directories. Because this only happens sometimes, the app is unpredictable."
Works but there's absolutely no reason to force you to log into the app with a 3rd party (Google etc.) account. To say it's to help improve the app is disingenuous at best. I should be able to open a document without having my information being collected. Acrobat Reader used to work that way without problem.
"Everything was fine until the past update. Now it won't open at all. It just sits on the opening red page that says ""Adobe Acrobat for Samsung"" and NEVER opens my pdfs. I've reloaded multiple times and it doesn't work on any file. Super frustrating considering the number of pdfs I deal with for work! It used to be so easy to use and print from!"
"It's a shame to have to need something like this so I can print pdf files. This says it's for all files, but many downloads from websites are not able to be opened with this app. All I wanted to do is be able to print to a wireless printer. I can't decrease font size to print less pages. I tried edit, but apparently the extras all cost money. It's 2022 and reading,editing and printing pdf's should be as standard as automatic door locks on a car. I'll be looking for something else."
"Changed my mind. So annoying: don't wish to subscribe. It's extortive/frustrating. I can't do anything with Gov forms/etc sans-printer/scanner. Too proprietary...Adobe, you've already got my partner over a barrel with Lightroom, etc for Photography. Give all a break, especially customers who have/do support - NSFs & service/data interruption is NOT OK. Amazon looks b4 'autograb'! &Grace?! PLEASE! Ruthlessly cutthroat not salespitch. MS Biz plan=MS Family Sav $!?!Great products tho!"
I wish I didn't update to this latest version! I do most reading on 'Night mode' and the previous version was excellent. All white parts were turned to black. This latest version leaves random white parts on some page sections. When I zoom out/in the white sections move about. I wish I retained the previous version.
"Like another reviewer, I'm looking for an alternative PDF reader, because I am tired of the liquid mode pop-up that can't be turned off. If Adobe will give us the *option* of turning it off and deciding when we want to use liquid mode - if at all - then I might come back to using this app."
"Unable to open more than one pdf on my Chromebook. I pay for Adobe DC, and I know I could use the Adobe browser. I just don't like to. I long debated between purchasing a Chromebook vs Windows laptop. In hindsight I should have gone with the Windows based."
This app makes all the things like finding a pdf and deleting old PDFs so cumbersome. Like I'd like to check a PDF before deleting so if I open it I can't delete it. Then I need to search the same pdf long press then delete. Some other things also like everytime I open the PDF it asks to open in its liquid flow view which I don't like at all. There's no option to permanently disable it as well.
Need to rotate a page? Pay $70 per year or $10 per month! I only downloaded this app so I could rotate a PDF but sadly couldn't even do that without signing up for a subscription. What ever happened to buying an application outright? Why does it have to be a subscription?
"The app does not correctly display the contents of some pdfs. Even on a powerful smartphone, it takes tens of seconds to open more complicated documents."
"Can't select all files at once to combine into so gle pdf. Had to select 60 pages one by one and add them to made a document. Something that simple apps can do, but this."
"Although this is THE benchmark, it sucks for reading books because you lose your page when you shuts off the screen, especially in the liquid mode."
"Clunky, file browser doesn't work at all, annoying as hell with its barrage of popups about useless features... But it does read pdfs - a necessary evil."
Too expensive. Price keeps going up. Frequent issues with desktop app staying signed in. Value just not there at $19+/month
Please stop changing the app layout all the time. We dont need anything more you already offer. Everytime you make a change we spend too much time to get used to it.!!
Does not need AI. Does not need to push a subscription. Just go for a freeware equivalent instead. There are better apps than this one for the same purpose.
"Would have probably been an okay app, if I didn't have to subscribe just to use the edit feature, which is why I downloaded it in the first place."
"With so many other free PDF readers available, Adobe is way too pushy with their ads and nagging to get you into premium. Then the reader still can't open all PDF's! Try opening one received from SARS and it tells you you need Acrobat Reader DC! Pathetic!"
"The ability to create a new signature does not populate when pressing the fill an sign, then signature symbol. Can't do my job and I'm paying for this access."
"Adobe Acrobat Reader: Edit PDF, and that ""Edit PDF"" is the only reason that I installed this app. And that one feature I needed the most is what I need to pay for to use."
"No file history, frequently closes the files I'm working on when the app is put into the background. Typical Adobe."
Liquid mode is good for reading in mobile. but I faced issues while sharing pdf as when I click 'send a copy' and share on whatsapp then nothing happens
When i try to open a file it's almost black. I cant even read it. I updated the app but nothing changed.
I been having issues printing coupons before everything was fine with printing coupons now I am not able is the app free because all its ask is upgrade and there is a price please explain
When viewing pdf files in hindi its shows question mark and nothing else. Everything is good except for hindi pdf files. Re: Still the issue of reading hindi pdf files is not resolved.
"Continually fails to save. I'll leave the document, says it saves and later when I leave the program and come back it says failed to save, and I lose everything. This happened twice in a row, five hours of wasted time. Unacceptable for a program like this to not have auto save as an option."
"Would be ok if it didn't keep forcing me to use a feature called ""Liquid"" which seems to do nothing useful and which I can't turn off."
"Not sure why, but when reading the G & M newspaper, I frequently have to exit and reopen the file to get rid of the current page having turned all white. Tried clearing cache and reinstall but problem persists. Very annoying"
"Last update make me cannot open large size file (over 450MB) Ps. Files not damaged, it can open in other application or on PC"
"Can not open pdf on NAS, says nothing useful except ""cannot read.....check connection or make file name shorter"" and then ""a system error occurred"" :/ Worked fine on my galaxy s9+ but seems it cant handle new Android version on my s22 Ultra. Have to try some other app"
I shouldn't have had hopes for this app after seeing the reviews. Even simple exporting from pdf to word gets everything jumbled up.
Was giving it a 5 star review but now it won't open anything it all. Just opening the app itself makes it crash like over half the time.
"Fails to render some PDFs correctly. I've got some large technical reference documents that I have been referring to for the past decade. I have read them on eReaders from Sony, Amazon and Kobo. I have read them on iOS devices, Windows, Linux, BSD and macOS using a variety of closed-source and open-source PDF readers, including Adobe Acrobat. Acrobat Reader for Android is the only application that fails to render these documents correctly, often displaying blank areas. Other readers work better."
After 3hrs trying to get a free trial which was never on the option page it opens I got a google card so I could use the trial and again only mothly pay options so I went for premium for trial.. Couldn't get the app to open to anything that resembled a working sheet options pave. Kept getting popups requiring me to subscribe. Checked my Google account and it stated I was on a premium plan. So after a day of trying to get in the app I loaded I added my computer. BAHAHAH is all I can say there..
There is no liquid mode for more than 200 page book. Dumping adobe wouldn't be an option if you improve this feature
Very frustrating. App crashes everytime I try to add a signature.
"Hi, nobody likes liquid mode. Stop recommending liquid mode. Nobody even asked for liquid mode. Not a day goes by where liquid mode does anything good for anybody. Every time I open the app I don't want to see liquid mode keep flashing. We all can agree that liquid mode cannot possibly comprehend uniquely formatted documents with tables and charts, so just stop trying. No more liquid mode. Thanks."
Mediocre at best. Clearly they don't pay any attention to what a user would want from the app. Barely worth the monthly cost.
"For all the years that subscriptions did not exist, adobe did just fine. Subscriptions for a product like this are no better than ads popping up in every app and mobile game. This app is impossible to make use of because of it."
"I didn't want to use this anymore because it seemed to require you to log in to use it. To get around the login screen, press on the upper right corner of the login screen. An alternative PDF reader is Office (Microsoft 365)."
Not working properly can't highlight can't use any feature very frustrating.texts are not visible for long
Liquid mode not available for files over 200 pages. It is with free WPS.
"What I'm looking for: a simple, better pdf viewer to view pdfs locally. The first thing this app asks for: a login. Bye."
"I don't like the newest update (18.3), its buggy, especially when u scroll down, the toolbar thing keeps popping up unnecessarily, distracting and blocking my view and it takes up space unlike before. Its also much more difficult to search now, where it takes longer than before and you have to go through the words one by one, unlike before where its finds the pages to search for the word u are looking for (this was way better). And it has difficulty managing larger sized files, where it also takes more than a couple of minutes to load the file. The older version was better. I'm disappointed in what it has become. :("
"2 big problems with reflow feature: 1)it doesn't have dark version(which it vital for all amoled displays); it doesn't remember the last place you were in a file, so you are forced to manually find that place every time you want to read a book, for example. The feature itself is amazing and, unlike in other apps, in Adobe it actually works and even allows you to copy text, which is always great for multilingual usage. But without those two features it's basically unusable."
"New version is a bit worse than previous one in terms of functions. There is a problems with copy paste, I simply can not see it when I touch the screen as usual. Also my keyboard closing when I press up, down, left or right arrows on it. Would be appreciated if you can fix it. Upd: Now all the color marks disappeared from the file I was reading and pointing important parts, thank you Adobe."
"This app is very useful for when reading PDF files on mobile. However, as an editing tool, it has a very limited font selection. I tried searching the web but I cannot find any means to add even just Arial on the available fonts. Even the Creative Cloud app does not have that feature, or that I couldn't find it in the app. Please do help since this is a very useful app on the go."
"I have noticed recently that the new files are opened in the ""page-by-page"" view mode. I have to say that it is somewhat inconvenient since I'm used to the ""continuous page"" mode. Please add an option that allows us to choose the default view mode. I downloaded some files to the cloud, but some of them are very big that it needs time. Add an option to download in background. I can't select phrases to copy paste as before."
"I don't like the fact before I was able to edit, fill and sign documents before and now for some reason there different the app has subscriptions and I am not allowed to edit my own documents to which I had ability before."
"Bassically all I want is a PDF App that works for chromebooks that has all the features of a windows desktop application. Features that include toolbars or a ribbon that apear at the top of the application, that you can costomise to suit your personal requiremets. An advanced search option, so you can find exactly what you're looking for quickly and easily, without having to go to every page that word or phase appears on! Why is this too much to ask for?"
It's very good and kinda extensive but for if it save you from sending papers through the mail and it saves people from bringing them back to be sign sent by a person I suppose it works be worth the cost.
"It was a good dear to me for a loooooong time, saved my life in uni and high school. But a few years back it started with all those new updates that were unnecessary to me (I only used to read pdfs, so dark mode and reflow were my only requirements). Then reflow got really buggy. The words were cut suddenly, only to appear a few paragraphs later. The sentences were all jumbled. I had to be on continuous mode to read. Now I'm fed up with this and it's time to say goodbye."
"Not good at all, I was excited and now very disappointed, I don't understand why I'll have to pay for a free trial for 7 days."
"I do like the app, how er I find it ridiculous that I have to pay for a feature like rotateing pages."
"Fussy to use and keeps nagging me to ""sign in"". I don't want to sign in. I just want to read a pdf document. Why Adobe have to make it so hard, I don't know."
"Using this on Chrome OS. Unlike Acrobat Reader on all other platforms I have used I cannot print from the open file, really frustrating. I am on a slow internet access and Adobe's desire to convert every document into liquid mode is also frustrating as I see no benefit from liquid mode. I also miss the advanced search feature which allows searching across multiple files. At the moment not a good experience and am now looking for an alternative product."
"Amazing in principle, awful in practice. The limited functionality has caused me hours of work. Highlight coloring is limited to 9. There is no manual saving apart from saving a copy, and the document is supposed to save automatically, but it does not. I have lost many hours of work, as on multiple occasions saving it as a copy would result in saving a previous version rather than the one I am working on. My annotations have disappeared in front of me. Add a manual 'save as' function."
"Please adjust the zoom capacity. There is an interesting feature that allows to transform a pdf to be easier to read on a cell phone, but not all pdf's are convertible. We still have to zoom on a document once on a while (quite often actually) and it doesn't work. Uninstalled the app because I can't work with it!"
"Good for viewing pdfs, but it tries to get you to sign in and give them money!"
"I used to read PDF files everyday. But after the last 2 update, it starts hurting the eyes. The page starts jumping up or down when it hides the menu bar. Now the bookmark is very difficult. Now we have to lot of steps to remove and add bookmark. While reading books using PDF, easily accessible bookmark is a must. Hope you will make and immediate update to bring back bookmark icon on top bar and not to move the page up or down while hiding or unhiding the top bar. An update to an must be to make life easier. Instead last update make it more frustrating"
Provide a facility of tabs most of the time I'm working on multiple PDFs at a time.
"I have been using Reader for a very, very long time. But I have noticed with each subsequent 'update', it comes across as imposing and complicated - - far more so than Reader of years ago that was just an app to open a pdf and read it page by page. Now look at it: bloated, menu-heavy, excessive features (common to all Adobe apps!) , fiddling for page views and orientation etc. Increased automation and features do not necessarily mean a better app, nor a satisfying user experience."
So much better when it wasn't an app. Docs take ages to load and navigate
"It opens pdf well. Because of eyesight, I wanted it to read but doesn't."
Can't open password protected documents even after entering correct password
"Good app, just better if you can navigate through it once you get the hang of it"
Useless app. Such a pain to use and make simple edits.
Some PDFs are loading very slow and my phone's default pdf reader is fast
The best one out there just need a redesign to match material 3
Horrible what's the point of it if you have to pay for so simple a feature
It is very useful app itself when I but I cannot transfer multiple file in Adobe cloud storage. Please solve this.
"It seems that Adobe is obsessed with bringing the users to their cloud by creating deliberately problems to any other mode of operation. I used to be a heavy user of Acrobat on Galaxy tab S3 for editing PDF files. Now it's a complete waste of time. Big files won't open and if they open changes will be lost, giving the notorious spurious message for read only files! Clunky menus everywhere if you don't want their cloud. Uninstall it. There are much better apps out there."
"I don't like this new update. When you try to watch a video in fullscreen without the time bar, you aren't able to click the video again to make it reappear again. You have to exit the vid and then fast forward. If you don't and you start pressing the screen you somehow hit unfollow, like, retweet without knowing because they don't reappear unless you hit the back arrow at the top and then reenter the vid."
"The ""for you"" and ""following"" tabs are broken and unintuitive. Sometimes posts expected to be in the following tab is exclusively shown on the for you page and vice versa. This feature doesn't work well, ruins the feed, and I'd rather have it back to it's original state. Its a good idea but I should be able to toggle it on or off because at it's current state, it makes Twitter feel less responsive"
I generally love this app. However now I'm having issues that so far haven't been fixable. My dms...images won't download. Just shows blank screen with little camera in the middle. Also when I get a dm msg...when I open the preview shows the blue dot but the msg is very old. When I open it it's the new message. Continues to say something isn't right. Try again later. I have done everything recommended and NOTHING works to fix these issues.
"I have an issue with the app & on the web. Not just what I'm following shows up in my feeds but it seems that everything is coming in on my feeds & I don't know how to stop it from happening. I can't get through my feeds without muting everything. Please help me to stop these unwanted posts from showing up in my feeds. Yes, I have gone through my settings & still the problem exists. If this continues I may have no other choice but to deactivate my account to fix this issue. Thanks, Just_Blue_72"
One of my biggest concerns is the unnecessary cropping of images. It worked completely fine before. Another thing is the auto refresh. I hate it when I'm trying to read a tweet or look at an image the timeline refreshes and it's lost. Something I wish was included is that I could go to the search bar on my profile and type a date in and all tweets from that day would appear. It just makes sense
"The recent update is terrible. Why would you move the viewcount of a post to where the like button used to be? So annoying. Also, having 2 separate home pages is nonsensical. It wouldn't be as much of a problem if I didn't have to swap over to the recent posts each time I open the app. Should be a way to only show recent posts instead of some annoying algorithm similar to what Instagram has devolved to. Sad to see so many backward changes instead of improvements."
This update twitter did without me having to update the app. I like double tapping to fast forward or rewind...instead y'all gave me the option to swipe up to a video not even related to the content I was watching. As well as taking away the buffer/streaming bar after clicking on a video. Now 8 can't even fast forward or rewind without exiting the whole video and going back on to watch it from the part I want to see. Trying waaay too hard to be tik tok.
"It's an okay app. It works when it wants to. However, whenever the app updates, I either don't seem to be receiving them or it makes the app buggy. For example, the downvotes feature doesn't appear anymore in comment sections (even though it still exists) and playback speed options don't show up for videos. I didn't even realize this until coming across a Tweet, but apparently closed captions were recently implemented as well, so I haven't been able to fully utilize it. Do better Twitter."
"For months I've been having the same issue — not every time, but enough to be absolutely annoying... I'll try to upload a photo and suddenly the app will crash. Repeatedly give me an error notification, even when I'm no longer trying to use the app. It's annoying and inconvenient. Even restarting my phone doesn't fix the issue most of the time. And yes, I've tried checking for updates and reinstalling the app."
"A few annoying problems. A little message pops up when ever you select messages that says ""cannot receive messages"" and apparently I can still recieve them. Another annoyance is that when i select a video in someone's likes, it snaps me back to the beginning of their likes. Oh and gifs are un-savable, but i think that a problem on all versions. like, through a web browser, it shows up like a low res video."
"I like it a lot! Not too hard to work with! The only issues I have are the inconsiderate and ridiculous amount of promoted advertisements and the unreliability of the app on certain Wi-Fi spots. Otherwise it's pretty good overall. EDIT: The last update seems to have downgraded the overall quality of the app. My main account takes forever to load, and it takes ages to load pages and my feed is a jumbled mess of ads. Please fix this issue"
"Every two weeks or so, sometimes more, sometimes less, for no reason I've been able to ascertain the app starts freezing. The three choices I'm giving are to close the app, wait, or send feedback. I've sent feedback - I've never heard anything back. Everyone I talk to agrees that @TwitterSupport never gets back to them either. Wait doesn't work it just keeps freezing up. So I close the app and it works, but only for minutes, then it freezes again. Eventually I have to uninstall and reinstall it."
"Lately, my keyboard fails to pop up, & what I think is the function that allows you to add to tweets just buffers unless I scroll it up off the screen, then hit the keyboard. It's having issues! Clearing the cache/restarting doesn't always help! I also think that having all functions on a single page would make things run smoother from a technical standpoint. I wasn't having issues until the app was updated to allow us to add to tweets. There must be a better way!"
"The app is still incredibly frustrating to use. Sometimes it just jumps randomly while scrolling. Sending someone a tweet via DM will cause the tweet to open in the browser instead of through the app, which was never an issue before. The forced, very large closed captions are gone, but now I don't even see it as an option anymore. I just know iphone users never have to worry about stuff like this..."
"Pretty vicious app. Lotsa people out to slit your throats if you slip up once. They also just choose to not implement some great quality of life changes like an edit button (and before you tell me why they can't, just add edit logs). And also there ain't any folders in your bookmarks. In turn I have literally thousands in there. In short, be very careful on this site. Edit: Every image I see is replaced with a link. I'll reinstall and see if that fixes it. Edit 2: Fixed."
"Its been quite some time since i have been using the Twitter app and it still has a problem with loading videos. Every now and then it will refuse to load any video in full screen and will only play the whole thing in preview mode. On top of that, in some cases as im viewing videos, looped videos will continue to play after ive left the posts they were on, playing endlessly no matter where in the app I go. This only ceases after exiting the app entirely."
"Not sure what happened, but the app now regularly hits a seeming rendering wall where actions register, but are not drawn or drawn with a stuttering snapshot lag, culminating in crash. Best part? I have to force close it because closing the front end doesn't cut it. Wanna run a notification service in the background? Great! Mind not making integral to the front end stack such that I cannot restart the app without a force close? That'd be nice."
"Twitter is just very buggy application since I've installed it. I've been trying to post some photos of my drawings for example, and Twitter just keeps crashing. It closes out of the app, and ups an error message saying ""Twitter isn't responding"" and will keep repeating the same error message over and over again for about a minute. This is very annyoing, especially when I can't even post anything anymore because of this. And the problem is that no one is trying to fix this."
"For the past two days, I've had to uninstall and reinstall the app, because all of my tweets and my timeline keep disappearing. I also miss the feature where you can activate sounds when someone replies to you. UPDATE: Since an update to the app, it keeps crashing. When I open it, it says ""Oops. Something went wrong. Try again later."" The only fix is to uninstall and reinstall the app. I have to do this. EVERY DAY!!! It's annoying."
Great socialisation poor function. I've used this app for years now. Generally the experience has been fine. However just recently it's become unusable. I'm reinstalling a couple of times a week just to post pics/videos/gifs. It's virtually impossible to change profile pictures now too. I've attempted contact to correct this but there is never any reply. Which would imply the customer service is lacking. I also don't find the report function particularly accurate. This could use more human power
"When i scroll the timeline, it suddenly refreshes itself. It's really annoying. I don't get notification when someone reply my tweet. When i do get notification, it won't stop. I keep getting notification over the same reply. Please fix this. Edited (18/04/23) Don't like the new update. The image crop in timeline is terrible. Also the new video player is so annoying. I can't close the video by flicking up. Instead, random videos appearing. The huge words blocking the video is so uncomfortable"
This new video functionality is awful! Who approved this? Why do I have to press play after opening a video? So inconvenient. And half of the time I can't even pause the video or rewind because the controls just don't appear. I have to press the back button on my phone and then click on the video again to get them to show up. Please fix this! In fact go back to the way it used to be. Twitter doesn't need to be another TikTok. Please. It was perfect the way it was!
24/04/2023 They need for fix the video issue. Once you click on the video and get it to Fullscreen you can't click back to scroll. It's so useless now. Fix that issue and it would be better. Algorithms is off too. Old update the latest updates have not been fixing the issue where we have to quit the app multiple times and re-open it before everything is functional. why does the alignment go out and some features go missing. its annoying having to restart the app constantly
"Why is playing video in the timeline now a multi-tap process? Also, I really dislike having that blue floating bubble at the top of my timeline constantly telling me that there's new stuff up above. It gets in the way of my reading, it's distracting, It's animated, and it's unwelcome. Why can't we disable this kind of stuff. Why are there no customization options for the users at all? 😕"
"Can't unfollow accounts and videos randomly mute while watching. I have tried again and again to try to unfollow accounts that I'm not interested in following anymore. I've tried to unfollow in different places and different devices, but it never works. I have many accounts I don't want to follow anymore, but they keep showing up in my feed. Videos randomly mute while watching, causing me to have to exit full-screen to unmute it only for it to mute again. Tired of having to deal with problems."
"Irritating to use. Replying to a tweet forces you back to the top of the tweet, so you have to scroll all the way back down to continue what you were doing. Your timeline will also spontaneously update while you are looking at something, completely interrupting what you wanted to read."
"Actual value: one star. Bonus star for literally sabotaging the competition because they were beating down the actual twitter app so hard. Lots of long-term issues that haven't been resolved, including odd things like the translate button disappearing when clicked even when the translation fails. Media view is a single column instead of the common tile format because boomers suffer from linear thinking. Ads are weirdly repetitive and don't seem to be well targeted despite access."
"Guys something is wrong with your new update,I can't download the videos at all. I've tried lots of different downloader apps but they all report the same malfunction. It was okay before and I didn't realize it was the new update until later on. I've even considered downgrading the app to get the older version but I can't so I hope a new update is coming yesterday fast which is gonna fix this!"
A recent update broke full screen video controls. You used to be able to tap on the screen to hide or reshow the controls. Now once I hide them I can't get them back unless I exit out of the video and go back in to it which just restarts it. Super annoying
The updated video player is beyond catastrophic. How did it pass QA and UX testing will forever be a mystery for me. Also there's an ongoing bug whereby a page's feed auto scrolls back to the top anytime I click on a media item (image or video).
"Why would you change the video format for TikTok one, I hate so much this format plus the main problem is still there the video player just keeps freezing on 1 frame and the content is totally unreadable. Why would you try to fix something that wasn't broken in the first place !!?"
"The platform & app has very quickly been going downhill (for obvious reasons). App no longer loads any pictures or videos, timeline doesn't refresh or load tweets automatically like it used to, and two-factor authentication is now locked behind a paywall. I miss when Twitter worked right."
"Terrible video player. Let the twitter be as it was before. You can't see the time on video, you lose every control if you dare to see the video in full screen, tge video doesn't resumes from where you leave it. Annoying! Hate this style."
"The app isn't very user-friendly because it's challenging to figure out how to log out. Why do I need to log out? Because I am replying to tweets, and it's doing so in the wrong account because it appears the feature to change which account you post replies to has been removed. PS The app is also highly choppy, and on an S23 Ultra, it should be smooth."
"Can't see any notifications on new comments, mentions, or new likes to my own tweets for weeks now. If I go to my tweet, they're there, but it's not on my notifs in app or pushed notifs. A hot week there I saw ads after every. single. tweet on my timeline. For you page being the automatic tab is garbage. Only good thing is the addition of misinformation alerts under click bait tweets. But honestly, why would anyone use an app they can't engage in?"
I don't really write reviews but this one just really disappointed me. I am an active user of Twitter. This new version is confusing and irritating to navigate. The pinned tabs are so unnecessary. The UI seemed to have downgraded to the lowest. It kinda looked cheap and old. Please revert it back to the previous update.
"I don't want to sound like that guy but ever since Musk took over the app has gone downhill fast. Constant load errors, reshowing the same post up to 6 times, auto-refresh mid scroll, and crashing when composing a tweet. Not to mention the Twitter Blue drama $11 (if paid monthly) to edit a Tweet, get your post ""seen more"", and ""see less ads"". The last two can't actually be proven since we have no metrics. Oh, and maybe be open about the now twice weekly updates and tell us what they're for."
"Video player is UNUSABLE. Bar option disappears, video options dissapear and tapping on the video doesn't bring them back. Bring back the old video player with the option to watch the video over the app as you scroll through Twitter"
It keeps crashing when posting a new tweet or replying to a tweet. This has made the app almost unusable over the past 3 days. My phone wants to put the app in deep sleep because of repeated crashes. Fix this mess!
The last few months there have been so many bugs. When you share a tweet to someone. The link is usually broken and makes you want to log in from the app again. Videos take forever to load or sometimes don't even load regardless of my network speed on mobile data or Wi-Fi. The amount of spam messages I've received is through the roof. I like the idea of all the new features you're adding but focus on the bugs please.
"This app developer is so laid back in fixing bugs. I means there's a ton of bugs there is for users to exploit but the devs doing noting to fix it also there is a problem where the images took so long to load even having a stable connection making it browsing the app unbearable, there's also a problem in saving pictures like hell men it took me 100 tries just to save a single picture. So this app is pretty annoying"
The app is constantly scrolling to the top of a profile after I finish viewing an image. The feed always refreshing on its own is very annoying (it's become even more intrusive than I remember). Often I can be looking at a tweet only to watch it disappear in front of me. This has been the case for many other users
"After Mr. Musk has taken things over, things started to go IMO very wrong. It sometimes seems to me that the whole intention of acquiring this app, was to slowly 'destroy' it. This may be a too strong observation, but certainly nothing positive is going on. And the thing I'm most concerned about, aren't the bugs (though now they are tons of them), but HOW should ANYONE w/ the 'New system' know if an account is authentic or not. Just pay a couple of bucks & you can virtually impersonate anyone!"
"What have you done? Bring back the old video player, now when playing videos you can't skip 5 seconds.. and once you go into a video you also cannot pause or forward using the slider!"
"I used to be a Twitter Blue subscriber until they increased the price. I mean, it's basically over priced now! What you get with new Twitter Blue is pretty much not even really worth the price. If I'm paying $11 a month for new Twitter Blue I want to see zero ads not fewer. And I miss being able to see what platform/device people used to post a tweet. It helped me see if something came from a bot account or not. Also, getting discovered on Twitter is still practically impossible."
"Video Player is really bad; it seems that it's a plan to reduce the app's users or something. 😏 I tried to find something with the same degree of nonsense, but I really couldn't. Update: Another update with zero enhancing. This app doesn't deserve more than 2 stars."
"Too many bugs, one example is the seek bar. If you click a video to watch a it full screen whenever the seek bar disappears it doesn't come back unless you exit and re-enter the video"
My notifications were always touch and go and since the last update (April 3) haven't improved. Worse though now is the task bar at the bottom of the screen which automatically disappears. Extremely annoying and I have to scroll up and pull down again before I can navigate!
"When u play a video it's like you're instantly on a tiktok style layout and there's too much bugs like I can't scroll through the timeline or pause the video, so annoying so please fix this ASAP. PS will change the review when fixed"
"The normal video player is trashed. Videos older than a certain age play at hyperspeed while the audio is normal. This has been like this for months. And I say ""normal video player"" because on ond of my accounts, that horrid player that should only be used for those shorter For You tab videos is used for all videos again. The following feed isn't in chronological order anymore."
Honestly this app sucks... Ever since the last 2 update I can't Fully view Or save any pictures that i've been sent in dms. It also annoyingly takes at least 4 tries for me to even be able to send somebody any pictures. I've had the same problems on the timeline but It doesn't happen as much. I've also had multiple issues with tweets failing to send. I enjoy what has been added to Twitter since Elon took it over but I wish there weren't so many problems...
"Twitter. Why do you change the feed photo layout? If the original picture format is landscape, make it landscape. Now ot looks all portait on me. Really unpleasant. And also please, for the love of god, just remove the auto refresh. Please fix this immediately. Thank you."
"Please, for the love of anyone, FIX notifications on Android! I'll get DM notifications no problem, but any @s or RTs are none existent, to the point I either don't get them at all, or I have to keep refreshing my notifications if I'm currently talking with someone. Been going on for MONTHS now, never used to be an issue. Reinstalled the app several times, even got a new phone - no difference."
"Since last November, hitting some UI buttons (especially the ""show replies"" button) will occasionally and with no pattern that I've been able to discern over the past 4 months open up my camera. Elon Musk must be getting desperate for cash if he's resorting to scraping visual info from ""accidental"" privacy violations. I recommend disabling Twitter's access to your camera in the app settings."
"It's good for keeping up with a few specific types of news, but the algorithm is designed to silo people into auto-generated groups and then show them only content deemed relevant to the group. There's at least one active account I 'follow' shose posts I never see unless I do a specific search. From time to time the app automatically refreshes content, causing the current page of posts to disappear while I'm part way through reading them."
"I lost all my convos following repairing phone. Look into that! I have to keep clicking the back button to the start or close the app to get to home. Change this! Also, give us history like Chrome & forward arrow. Allow us to open different windows to follow different topics. I like the additional tweets option if u have a loooong post 👏👏👏. Lately it feels like security is tight. I even think my posts are disappearing. This is taking away the freedom of the app"
"Currently having a problem with seeing images sent to or from people. When clicking on the pic, nothing shows up. It tries to load but fails. Message icon sometimes shows up or not at all on people's profiles even when following them, quiet annoying. App is having a few issues which need to be sorted"
"The changes in format are odd, the new blue symbols completely eradicated any meaning the official held in the first place. And now, even if I type in the exact @ of a user, I can't find them. Overall, the experience is getting worse."
"I get a blank screen when clicking a tweet alert. Have to back out because it never loads. Also, app freezes at odd times. Don't know if it is being updated in the background or what. Get old tweets dumped in my feed normally during the Fri-Sun timeframe. Get feed from users I don't follow."
"This app is changing far too much and in way too many directions. The timeline now regularly shows you posts from people you don't follow, and something about that is ruining my experience in a way I struggle to describe. Its just... weird now. Twitter is still Twitter, but it's becoming more soulless with every added feature, like view counts, paid checkmarks, and the timeline. I am just waiting for more and more reasons to finally keep me off this site someday."
"Oh boy it's getting worse. Still a fairly functional app but the very smart and clever team is continuously adding features that nobody asked for. The features simply prioritise showing to investors/shareholders how much interactions a Tweet gets (via views, number of bookmarks, etc.) Ought to jump ship soon."
"It's getting worse by the month. Everytime I open the app it bugs out and shows me that I'm logged out and typing in my username and password doesn't work. Once I close the app and reopen it, it's logged in again like it should be. I don't get notifications on time, and now my latest messages in my DM's show older ones."
"I don't like the way twitter got updated in video mode. When we tap the screen, it's always pause the video. Even thought we just want to see the scroll bar or video timer, NOT TO PAUSE THE VIDEO! This is very annoying."
"Every day or two, something different breaks. Might get fixed in hours, might stay broken for weeks. But something new is always breaking. Ads also randomly go between being non-existent and appearing every 3 or 4 tweets in my following feed. Also, the blue checkmarks and confusion between previously verified accounts and Twitter Blue subscribers continues to be a huge problem. I would not pay $8 a month for this given the current state it's in."
"It was a great app before. But the recent changes were absolutely a downgrade. Really despise how irrelevant tweets appearing in the said ""for you"" time line. Can we like, get rid of it? I'm not interested at all with those irrelevant tweets there. Also, bring back moment! That's one of your best features in a while!"
"App feels very sluggish lately and the app sometimes freezes and stops responding. As others have also pointed out, the video player is broken. Sometimes videos play super fast and skip parts, sometimes video just freezes (but sometimes audio will keep playing)"
"It getting uncomfortable these days. When i clicked the link under a video, it goes to the account profile, not the original tweet of the video. The notification for DM is often lagging. I can't open the pic sent in my dm too. The newest update is inconvenient. Hope twitter can fix this asap."
"Samsung Galaxy S20 and S22 Ultra user. Most of the time my tweeted photos have a strange visual fragmenting issue showing up at the bottom of the image after uploading. Any suggestions? Update: Recent obvious changes are breaking the app. Watching the slow, downward spiral of the only social media platform I use."
I believe that the efficiency of Twitter has decreased in the last few months. I think the user experience can be enhanced more and the general standard of Twitter has fallen short of my high expectations. I look forward to seeing improvements in the app soon.
I used to like this app very much but recently if i am reading a thread then it'll automatically scroll up or maybe disappear from the time line! It glitches so much too. It won't let me see the quotes too and this app start glitching for no reason. Really very irritating.
"They did this video player update before and had the good judgement to reverse it. Now, for some reason, they changed the video player again. It's simply terrible. Just leave the regular video player."
"I have used Twitter for so many years, and not even a glitch has happened. But recently, i got a new phone, downloaded the app, signed into my account, and now when i try to play a video or view an image the app crashes. What's going on??? Please get this fixed as soon as possible - then you'll get your five stars back"
"Why does the timeline refresh automatically in the middle of scrolling?! I'm trying to read a tweet and it randomly disappears and new tweets appear in its place. When I open a tweet and then go back to the timeline, all the tweets below the opened tweet get refreshed and new tweets appear in their place. This is an extremely annoying experience. Fix it!"
"I've been using Twitter since 2014 and they haven't still fixed the photo quality while uploading the profile picture. I cannot even keep my full body pictures as my pfp because it makes the pictures all look blurry. Also, the timeline gets refreshed by itself everytime. Please fix this, I'm tired."
"This app is so broken LOL and they keep changing/removing functions that already worked, adding features no one wants or asked for, etc. The new FYP is useless. Notifs are glitching. A few days ago I noticed that my drafts were wiped 🫠 and no, I had not logged out or uninstalled/reinstalled the app. They just disappeared and Twitter has not addressed the issue, despite hundreds of people alerting them and asking why this happened."
"Those recent Elon-mods are making the application quite bad - it is less stable, more overcrowded with bots and much less appealing. And after that ""blue mark confusion"" it is also absolutely untrustworthy. All in all - completely broken. Twexit is nigh!"
"Tried to create an account, didn't work. It said my email was already in there. Then I tried to log in but I couldn't remember my password, but then I had to put in the username which I also didn't remember. And then the phone number option isn't working also. I wish it had an option about forgetting your username, like almost every other app does"
"Doesn't open right... Upon clicking a Twitter link in other apps and clicking to switch apps, it just keeps going to the Google play stop and not opening. Sometimes it does work, but it's been getting harder to get it to work correctly."
For you section is unusable for me. I get random twits in which I have no interest. Another major issue is that video playback gets stuck. Even though I'm connected to high speed broadband the videos keep on loading.
"I've been us8ng this app since forever but lately there is many problems that been bugging me and one of them is that I can't share any tweets to ig story anymore. when I click on share to ig story, it just did nothing at all and no matter how many times I've tried. it won't work, pls fix this. it would mean a lot to me 😭😭"
"While watching a video i can no longer press on the screen to view the user interface or videos contols. Meaning i cant forward, rewind or pause videos."
"This app is literally turning into a steaming pile of 💩 Features continue to break even though they were working perfectly fine before. Anytime Elon gets in Kahoots with another company or person of importance features get disabled or they are ""delt with."" Twitter is starting to look like a massive cash grab.. you're literally paying them to break the app or just make it worse in general."
"Since the last update my drafts keep disappearing this has happened twice in the last week , this never use to happen and also videos keep stopping but the audio carries on . Please rectify these or put it back to how it was ."
"App randomly removes, refreshes, and/or pushes down tweets when I'm in the middle of reading them. This gets annoying after a while. Usually not able to locate the original tweet i was reading when this happens."
"I just opened my app to read a notification from our local fire department & couldn't due to this message: ""Only Twitter Blue subscribers can use the text message two-factor authentication method. It’ll just take a few minutes to remove it..."" Since WHEN does an app CHARGE for this security feature when E-V-E-R-Y-W-H-E-R-E else has it for FREE!?! 😡 Also, the app has been sluggish lately and I'm so unimpressed with the CEO & upper management of this app tbh!"
"Genuinely the most broken app I've used. It didn't use to be so bad, but now it seems like it breaks and crashes on a near weekly basis. I haven't been able to tweet through the app for days now. How do you mess up the literal main feature of the app?? For multiple days no less?? Garbage. Elon ruined this platform so bad, it's insane"
"Pictures and videos are getting stretched out and don't fit properly on the screen, making tweets extremely long and being forced to open the media to read or watch it."
"Twitter used to be simple and reliable. But sign on, authentication, IDs, passwords have all been riddled with problems over the past few months. Add in the bots, hate speech, threats and sheer ignorance and it's really a PITA now."
Can you PLEASE fix random tweets on the dashboard disappearing or jumping to the top? Also sometimes it just randomly teleports you to the top of the dashboard for no discernable reason. It is incredibly frustrating please fix this
"Recently there have been features added that just make me want to find a different platform. The ""for you"" isn't want I would like to see. I read 1 tweet for too long then that's all my fyp. But also if I find a tweet super entertaining but takes less than a minute to read and laugh it doesn't matter. BUT THEN the follow page doesn't even have the capacity to load a days worth of tweets. At this point its the equivalent of MySpace waiting for a Facebook to launch"
This app is so bad now. Its always buggy. It crashes so much and i always get the same tweets on my timeline even after I refresh. My timeline is always full of things im not interested in but for some reason it thinks i am and keeps suggesting random topics.
"My ""for you"" pages is a list. It stays in the same order and only nee rings are added from the too. But I'm tierd of seeing the same thing I had already. Why not make a ""discover"" section. The button would be at the bottom of the phone, like ""search"" has. The algorithm will decide what you like. I know I basically telling you to make something like reels and tiktoks but this has a bit of Twitter to it. It will have posts, videos and images, not just videos."
"The present app version keeps too much time to open in My realme device.. often it shows message ""the contents are not available now ,please retry later""..the latest tweet are not displayed..Very bad experience in new version..tried changing settings but no help..only option left is to uninstall.."
"Toxic. While there some great content, and content creators, it's too hard to sift through all the ""hot takes"" and rage farming. I suppose if you enjoy be angry all the time, then this is the app for you. It sure helped open my eyes to a wider world, but one that is full of anger and misplaced energy."
"this app is pretty pathetic at this point. can't scroll down main page w/o the feed refreshing halfway if i blink too fast, getting suggested content that i swear i've said ""i don't like"" and picked to ""see less of this"" but determinedly stays regardless of what i do. i've had to start muting accounts and i rarely do that so that tells you all you need to know"
"It's been going downhill after you-know-who for average users, I can't imagine what's it's like for creators and small businesses. Privacy is no longer secured, likes disappear, the same 5 posts cycle over and over with maybe one new post showing up every once in a while, the user experience is simply no longer worth it. The ""for you"" and ""following"" tabs are insanely disfunctional as well."
"Dumpster Fire in Progress. Twitter has become scattered, unreliable (I've had to uninstall and reinstall several times), and repeatedly serves content I am not interested it. Behaves more like a spam app. Definitely not the same."
App has started to become broken it seems. Direct messages aren't updating like they should. I see in the direct message main window a message from 30 minutes ago and it shows as recent.
"Videos don't run properly, can't send messages to people from their profile, timeline refreshes midway through scrolling, can't 'Like' a post while viewing it, no email address for help/support if solution isn't provided in Help Centre. If you want people to continue using this app, you have to actually fix the bugs and implement functions that are actually useful. Another pro-tip: get rid of Elon."
Customer service is an absolute joke. The paid subscription seem to be a scam. I paid $10 for a particular account's tweets and I was never able to view them. I only received an error indicating I had already paid for the service but was unable to view it. Upon request from Twitter for help with my issue or a refund they proceeded to gaslight me via email for half a month playing stupid and repeatedly asking me for the same info that I was providing. Never pay for Twitter only read free Tweets.
"Used to love this app, have been using sound cloud for 8+ years, however the last few months the app has become unusable. Constantly crashing saying ""there was a problem with soundcloud."" As others have said it cuts off all the time, sometimes multiple times per song. Can't really get any cleaning done if you are constantly going back to your phone to hit ""play"" again (which sometimes doesn't work and you have to exit the app entirely). I'm going to have to remake all my playlists in Spotify."
"The mobile app is very unreliable. Constantly doesn't output sound randomly but still shows it as playing, nearly every song I don't actually hear the first 3-5 seconds of audio and it acts more like a social network than music app. Just figured I'd give it a try for the 30 days but only made it about a week and it's just too annoying just dealing with it. Works great on a computer but unfortunately, mobile is what really matters. Great when it actually works."
Long time user and have loved this app but the ads have started to become overwhelming. It's every three songs in my liked playlist and sometimes it's 2 ads back to back. It really has dampened the user experience. I'm sure it's to push for people to upgrade. Prior to recent updates the ads were spaced out more and were tolerable. It would more come up when searching for music and not so much on my playlists. Not anymore unfortunately. Update: it's gotten worse. 2 stars.
"Signed up for the no ads plan and it popped up a screen saying""things are different in a good way"" so I push start listening and nothing happened for 45 minutes so I uninstalled and reinstalled which I shouldn't have to do and sign back in to make it work just to find out I can't control the quality of the audio. So I ""upgraded"" my plan and once again popped up the same screen saying ""things are different..."" So I skipped the start up screen by uninstalling and reinstalling Extremely Irritated!"
Soundcloud is definitely my favorite way to stream music. But I've been having issues lately (strictly in the mobile app) where the music just paused for no reason whatsoever. Idk why it happens but it's really annoying. Update: I figured out how to prevent my phone from putting it to sleep automatically. If this stops happening I'll definitely correct this rating.
I loved this app but it started giving me trouble recently and I've tried everything to fix it. It says track added to playlist but then when I go to the playlist it says 0 tracks and the song won't show up. Super frustrating since I use music when I ride it helps my horse get used to sounds but I can't do that now because this is the only app that works...well was. Please fix it
"Not only does the app randomly pause a song in the middle of playing, but the ads are getting as bad as YouTube. Two ads at a time, and if it's not after every song, then it's after every other song. I understand you gotta make money from the ads, but they are way too frequent for a music app."
"Why is it that half of your liked songs just completely vanish? It isn't even that I forgot to like the song either , I'll look it up after not seeing it in the list and it will show that I did indeed like it . And sometimes this means the song is lost forever if you don't remember the name of the song , too compound on the issue recently played is a mess that only shows playlists ; some of which are SoundCloud weekly playlists that are on a timer , so often it's goodbye to songs indefinitely.."
"Good for listening to music for free, but the amount of ads has skyrocketed lately. I get two songs then two ads then one song then another ad and it's past annoying, its just infuriating. Sometimes I'll get an ad, skip the song that comes after it, and get more ads! This is not at all convincing me at all to get the OVERPRICED subscription, in fact at this point I might just stop listening to music at all. Download only if you're okay with constant repetitive ads every 5 minutes."
"My only problem (and an important one, I think) is that you can't add multiple tracks to a playlist. You have to add them each individually which us ridiculous when you want to add dozens of tracks at once. Plus if you were to just play the tracks themselves (like a podcast series) you can't play them in order of upload (1st to last). You have to play them in reverse (last to 1st). This has been a known problem for at least a year and it doesn't look like that's going to change."
"New update sucks. There is no longer a back button on the lock screen. You have to fully turn on your device and swipe down on the notification, which is very inconvenient when you're doing something and listening to music at the same time. I am on Motorola. Please fix. While I'm at it please also add some settings for playlists, such as being able to choose if new songs are added at the top or bottom of the playlist."
I used to really love using the app. The ads never got too annoying and I could easily put playlists together. What made me undownload it was the fact that it kept crashing every minute or every two songs. I would have to sit there and babysit it for it to make it through three songs only for it to crash again. Not to mention sometimes it would just stop and refresh the entire playlist making me lose the song I was playing in that playlist.
I've recently started using soundcloud again but now it seems nearly impossible to control the music player and where it starts. I'm not sure if anyone else has this glitch but for some reason the orange song bar player starts at the end for some reason. The orange bar player shows up as if the song ended making it nearly impossible to seek back to the beginning. This is especially frustrating if someone has made compilation of tracks into one. Because of this I had no choice but to Uninstall.
"I use this app all the time for listening to music, and it seemed pretty great, but recently there has been a huge increase in ads. On average, there's at least one ad every song, and to say that it is annoying is an understatement. Please fix this! I am aware with plus you can get rid of ads all together, but even without it I rarely got ads."
"Have all my favorite music but, it glitches a lot and also kinda slow. Also, the music keeps pausing by itself, so please fix that. As well the music keeps saying I can't play it even though I have my own, and is already connected to WiFi! So please, fix this since this is my favorite app to use! For now, it'll be rated to two stars, if this continue, I'll have to lower it."
"I don't suggest using this app. Most of the songs I tried to search up are not even found. If you're searching for good songs, you have to pay to listen to them. I thought this app would have all the songs I liked, but so far, it's only useful for anime songs and that took me literally a whole hour since I didn't know what Spotify was. This whole app only gives you covers of stupid people singing horribly and horrendous quality. If you don't want to waste your time fixing this whole app, I suggest you use Spotify first. Then, I'll see if Spotify gets better. I know my opinion doesn't really count, but I just explained everything that would happen if you download this app."
"I use this app only because it organizes the podcasts I listen to so nice. That's its only strong suit. Everything else about it is pretty crappy. It randomly turns off at times. If I get a phone call in the middle of listening to a podcast, it won't turn back on when I'm done. That's not that big of a deal, but what does get annoying is that the shortcut on the pull down screen will disappear and the podcast starts over so I have to go back and figure out where I left off which is pretty annoying when I have work to do."
"Awesome app with a descent selection of music and wide variety of talented rappers. One thing that really bugs me though is that the music will every now and again stop and won't be playable until you reset the app. It'd be awesome if they could fix it so that the people who wouldn't mind paying for the subscription wouldn't have to deal with a critical bug like this one, but aside from this major nuisance it's a nice app platform."
"As a music source Souncloud is great & the low price no commercial option is a great alternative to other services. However, the app itself sucks. It crashes at least once a day, randomly rearranges & deletes songs from playlists, and is an overall pain in my lower anatomy (& has been so since I started using it over a year ago). Edit: It sometimes helps if you uninstall & reinstall, but you need to do it every few days. that seems to speed it up when it's running at slug speed."
"I used to enjoy soundcloud but recently, every single time my phone is turned off, it logs me out and I have to log back in. I also have problems with the app closing in the middle of certain songs and such. It's not the app crashing because it's the same songs each time. It is also really difficult to find the original song. I just find many covers or remixes. It gets annoying. I will not be using Soundcloud again till they can fix at least the first two problems."
"This app used to be fine, but now I get occasional to frequent crackling noises during playback on my Galaxy Note8. All my other media playing apps don't have this issue, so it's definitely an issue with SoundCloud. I've cleared the cache, reinstalled the app, and restarted my phone to no avail. I really hope this gets fixed, despite the very few amount of people experiencing this issue. It pretty much makes the app useless for us, but I'll keep it installed in case it gets fixed."
"Not that good but it's the only one I know of. When I first got this, is was one of the best music apps. However, recently, the app stops its music seemingly at random, and ads are everywhere (note: it's usually a 30 second ad every time, every 2-3 songs. Sometimes, there two 30 second ads.)Even on songs that wouldn't be getting ads, yet here we are. The app has continuously been downgrading and at this point I would consider switching to Spotify, if Spotify allowed more than one skip a day."
"Soundcloud is a great app but i have been having problems with it for the pass 3 years. First, is that often i cannot pause or play my music at my request because either it says, ""not playable""(even though its playing) or it lags on me and is frozen. Secondly, over the years my Souncloud has been lagging significantly more than the first time i downloaded it. All I want is that they change the lagging issues when I change songs."
"Not a consistent platform. Too many commercials. Can't listen to full songs without paying a fee. The commercial inconsistency has me wanting to pay for the service, but I cannot see that it offers any benefit for paying. I get full songs off Spotify and Pandora already, SoundCloud isn't up to date with any music except mixes. Which are good, don't get me wrong, but that is all it is good for. From what I can see. I'm also not a mixer, so that may be an attraction to those that mix a lot."
"For some reason after 30-150 seconds the app closes while it's playing music in the background when I'm playing games on my phone and I keep having to get back on it go off it and get right back on again. I've tried restarting the app and closing it,, but that doesn't work, it keeps happening and it's been happening for the past MONTH now. It's tedious, annoying, and agitating when I'm trying to relax when I'm done having a stressful day. Please fix this and I'll rate 5 stars."
"While the app itself works fairly smoothly, SoundCloud itself is clearly on it's last legs. I feel as though I am listening to more ads than actual music when I use the app. I completely understand that money needs to be made to keep this platform afloat, but the amount of ads has killed the entire service for me. It's hard to justify paying for the premium version as well, when services such as Spotify and Google Music offer so much more for the same price."
"I never really write reviews. But, SoundCloud use to be my favorite song app and I always recommended to friends. I liked it so much that i wouldn't care about the ads here and there. But now, they just made it so that most of their songs you need to buy Go+ to listen to now. I had to take off over 100 songs off my play list because it would cost. And they had the audacity to still play ads even after making most of their songs Go+."
"Autoplay gives you no choice in stations after your selection. I listen to interviews, sermons, meditations, etc. to help me fall asleep. After I fall asleep, loud Dance Club Pop music is suddenly playing at 3am, waking me up! Argh. I am not following any like that. There is no way to block certain genres or limit your autoplay to the type of music, people, or groups you follow, and marked favorites. Complaints about it in the blog go back 4 years, and they still have not fixed it."
"I love soundcloud a lot but it's not the same. I remember a few years ago, there werent any ads and there were only a few glitches (if that), but now, there are ads every 2-3 songs and there are sooo many bugs and glitches. Sometimes while I'm listening to my playlist, it'll just glitch and start from the beginning when the playlist or album isnt even over and its annoying. I wouldn't complain if it just happened a few times, but its constantly happening."
"The app is good and has been good since I've used it. However, when it comes to using it on the samsung a11 the notifications go bonkers. I tried playing music with my sound notifications on so that if anyone texted me I'd hear it but instead all I heard was my notification sound because of the playback notification. It would not stop too, while playing the song the notifications would go absolutely insane and I couldn't even hear the song in the background. Not like that would be any better."
"The latest updates are a pain to use. My biggest problems would probably be considered minor to a developer but annoying as a listeners. *Ads play too constantly, They play after 2 songs for me. * ""Discover"" Tab songs do not appear on history. * Has a habit of crashing when doing anything else while a song is switching. Only reason why I use the app is because it has more ease-of-access than using a browser."
"This app is not completely free. It will only let you listen to the first 10 seconds of a song on an album. It will not let you listen to the whole song on any album. You have to subscribe to their premium plan in order to do that. Spotify let's you listen to whole albums free. This app however is compatible with my SD card but spotify is not. But, despite that I'm still sticking with spotify because it let's me listen to albums free."
"I've used it for quite awhile now, but recently it's been having issues. These issues are honestly triggering. The first one that gets on my nerves the most is, when I go to a certain app the music will completely shut off. The second one is, is that it will randomly pause what I have playing and then shut off the app once more, the last one is that, in my liked tracks it will randomly change what I had playing to something completely different. I would rate this 5 stars but rn it's staying as 2"
"Way too many ads. 5 minutes of music then a ad is way to often. On top of the random song shuffling even when you manually move a song. Not to mention lack of control like a ""clear queue"" button. The only thing it has going for it is that this app allows me to listen, although rarely, to my fav artist. The PC soundcloud is much better."
"I've been using Soundcloud for years as a listener and as time has gone by there has been a lot more ads and they're very restricting. With some ads, if you tab out while the ad is playing, it will pause, forcing you to essentially watch the ad. I haven't seen an ad where you can skip it in a long time either. There's a bunch of bugs now such as not being able to go to the next song or pause the current song on your lock screen. Definitely not what it use to be."
"Lots of issues lately. Won't play any songs, ignores my subscription, like right now it's frozen. Just updated on the 17th, now it's updating again and it's been 10 minutes with it supposedly ""updating"". When it DOES work, to play any good songs you gotta have a subscription. You can't download any songs with it though it says you can but once your subscription is over the songs won't play so there's no benefit of having a subscription. Other apps are free with free downloads to keep. Pass."
"when I use SoundClick the clarity of the recordings comes out better. last week the house icon used to bring up other people's music and the lightning bolt would bring up mine and others... that's working opposite this week. I attempted to share a song with a copy link and it didn't work, when I went back I couldn't even find the song again. I was just listening to it!!! a search brings up other people's... then I have to wait through commercials... I just turn the volume all the way off."
"The app was really nice when I first downloaded it, I can just choose any song I wanna listen to unlike spotify and most music apps, when the 2 30 second ads keep popping up and the constant ""get soundcloud premium"" I didn't really care. I didn't mind in the first part. But it was not when I would turn on my phone while listening to music to try to pause the music or try to see what the next song was it, automatically skipped the song JUST TO PLAY AD'S. That was the annoying part."
"It works perfectly fine apart from the constant VIDEO advertisements. I wouldn't be complaining about this if it didn't use my mobile data everytime one of these ads play. This app is not the same as it used to be, I suggest not using SoundCloud if all you want to do is listen to a select few songs. They've also moved the replay option which I often use, to a more inconvenient location."
"Great when it works. The ads about anti-vaping get annoying, but I can live with that. It's the fact that after playing 3 or 4 songs, the app just breaks. You can still scroll around and search and everything, but the music player will not play music. The only way to fix it is to force close the app. Very annoying"
"If it weren't for the content I can only find on SoundCloud, I would ditch this app in a heartbeat. It has been the most broken music player I've ever used, breaking perpetually during normal use. The only time it doesn't break is if you set a playlist/station and leave the app in the background. With each update, the specifics of when things break changes but ultimately, it's been like this the year+ I've used this app."
"Favorite music streaming app but some things are buggine me. When a track ends it doesn't play the next song if my phone is closed, if it's open it plays but stops after about 15 minutes. If I'm listening to a mix it stops playing after about 20 minutes. Not sure what happened to the app, has worked fine for the last 4-5 years. If they fix this issue I'll change my rating but right now it's a terrible app for streaming."
"The underrated songs on here are the best but any other kinds of songs wont work. I've been using this app for years now and about half of my favorite songs are ""unavailable"" or GO+. Not to mention the repetition of the ads. Constant, after every. Single. Song. And a lot of the time it's 2 ads in one go. Also, you cant skip them anymore! So annoying."
"I used to have no problems with this app, but recently I've had beef with some of the gradual changes. Sometimes when I try to fast forward to another part of a song, it warps ahead to the next song instead and plays an ad. And... going to the home menu pauses ads? Really? I can't even resume or pause songs/ads outside of the app itself because the toolbar that used to be in the notifications menu just disappeared with one of the past updates. I'd say more if it weren't for the character limit."
"Another website ""app"" that somehow doesn't run nearly as well as the website itself. Often crashes/freezes or makes phone unresponsive.  Great when it does work but will likely hang mid-stream for no apparent reason. Probably too busy data-mining your phone.& providing additional ""exclusive features"" that nobody uses or asked for to begin with.  Probably runs better on the newest phones when there's enough memory to accommodate the bloatware."
"This used to be a great app. I'd use it all the time until it started just shutting down out of no where. I'm usually in another tab while listening to some music, ( Keep in mind a lot of the applications I use don't have sound so I'm almost positive it's not them. ) but now I can't be in another tab for half of a song until it turns off and SoundCloud just crashes. I've tried to look through settings but this doesn't seem to be a mode. SoundCloud is good besides that, though. Please fix this."
"It has been glitching out where when listening to your playlist, it will play songs that aren't on there. Even if there are songs after the one listening to. Playing completely random songs that don't make sense. I skip through every song because it's not my taste and it's become a annoying thing. It's happened more than once"
"I've used this app for a long time, and I think overall the service is great. But this app is incredibly unstable on all devices I use it on. It should be easier to use, but I constantly run into bugs. Suddenly the app will crash, or the music will stop playing, or when I want it to skip it will skip to the wrong section. And believe me, I've tried everything under the sun to stop these problems. To sum it up, it can be very unreliable as a music app."
"Great selection — poor cross platform integration. The developers absolutely are missing an opportunity by not porting their application into Android Auto. More than half to two-thirds of my time spent listening music is while driving. I love SoundCloud's selection, over that of Spotify, but will replace it with a competitor who can make the leap."
"Absolutely horrid app. When it works it works fine, but that's so rare that it may as well not happen at all. The app lags and freezes constantly, it takes more than 10 seconds to skip a song, and songs will often refuse to play so I have to open the app and manually skip it. The buttons on the android player will also change spots at random, so I cant just use muscle memory to skip a song, because it might unlike a track instead. I spent 30 mins trying to get it to work today. I've had enough."
"When I first started using this app about 5 years ago, I loved it. Such an easy way to listen to music. With that being said, this is NOT the same app that it used to be. There is an ad between every song (sometimes 2) and half the music requires a premium account. I understand that artists need to be supported but this is going too far. Why am I listening to more ads than I am songs?? Surely its not for the artists who keep all their music for premium users. Overall wouldn't recommend"
"Long term app and SoundCloud+ user! Just recently, it seems like the app has issues when downloading songs to my phone. The app freezes when I go to the Downloads settings page. I have tried to clear cache, reinstall, switch wifi and nothing seems to be working. And will continously attempt to start downloading tracks but it just gets stuck on song 1 of N tracks. I have a debug report ready to send if needed."
"Okayyyy, Im starting to get highly annoyed with this application. It does not let me listen to my music at all unless im on the app and whenever i turn my phone off, the music cuts off. This is supposed to be an app about listening to music whilst still being able to be on other apps, correct? Then please fix it. Besides that, The app is just wonderful."
"this app used to be good. now I have to listen to a 30 second commercial for every 2 songs I want to listen to. WITH NO SKIP OPTION. you used to be able to listen to at least 4 songs with a 15 second ad in between that you could skip after the first few seconds of playing. I understand the need to generate income to support a ""free"" format (I'm mean, honestly, if I'm forced to listen to commercials it's technically not ""free"") but this is ridiculous. I'll stick to spotify"
It's a pretty good app for listening to songs. A weird thing that happened was that songs I could listen to before suddenly became not available in my country? I found that odd so I tried to find a way to fix it but to no avail. I'm assuming it's a bug? For now though it stays on hold until it becomes playable again. It sucks cause they were really good songs too.
"SoundCloud is generally great, but nothing more frustrating than refusing to stream a set (for unknown reasons) you've had your eyes on. Icing on cake? After being forced to add it to a playlist to try and download it, the app asks me to give it a rating. Hmm. Typically both a great app and service, disappointed by this behavior."
"I understand some ads; you have to make money somehow, but every two or three songs? The back button doesn't work unless I use the skip button first, which always leads to an ad, which leads me to believe it's bugged on propose. Add a repeat button and program it to play ads after a certain number of repeats or something. The app is pretty buggy when I'm listening to a podcast and lose reception; the track becomes ""unplayable"" when I get reception back."
"SoundCloud was perfect for the first 30 days that I had it, but after that mark, they slap you with a ""free trial has ended"" screen and forces you to either pay $10 a month or have most the songs be 30 second previews, the app runs well and if you have money to spend, it is the best choice, but if you want a nice free music service, go to Spotify."
"The app isn't designed for regular podcast listening, only random sampling of podcasts. They're listed highly chaoticly, and there's NO DATES for the episodes. As best I can tell, there's not all that many episodes available. But with the disorder and total lack of dates, it's not easy to tell. No one who is serious about following any podcast could use this app. It didn't have ANYTHING I was looking for, including music stations. You have to pay just to listen to much for music."
"terrible. I have all my music downloaded, and it was working perfectly fine before, and now all of a sudden its broken. I can only play one song, and then the app starts telling me the track is not avalible and to check my connection when ONE: my stuff is downloaded. why would i need wifi for it to play when its downloaded? and TWO: the wifi is PERFECTLY FINE. theres no issues and ive even reset the router! EDIT: once my subscription ends, im moving back to spotify. garbage app, not recommended."
"I really like using sound cloud on the days I'm walking around in school, but lately there's been a problem where when an ad starts playing, the video slows down and becomes glitchy, and the video let's out a REALLY loud static noise that can be heard through my ear buds, even on the lowest volume setting. I don't know why this is happening but it's become extremely annoying to deal with. Unless there is a way to fix this, I won't be using sound cloud again."
"Great app for non-mainstream music, but video ads on a music app is too toxic. Nothing more annoying then getting a video ad when you go to switch songs that won't allow you to continue unless you let it play to completion. Also I noticed this app downloads ads in the background since I get them playing in the subway where there is no service. So have unlimited data for this app. Please go back to audio only ads. Nobody pays attention to the videos."
"Been using this app for a while and has been a noticible decline in responsiveness and increase in crashes. Unable to stop/resume songs, unable to skip, unable to scroll and becomes full out unresponsive after listening to just one song. My phone also starts lagging if I want it playing in the bg and sometimes, I am unable to properly close the app. I use an S7. Am pretty disappointed as I used to enjoy listen on this app but now it's become unusable."
"Usually its fine, but recently I've had some issues with my playlist. It will play the first song, but then it will play some random song that I've never heard of before. Its really frustrating. So naturally, I try to find answers. I go on their website, only to find no suitable answer for my issue. So, I figure ill try to contact them. Here's the thing though, YOU CAN'T. there is NO WAY to report bugs or problems. And that email under developer contact? DISABLED. the issue is ongoing, help."
"I really enjoy the music on this app, however the ads have increased exponentially. It used to be that most popular creators 'might' get an ad on their track. Now every track will play 1 or more ads if the previous song was listened to long enough. I understand the moderate use of advertisements, but there are just way too many. This can be avoided with a subscription, however the subscription cannot be cancelled from the app, you require computer access."
"No Android Auto support. No option to repeat/loop the track you are listening to, unlike the desktop version (that I can see). Also, ads have become way too frequent. I love that there is a community of new and aspiring musicians posting their music, I love discovering new music, but the recent increase in the frequency of ads makes the 'free' tier nearly unusable and provides for a terrible overall experience."
"This app really has the largest music library which was the reason I landed here. The app is also great with various subscriptions options available for you to satisfy your budget needs. However, why the majority of the songs are play at high speed audio? There should be an option to control the audio speed. In conclusion, the app has great potential but need to fix the audio speed, since no song is enjoyable at high audio speeds"
"It's a great concept & has so much potential for greatness but for an app that has been around for a long time, it has not grown or improved much at all. Literally every single song recommendation is a fail. My feed is cluttered with awful music suggestions & genres that I can't stand and have zero interest in listening to and there's no way to personalize it. Also, the uploads can't really be organized other than making playlists so it's just a big mess of random songs with no personalization."
"I listen to podcasts on here. For some reason it makes it really difficult for me to start back up where I left off. if I pause an episode and then I try to play it again, it plays from the very beginning. Not to mention it does not keep track of what episodes I have listened to within a playlist. Take a note from YouTube playlists and do what they do."
"I am uninstalling it to go back to just the website. It's missing truly rudimentary features like disabling autoplay, repeat, and replaying the current track, which for someone who likes to deeply analyze their music is an unworkable mess. I gave it two stars because it does, in fact, work, in that it will play stuff from soundcloud without issues, but it's not worth anything more than that. The website is way better, even on mobile."
"This was a great app a couple years ago but since the last updat and other recent ones it been going down hill. i can deal with the ads but, since lowering the bit rate of the audio the quality is terrible on high performance headphones and sound systems. Ince the last update ive not been able to change songs in my likes list. I go to pick another song and it just returns to the previous song i listened to unless i choose from my listening history or the artist's profile. Pixel 2 XL"
"So I've been using soundcloud for a couple years now, and it's always been great. But for a couple of months now the music just stops at random and I play games on my phone while listening to music so I have to close the game app open soundcloud again and start it up again and this will happen a lot and honestly it's getting annoying 2 stars is being nice 1 is more accurate because it messes with me. Please fix this bug"
"Well, the app is decent. There seems to be more ads coming than usual, probably every 2-3 songs. I use this app almost daily whenever I'm on the bus. But the problem is that sometimes a song won't play. At all. It'll just say ""Track can't be streamed"". So I have to go look for another song to play. Fix this sorry excuse of a music app."
"Soundcloud used to be great on android, but lately the app has become very glitchy and annoying to use. The music would randomly stop and you would have to restart the app. When you're ordering your queue and trying to move a song lower, it pushes towards moving it up. The app has been crashing a lot more. And the amount of spam and self promoters is terrible. And the bots are really annoying for new artists. Its to a point that now I only stay for the artists"
"It's a great music app, but it's biggest problem is sometimes, a track will be deleted or unplayable on my likes list, and when I try to take it off, it comes back. No matter how much I unlike the track, it comes back, I even got a track to zero likes, and it came back on my likes list. SoundCloud, please fix this or tell me how to fix it."
"I really do love soundcloud, ive been using it since like 2014 and I pay for the premium verision, which is more than $10 a month. That makes it even more frustrating that the app is almost unusable. Its incredibly slow at everything! Searching, bringing up menus, making playlists, literally every function of the app moves in slow motion. It also completely stops working sometimes until I force stop the app. I really prefer this to spotify but it gets harder as the app gets more unbearable."
"I mean it's better than Spotify? But practically anything is better than Spotify, so that's not saying much. One thing I absolutely hate are the ads. Most of are 30 seconds and unskippable. You also cannot log out of the app without the ad going away; you can't get rid of them. You also cannot download music you bought without having like soundcloud premium or what it's called, which is a huge let down. One thing I do like though is the freedom to customize pretty much anything."
"Well tbh, the app is a great place to listen to music but there are way too many garbage ads. I get you need to have them there to make money or something, but it ruins the mood you're in while listening to music. I've been in bad mood before where all I wanna do is just listen to my music, and I get the dumbest ads ever that just makes me feel worse, and I dont even have money so I cant pay for your premium or anything. Just have less ads that arent between every like 2-3 songs"
"This used to be my favorite music app because they had all the obscure indie songs I really like, but for months now when I let it play, it will either get through about 3 songs with no issues, then stop playing, glitch out, skip, and all kinds of issues. This or it will not play smoothly at all as if I dont have internet connection or something. I'm truly heartbroken over how far this app has fallen since I first joined a few years ago and I've been looking for new apps lately because of this."
"The service is pretty good, everything around it isn't great. You cannot use the app if there's an ad. I understand why they exist, but if you accidentally click on something and start playing music and an ad comes up. You're stuck. You have to force quit the app in order to use it again unless you wait however long the ad is in order to do what you were trying to do. At least make it how YouTube does it and allow you to minimize it. The UI isn't very intuitive either."
"Update: as of 2/15/21 all playback is stuttered and eventually just stops. Hope there's a fix to this soon because I can't listen to anything. it's a great free app, but with it being free it comes with a lot of nuisances. you have to download an entirely seperate app just to see up to date info on your songs...can't change your profile or background picture on either apps...it needs some love but it's still a great free platform."
"I have enjoyed this app thoroughly until recently (Within the past two months). My app started to not load songs that come next in any playlist unless I have the app open and song on the screen. This has made my music experience with this app unbearable. If I hadn't already built large playlists with all of my favorite music, I would have stoped using this app."
"Soundcloud as a site is 5/5, their app barely deserves 2 stars. Crashes frequently, doesnt save your spot when you're listening to a playlist, pause button frequently gets stuck, refuses to close sometimes, the list of bugs goes on. You would think they could afford to fix the app, but as of now I would only use the app if you really have to."
"First we can't skip ads anymore, I can handle that I guess. But now you are following YouTube's bad decision two play two ads and making it even worse because we can't skip them?! I used to love this app, I would rather use it than Spotify because there were less ads. If you are going to make me listen to two ads at least let me be able to skip them after 10 seconds of listening or something. I don't want to listen to a 30 second long ad about the dangers of vaping if I don't even vape anyway."
"I love this app but they should add more songs from the actual person who made the song, but if you use this app for long enough they will but almost every song as a preview and you wont be able to listen to the song but for only 4 seconds. If you delete the app for 3 days then sign back into your acount the previews will go away. I hope this help some of you <3"
"Everything i guess is fine but what really really gets on my nerves is that if you have a lot of songs, you have to take forever scrolling down to a couple new songs that i found, and there isnt a button (newest to top) or (oldest added to bottom) this would be VERY helpful you know. This gets real annoying. I Hope soundcloud can make a little update just to make their app better."
"This used to be a great app, but now I get an advertisement every other song... literally! I switched to SoundCloud because it used less ads than Spotify but it appears that is no longer the case. Not to mention it pauses the advertisements when I try to return to the home page of my phone. Why?? Songs and podcasts continue to play when I do this, so why do advertisements stop playing? I'm trying to get back to my media asap, don't delay this by forcing me to deal with an ad for an extended time"
"Eh... Way too many ads. Especially for an app that doesn't legally own most of the songs posted on it. I would almost say it was worth it if every single song was confirmed to be good quality or titled correctly (which a lot of them aren't). Other than that, it's a meh app. Basically I find it to be a slightly worse version of Spotify. And this one doesn't promise 30 minute ad free periods soooo do with that into what you will."
"The app somehow has gotten worse with each update. There's some bugs that actually ruin this for me compared with previous versions. First, randomly playing a song even if you paused it, this has annoyed me when it goes off in public! Second, skipping songs randomly, even if you didn't make it do that, which happens when playing a song and going to another tab. Finally is the notification for the app not working, so I have to open the app to pause & skip. This is an ad riddled downgrade!"
"Not Playing Songs Past 3 seconds or less. Soundcloud has been having this issue for me for a while. I will try to play a song and it either won't start playing or it will play until 3 seconds, and then it won't play. If I'm lucky, it will get through a 30 second track, but only once. It sucks because during the entire pandemic I would basically play music from my soundcloud playlist all the time. I'd rather download the tracks with the online soundcloud downloader anyway, ads aren't worth it."
"every time i switch apps that don't even use my audio, SoundCloud cuts off my music and has been doing this for weeks. I've updated, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but it still does this and it's getting on my nerves. that or a song will play for 15-20 seconds before skipping to the next one. fix these bugs and ill fix my rating."
This is my go to app for music when im at work ... I pay 9.99 a month to listen to the music u can't listen to when u dont have a fee And also i don't like hearing commercials being that I work overnight.. The only issue i have is when i started paying the fee soundcloud keeps not responding..so it keeps cutting off and i have to keep taking my phone out to get it to play..i pay to hear the music monthly so im a little annoyed..other than that i have no other issue
"In the past years this site has been on a steady decline in quality and popularity. The only reason I currently use it is because it's quick and easy to upload 320 MP3 files while having it in a presentable fashion. However, innovation is needed because it is lacking in new ideas. It has been for awhile. I don't believe you should have limits on uploading. It is the defining negative. Competitors like Matter, Bandcamp or even YouTube have every feature you have but expanded upon. Lol."
"Was above decent, until the majority of tracks got put behind a paywall. A lot of the draw for soundcloud was that you could listen to more free tracks and actually play your playlists in order with a free account, unlike spotify. Also that you can not turn off autoplay is a huge pain when you're listening to music to go to sleep with."
On a pixel 2 and when I close the sound cloud app it just keeps playing. There is nothing in my notification bar saying the app is alive and/or playing active audio. Very strange behavior. I'm a couple updates behind so maybe it's something they fixed but im hesitant to update since it's a 1/2 a GB and they just push more ads everytime I do. SoundCloud itself has gotten better but the mobile app isn't great.
"For some reason when I reach the end of a playlist it doesn't loop the playlist and leaves it for a song on my recommended list. Also, the quick menu in my notification menu doesn't let me go to the next song and all I can do with it instead is like/unlike or pause. I didn't think this kind of glitch could happen since I have an S10. Speaking of glitches, recently certain tracks couldn't be played more frequently."
"Okay! I have had enough of these ads. I can handle maybe one or two after five or so songs but, you all take it WAY too far! Each time I am in the middle of listening to a song and go back into the app, it immediately stops my song and goes to an advertisment then skip to the next song! I know the songs weren't over when this happened because it doesn't say it on the time stamp! Almost about to delete this app!"
I used to really love this app. But lately its been crashing and making my whole phone glitch! I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it back but it's no use! What's more irritating is that it works on my computer but not my phone. As much as I love all my playlists on SoundCloud and hate Spotify I think I'm going to go there.
"My poor rating is for soundcloud go, the free version of the app works fine but I opted into soundcloud go before a 1200 mile roadtrip so I could listen to my content offline, however, I've never regretted a purchase more. I have around 2700 mixes and songs liked and downloaded them all, doing so slowed my phone to crawl during the downloading, which wasn't an issue considering the hefty demand. HOWEVER, soundcloud will randomly ""check offline content,"" with no warning or way to opt out. While the app does it, it slows my device until it is completely frozen and requires a soft reset to become usable again. It's done this on both my S7 edge, as well as my Note 9. I am a huge soundcloud supporter but am extremely disappointed with the paid version of this application."
"Alrighty, super old review update. Sad to do this. THE LIKED PLAYLIST AND LISTEN HISTORY LIST ARE BROKEN. I have old liked songs at the bottom and to put it at the top I unlike then like it but now IT GOES BACK ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM. History playlist doesn't even keep track anymore either. And STOP ADVERTISING SC GO ON YOUR OWN PLATFORM, It's pretty lazy to do that and irritating! Every ad I get. There's also no way to even contact you guys on issues like this, so I can only hope.. ._."
"Streams are constantly buffering no matter which internet connection I use. And streams wont auto rotate to landscape mode when I turn my phone sideways. I have to manually force it to rotate with the rotate button. Very annoying when switching between apps. Also, ads constantly interrupt streams as soon as I select one to watch, not allowing me to check if I even want to watch the stream in the first place, often times deterring me from watching any streams at all."
"Every time I try to watch the twitch app the streams keep buffering. It's very frustrating. When I'm on my phone watching twitch on the app, I get so angry with the buffering that I have to search Google to find the desktop version. On my phone, the desktop version works fine so it doesn't seem like it's a problem on my end. I hope this problem gets fixed so I can watch the twitch app again."
"Ever since the recent update I haven't been receiving alerts about when people I'm following go live. I don't know what's going on but this has never happened before. And when streamers do predictions, I have to close out of the stream and re-enter, which is annoying. Twitch has not been a problem for me using but of late this is ridiculous. This needs fixed"
"I will prefer the previous version over the new app update. On Android TV, the app keeps flickering when watching, laggy playback, quality is not remembered (keeps defaulting to Auto), and the user experience is not the same any more. All these issues were not there in the previous version and that makes it frustrating. I am forced to use third-party alternatives for now until these issues are fixed"
I use this app on a daily basis to watch my favorite streamers and moderate streams for others. It's hit or miss most days. It takes way too long to generate a clip and by the time it finishes the stream has already moved on past the moment by several minutes. Here lately the app has been absolutely horrible. The minute I try to click to watch a stream or even past broadcasts it freezes and crashes. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing. Hope next update brings a major fix for it.
"I can't edit my clips which is pretty much all I use the Twitch App for, to clip things and edit them. But the clips just buffer then freeze and never play so I can't even edit them how I want to and if I just back out completely to start over it just posts the unedited clip which means I need to go back later and delete it which makes this app pointless if it makes MORE work for me. Plus watching my stream in general is a nightmare when it CONSTANTLY buffers. Just about ready to uninstall."
The app is fine if you mostly watch streams and chat. There are still issues there. Sometimes chat or the stream stops. You basically close the app and open it up again as the quickest fix. Hype train and gifted pop ups don't clear from the chat area. Hype train timers often freeze. Clips don't work well as a viewer if the app does preload basic you can't watch it. But then nor does making one ever work well. Screen resize issue is back. Making clips is basically pointless.
"I like to watch from my NVidia Shield and chat via my laptop. This worked fine until the latest update. The new update on the Shield added such a huge delay (~10 sec) that it is no longer an interactive experience. This is not acceptable. Fix it. Also: Hitting the ""Back"" button while overlays are on screen should hide the overlays, not exit the stream."
"Hard to navigate to the channels you're subscribed to, takes several clicks and loading screens to get to their past broadcasts, and ads are abysmal. Also, a channel's past broadcasts are only kept for 30 days, so anything past that becomes lost media. Giving this two more stars than it deserves because it is legitimately a good platform for creators to use, and I watch twitch broadcasts a lot, but it does feel like a ball and chain..."
"New update to the Google TV app is buggy and annoying to use. Simple arrow nagivations pull you out of the current stream and push you back to a menu. It is way to easy to press the unfollow button on the stream itself, as well as accidentally pressing 'report stream'. Although the updated chat feature is welcome, the constant menu choices on a stream taking you out of it is highly unwelcome and makes the experience worse."
"Can twitch fix the raid feature? Haven't been able to join raids. It just ends. Been happening for a while and it's not just my account. When in the app, there's an annoying notification for the audio as if I'm watching on mobile browser or listening to the audio while in another app. It can't be removed unless I close the app, and it comes right back when I open it. They should honestly revert the app back to what it was before this most recent update. Why fix something when it's not broken?"
"Pretty awful app to be honest. No low-latency mode. No BTTV support. No customization. Very bare bones app, with plenty of bugs that come along with it. Edit: Still bad, maybe worse than it used to be. Channel bets barely work, it buffers constantly on gigabit internet, basically not worth using at all. None of my previous problems have been fixed either."
"Works okay unless I switch away from the app while casting to any device, like Chromecast or a smart TV. If I'm casting, Twitch drops the quality, no matter what I selected. And when I switch back to the app, it interrupts the stream for about 1.5 seconds. This is on Android 13, and it's a really terrible experience. I can't have the app on screen 100% of the time, but that seems to be what Twitch expects. Awful experience for watching DJs, which is my primary use."
"Whatever updates they did, they've made this current version inferior on chromecast w/ google tv, and tv w/ google tv. App is now more prone to random crashing (especially when loading ads, also an issue on my tablets), loading times are significantly slower now with what appears to be a deliberate delay when starting and exiting streams, and there is a lot of inconsistency when starting streams with it randomly either opening a stream directly or going to the channel page instead."
"I love Twitch, but the mobile version has so many problems, which isn't ideal, considering I prefer using my phone. One of my biggest issues is that in order to see predictions or other extentions, I have to completely close the stream and reopen it to refresh it. Often, this takes long enough that I'll completely miss out on being able to bet in the first place, and I miss anything that happened in the couple seconds the steam wasn't up."
"Thus app is bandwidth greedy. If it doesn't have a perfect bandwidth with no issues it will lag and never come back. When this happens you have to restart the app. Bandwidth usage compared to YouTube for instance, is about double. Where YouTube comes out on top because even if you don't have perfect bandwidth, it will at least keep trying and continue to play."
"Twitch provides you the quickest access to a celebrity of your choosing. But there are a lot of ads you have to watch under almost every stream you aren't subscribed to. You also do not have a history you can look back to. So if you somehow watch a stream and it isn't within the 5 last streams you've watched, it is back in the pool of millions of videos just for one broadcast. It's frustrating, since videos have a limit to a month (approximately) and after that it's deleted forever."
"Constantly laggy and endlessly buffering no matter what I do. Connected to internet, connected to data, hotspot, it doesn't matter. It's not like my wifi or data are bad, they aren't. I have a good connection for everything else using the same connections on my phone. Other live stream services I have no problem with, but this one I do and I don't know why. Don't think it was always like this, but it is now and it's annoying."
"Does anyone else have a weird issue where the audio is pitched down after an ad plays? It's a bit frustrating, especially with how often ads play. PIP has issues loading video, or refreshing and jamming more ads into my face. It's just not a consistent enough experience for me to really want to use this app. update: problems still persist on latest version. PIP seems a little more stable, but was definitely not my biggest complaint."
"It'd be nice if the majority of the time I tried to clip something I wasn't hit with ""Something went wrong!"" with no clue on how to try to go about fixing it or if it's even the same thing every time. Or, on the off chance that I'm actually able to get farther in the clip process, that I'm also able to properly adjust the clip before it gets posted. It's incredibly frustrating when nothing you've tried works (updating the app, resetting the device, logging in and out, etc) and no one has answers"
"I love Twitch. It's great for entertainment. But recently, it's been basically unusable for me. Nothing has changed with my internet (WiFi signal is strong, and I've tried swapping to LTE, yet almost every stream I've tried watching freezes up completely and never comes back. Chat continues fine, and if I close the stream and reopen, ads play perfectly fine, the stream loads for about 10 seconds, then freezes again."
"No Video display at 1080p output It's a shame that for several years, Twitch has been unable to fix the issue regarding black screens being shown for people who output 1080p on their mobile app. I'm not sure if it's been explicitly recommended to stream at 720p or not. However, this situation is very irritating. I love Twitch so much and I even stream on their platform. However, Twitch's refusal to address the situation has unfortunately led me to uninstall the app from my phone."
"How bad of a design can it be? Sure, it does it's job-streaming, but in everything else it lacks. You can't decide if you want it to keep playing after you close the screen or exit to homescreen. If you're on full screen mode you can't swipe to go back, it's only by pressing a button. You can't see how long the stream is going and a lot more design flaws that attracts all the hate towards this app. And we're not talking about adding 3rd part emotes."
"Okay, so the app is great. However, recently, I have been experiencing issues. Whenever I try to watch a stream, the screen would stay black. No visuals, no audio. Now, the chat works normally, and if I switch to audio only, I can hear the stream. But if I attempt to go back, the screen will go black again. I've tried reloading the app, uninstalling and reinstalling, and much more for 20 minutes and could not get it to work again. Thus is the reason for a 2 star review."
"Im unable to verify phone number on mobile (and the website doesn't even allow you to sign in and do it there). Therefore, I can't chat on streams that only allow verified accounts. When you click to enter password after entering number, the keyboard never pops up. It just auto closes, and you can't type anything at all. Then the app gets stuck in a loop, and you have to close it. Rather serious bug to have."
"S10 + now Note 10+ both have issues playing clips back. My note 9 has no issues. Im not sure why it does it and it doesn't do it for every steamer but I believe it either has something to do with the streamer recording at 1080p@60 or if it's a stream that's listed as, ""for mature audiences"" I think the app doesn't pop up the notification to view mature. Audio plays but no video on clips from certain people."
"Ive reinstalled the app 3 times, and it's fine for a few days, then I have to switch to the browse tab back to following if I even want to see who I follow is live. Clips don't even work half the time, and when they do, you can even skip around in it without the clip just ending and either going to the next clip, or having to restart it. App crash in the middle of a stream? Guess you have to watch yet another ad. Flipping through channels to find one you enjoy? Ad at the begining of every stream"
"Way too many ads when you're trying to watch. Also, I had to delete the app after only a day because of how many push notifications I received. I received 10 notifications for streams I didn't follow in under 8 minutes. That is far too many; there is no easy way to turn them off. Lags quite a bit while watching a stream. Overall incredibly inferior to the desktop site."
This app lately has been a bit of a dumpster fire. I swear there is a new issue every month. The latest include not being able to find clips on channels where there were no clips created in the last 24 hours and massive audio desync. The sort option to find most popular by week/month/all don't appear without a clip from the last 24 hours. All streams on mobile have an audio desync causing sounds to come through far after the video feed. I hope they fix this soon as I use the app very frequently.
"This app is in serious need of maintenance. The clip feature has so many issues, and very often the streamers screen even goes black while the audio continues. Twitch is the only thing I actually put money into and it's bad enough that they discontinued the desktop app. So with one thing out of the way, you'd expect them to pay more attention on what's still running, but apparently, that's not the case. This clip issue has been on for months while the black screen is fairly new."
"This app is just...not good. It not broken, but the user experience sucks. The ff/rw function doesn't follow industry standards of double-tapping for ff/rw, and the ""buttons"" are far too small. If the screen shuts off, the stream starts over at the beginning, unlike every other streaming service, which save progress. This is an issue with long streams like Critical Role. The latter is a problem across all Android platforms, including TV boxes, where such things are very important."
"It was great at first, but then sometimes it wasn't giving me notifications. And then in the middle of the stream it would say 'broadcast has ended' but the stream was actually still going. It does this several times every stream. I've tried closing and opening again. And force stopping it but nothing seems to work. Incredibly frustrating."
"Watching my own stream with another phone on the same version, and the past broadcasts on any android with this version of the app is very choppy, but review of the same footage on an apple twitch application or web browser, the footage is at a smooth 30 fps. Not sure if this is related, but i can watch twitch partnered streamers with no playback issues at all. I am not partnered, so I can only broadcast source quality, but it is downscaled enough to play easier."
"Some audio bugs seem to have been fixed, have no issues with the video aspect of streams everything is smooth in HD quality. I still dont understand why the ads on vods are so much louder than the stream, maybe 2 or 3 times the volume. If i have my volume at 40% it spikes to closer to 90% when an ad plays, makes it almost unbearable to listen with headphones on with most ads I have to quickly drop volume or jusy take my headphones off."
the menu navigation is a nightmare. would be better to simply have a subscription list ip front on the app like youtube instead of a continue watching. removing chat from fullscreen is not readily apparent and took me a lot of wasteful screwing around to discover. it would be nicer to have the settings actually encompass all settings in an easily usable format with surfing in just as easy of a way.
"Not good. Been using for a long time, kind of hoping they would fix some issues, but still the same annoying experience. You lose your place in VoD's on the regular, just by doing simple things like changing the quality of videos, and sometimes just flat out doesn't remember where you left off. Pop out player is absolute trash compared to other apps, always need to reload stream on pop out, causing you to get an immediate add, every single time you use it."
"The ads are out of control. When you load a stream and every time you change streams, you get ads. Then I get upwards of ten ads, each fifteen to sixty seconds long, every 30-60 minutes. On average it is around five minutes of ads per 30min. I get FAR fewer when watching via a browser. Some ads also have extremely high volume issues. Some functions just plain don't work. I've watched on Twitch since it's inception when it split from Justin.tv and the quality of service has gotten steadily worse."
"The app was great for years, until some recent updates which make live viewing a horrible experience for users. Who ever thought constantly causing the status bar to show in landscape view to remain showing until you tap the screen to get rid of it, should use the app more often. Depending on which device you are using, the status bar can cover anywhere for 1/4 to 1/3 of the screen. People who subscribe to watch their favorite streamers don't want to keep tapping the screen just to see them."
"The app is great as a platform over the browser version. All the features are there but there have been more and more consistent issues as of late and my experience has been ruined by it. Functions like clipping or timeline control stops half the time. Battery drain, even in background audio mode, is rediculous and adds tend to break the current time code while watching vods. Adds seem generic/ universal and have no catering to demographics. Im watching ttrpgs and get esports adds non-stop???"
"This app has been giving me a lot of issues lately. Delays and pitch changes after advertisements, forcing me to reload the stream, resulting in another advertisement that causes the same issues. Often times sound will keep playing after the app has been closed, and sometimes streams won't even load. All of these have been happening on multiple devices."
"If I wasn't epileptic, I'd watch twitch on my computer. But, unfortunately, I'm stuck to the small screen of my phone for long videos. The app has progressively gotten worse & worse. It's not an internet issue. I have to frequently back in & out in order to fix things like: -Live stream buffering. A single buffer will last over an hour. -The bar at the bottom when an ad plays doesn't go away. -Stream/VOD buffers and continues, but the screen is frozen. - Many others I can't fit here."
"The latest update has introduced a few new bugs that are particularly annoying. 1. Hitting the pause button and then unpausing a stream does not skip ahead to live feed, instead it resumes where you paused. The only way to get back to live feed is to select a different video quality. 2. When you first open a stream and get a 30 second preroll ad (for example), once the ad ends you now have 30 extra seconds of delay to the stream!"
"In terms of the quality it provides it's services, Twitch is alright. It isn't amazing, it isn't terrible. There is one thing that moves it below average though. Twitch makes it difficult to manage your subscriptions across platforms, seemingly arbitrarily. You can't unsubscribe on your phone for a subscription you made on a PC. It's a pretty simple thing to fix, I'm not sure why Twitch hasn't over the years it has been operating."
"Garbage. Casting works once in a blue moon. Video and sound are often out of sync. Ad volume is 3x louder than the stream. Minimizing the app stops the chat, so unless you leave it up for the entire stream, you will miss large portions of the conversation. 2 stars because it does play video most of the time."
"This app is good but lately it has been locking me into watching a stream. Like I will have a stream in full screen mode, but then when i turn it back around into having my phone vertical, I literally cannot exit the app or do anything but watch the stream and type in chat. Like I press my home button or the back button, nothing happens. I lock my phone, open it back up, and it still wont allow me to exit the stream or even put it back into full screen mode. I have to completely restart my phone to be able to get out of the app. I hope you guys fix this :("
"Good, but vital component located inconspicuously: Stream Scheduling. It's in the middle of the channel page under preferences in the dashboard menu. the scheduling options are nice, but calendar should be accessible on the main profile page; allowing for adding, editing, and removing for at least 30 days out. Streamers might not play the same game 'EVERY' certain day of the week. Editing on mobile is imperative. I know there are extensions available, but none of them interest me."
"Twitch has overall been an amazing streaming service app, whether that be for streaming my own gameplay or watching the gameplay of others. Recently however, I've had issues with ads stuttering and stopping completely, therefore making me not able to watch the stream as a result. I've cleared cache, as well as uninstall and reinstall, but to no avail."
"Please fix the app. I can't stream anymore (but I can watch other streamers). It would say Lost Connection after about a minute of streaming even though I have gigabit internet speeds. The game I'm streaming still runs fine and smoothly without any lag. When I try to reconnect, it would either give me an error or my screen will be frozen on the first frame with the sound still working. After about a minute, the stream will lose connection again."
"I don't know what was done in the last update but the app is worse. I'll go to a stream and even if it has 1k viewers, the chat won't show up until I tap it. If I go to one stream, leave it, and then go to another stream the app will be unresponsive until I force close it. Also, viewing a person's channel and then going back to their stream makes it unresponsive. Streams will also randomly go black but still have audio. These were not issues until I updated twitch yesterday."
"Twitch is an excellent notification app! Whenever my favorite streamer starts streaming, Twitch notifies me immediately! Then I'll use a superior web browser to view Twitch. Because Twitch has the worst streaming app ever. First of all, if I want a landscape view of the stream, I cant turn my phone in the direction I want, it will stay the same if I rotate my phone. Streaming quality is very poor, even using Wifi. Lots of buffering. However, their commercials load quickly and play in HD."
"This app used to be great until they took away the option to pick the playback quality of the stream. I use my phone t on cast streams 4+ hours a day. If my internet isn't working at 100%, then the stream buffers and stutters to the point that it's unwatchable! I learned about a year ago to tune in the quality to fix it, but NEVER leave it on auto. It always stutters on auto, but selecting even the best quality fixes it. Please fix so I can watch Twich again!"
"well, I can watch streams. usually. app glitches a ton. can't type in chat, can't use the mini player, and connection is bad. sucks that there isn't a better app to watch twitch on. update: connection is still bad. videos on every other app are fine, but this one has to reload and buffer every two minutes. I will say though that the mini player issue was not a twitch problem, it was my phone"
I use this app quite a bit while I'm at work and at home on wifi. No matter who I watch off wifi the lag and delay for streams makes it completely unwatchable. Another thing that irks me is when I want to go show someone one of my clips I can't because there is no feature that allows me to sort my clips. If I slide up and reload though you can see for just a millisecond a sort bar. So that's bugged and not working as well. Wifi streams do work fine but this app needs serious improvement.
"The on demand video player is exceptionality terrible. Finding any video is a chore. Scrolling miles and miles unendlessly until you find your vid. Chromecast optimization is non existent. Doesnt save your video progress while in Chromecast, no playback controls while the app is open, and any time I disconnect from Chromecast the player brings me back to 0. Super frustrating for watching 4 hr videos over multiple sittings. I can't speak for the streaming player so that may be better optimized."
"When I'm watching a stream in full screen on my Samsung galaxy S9 the bar with the steamer's title, name and logo keeps popping up and does not go away unless I tap on my screen. But then after a few minutes the bar reappears and I have to repeat this process every time which gets really frustrating. This app deserves 5 stars so I will change it once this gets fixed."
For some reason the app randomly refuses to function. I've contacted support in the past about an inssue on Android where I'd open the app...and nothing. I'm met with a blank screen. No amount of reinstalling fixed the issue until an update. Now it's happening again. This is a recent issue and I don't recall this being a thing until a few months ago.
"This app somehow manages to mess up or entirely omit the simplest and most essential features. For example, it's incredibly unreliable with showing a list of channels I follow. I go to my profile and click the 3 dots, but it only offers to show my subscriptions, of which I have none. Under the ""following"" tab on the home screen, it shows a list of all channels I follow ONLY when at least one channel is live, otherwise it shows nothing at all. I'd list other missing features, but I'm out of text."
"Used to work fine but after latest update, it will NOT STOP BUFFERING. Buffering happens every 3 seconds or it just freezes and I have to keep closing a stream and returning. Makes it to where I can only have a good viewing experience at home on PC. I'm never home. Anyone else having this problem. Almost no stream is viewable anymore."
"Love the app when it actually works. I really don't think it's just my internet that's causing all of these problems since plenty of other apps work just fine most of the time. It takes absolutely FOREVER to stop that spinning loading wheel and actually play the damn thing. It happens a million times in each stream, whether I'm listening live or playing it back later. Network errors out the WAZOO. Can I please just get an app that actually works???? Come on guys, get it together 😤"
"30 sec, unskippable ads every 5 or so minutes that cause audio desync afterwards with the only fix being to turn off the vid and rewatching it only to then get another 30 sec ad. Setting video quality to auto causes audio desync as well. Should've never updated because it atleast worked correctly with no desync and very few ads. Minor complaint: Move the channels I follow to the TOP of the app, not the bottom. Scrolling down to the bottom is a nuisance and I care nothing for 'Recommended'."
"This app should be 3 separate apps. One for streaming, one for viewers, and one for creator's dashboard. The new update is broken. Literally have to exit the app every 5 minutes in order to be able to type in a chat or scroll down a channel's ""about"" page. I uninstall then reinstall the app several times a day just in order to use the basic function of connecting to a chat room or being able to type. It's 2022 and there's still up to a 2 minute delay sometimes while watching streams... what?"
"For some weird reason it completely blacks out the screan for certain streamers, I can hear the audio still but can't see the screen, it shows the title but as soon as i click to watch it buffers amd goes dark, but then i go to a different one and all of a sudden it works. Anyone have any idea why?"
"After the latest UI update, performance has been abysmal. On multiple networks and on any stream quality size, with or without headphones paired, streams constantly buffer and cut out completely. I have been completely unable to run any stream higher than 480p on the app when my Chromecast on the same network can do the same steam at 900p. It's completely unacceptable and is especially detrimental to low-latency streams."
"It crashed my phone's system when I first downloaded it, then kept lagging like crazy and wouldn't let me adjust the volume because that was lagging. I rebooted my phone and got a bit of functionality out of it (hense the two stars instead of one), but my phone started losing battery super quickly even when I wasn't using the app. I was loosing a percent a minute at one point without the app open and it stopped when I uninstalled this app. Love the idea but it fiercely disagreed with my phone."
What the hell is going on with twitch. I look for a channel by typing the name exactly and the results are the most irrelevant channels you can display and place the channels you want at the vary bottom of the list. Next when I try to go back on a video by 10 seconds the video goes forward 6 minutes or if I have a video paused for 5 minutes and press play the entire video will start at the beginning and I lose where I am. Fix the damn app already twitch. The problems never change.
"Noticed an typo in the caption for one of my vids and there is literally no video editor function on the app. And If you use the mobile site, it just redirects you to the app. What on earth is the point of using this app as a creator if you can't even manage your content? If the app is the only way to access twitch on a mobile device, maybe make sure that all the functionality is actually there. Guess I have to power my pc back on just to fix this one simple problem, since the app clearly can't."
"Its been working fantastic until today, when the app broke down completely, asking for my favorites even though i had them picked like 2 years ago, and not showing me any live channel after picking them again. And when i uninstalled it to see if redownloading the app would fix it, it wouldn't let me download it again. I'll see if doing something else may fix this, but I felt sharing this was important."
"Over the past few updates performance has gotten worse and worse. I'm using an older phone, so I figured that may be the cause, but because I can watch perfectly fine through a mobile browser leads me to believe it isn't the case. When things started going poorly, live streams we're laggy and constantly froze, but vods were fine. As of the newest update both live and vod feeds lag, buffer a LOT and randomly skip ahead 10-20 seconds as if it's not receiving data properly. Completely unwatchable. Been on twitch since the days of jtv, but lately with the way things are going feels disappointing, especially with the whole ""1billion dollar ad revenue goal"" forcing an incredible amount of ads on the veiwerbase EVEN those with prime, turbo, etc. its really disgusting."
"Twitch works fine... unless you cast it onto a tv screen using chromecast. I've had so many problems using Twitch in that way, which is a shame because it's my preferred viewing method. From audio and visual freezing to app crashes, it's a litany of problems. Hopefully a new update can help them improve the watching experience because as it is right now, they're not making getting engaged with their content easy."
"Bugs all the way around. Casting playback is really frustrating and chat doesn't play on TV, still plays on phone, and only when the chat decides to stay connected as you're watching the TV. Chat disconnects often while casting and has to reconnect every 30 seconds. Playback will also just stop whenever it decides to. Lots of maintainence needed for how old this platform is now."
"Audio runs slightly slower than it should sometimes on Note 9. Restarting the app seems to fix it, but that usually means watching another ad. Also, returning to the app from the pop out player doesn't resume play at the correct point in the video. Short version? This app is a mess."
"Content creators are great, but the app is absolute garbage. I've never had a worse streaming app EVER. i would HEAVILY advise using a computer, or not using twitch at all. Personally, I'm using a computer only because of the great communities. My problems with it: 1. it lags SO MUCH no matter what you try. Wifi or mobile data, or both. 2. It is very difficult to navigate, and find information that is easily accessible ón computer 3. It is practically impossible to stream from mobile."
"Background audio and notifications are no longer working. Recently, I noticed the notification that contained the pause and close button for background audio no longer appears. Background audio would then turn off after ~30 seconds or when the screen turned off. Pop out player still works properly. When I noticed that issue, I realized I had been getting a maybe 2 going live notifications a day when I have many more enabled. The phone is Galaxy s21+. Reinstalling/resetting does not fix it."
"Twitch is a fantastic service; however, the mobile client is buggy as heck. In the most recent version I've had frequent crashes, clips glitching out and not playing, broken ads, desynced audio, and some home screen elements randomly vanish until I refresh. Twitch, please fix your app. It's becoming way too frustrating to use."
"I'm perfectly fine with getting ads, but when I get ads in the middle of rewatching a Twitch stream and then after it puts me back at the beginning of the video, I'm going to be a little peeved. Don't know if this is a bug or not, but it makes me mad, cause not only do I have to click to the part I was at, sometimes I don't know where I was at so i have to refind my place. Please fix."
"Live streaming is impossible on the app, and only this app out of all 120 applications on my device. Has been like this for years spanning 3 different phones I've owned. It's 2022, streaming isn't that hard especially if that's what you're designed for. You all really need to look into this fundamental issue and fix it. The app is COMPLETELY unusable on mobile data"
"The amount of ads you are forced to watch if you don't subscribe to a channel are ridiculous, aside from the ads that are run by a streamer. Twitch FORCES you to watch so many ads it's ridiculous. It didn't used to be this way but as of the last few months the number of ads are way too high. This is my only issue, otherwise great app."
"Upon updating to the most recent version of the app, I was surprised to see that the Following page now showed every single game that I was following instead of just the active ones like in previous versions of the app. I checked every page and setting that I could find to see if maybe I had missed something, but it would seem that somebody at Twitch decided ""wade through 50 inactive games to maybe find an active one"" was a much better design decision than ""easily find things to watch"". The old version of the app still works fine, but if a reverting to such an old version is the best ""update"", than something is very wrong with the new versions."
"The app as of late has become terrible performance wise. If you ever minimize it into the mini video player and do literally anything, the video player becomes uninteractable and memory intensive, and requires completely killing the app to remove it. Likewise, the app still constantly disconnects you from chat, requiring a full restart of the app to reconnect."
"Suddenly unable to tap usernames in chat to reply to a specific person or view info. It spins and then gives me an error message saying ""Network error, please try again later."" I typically use the mobile app to view Twitch streams and often have issues with connectivity. Also hate that things are more expensive to buy through the app vs using a computer. Mobile users shouldn't have to pay more for subscriptions and bits just because they use an app, if anything it should be cheaper!"
Its a good app when it is not trying to push a ad down your throat everytime you click on a video like a week ago you could shut turn the video off and on 2 times the ad would leave but now if you do not watch the ad it will kick you from the app. I do not want to watch a 1 minute add it is very irritating. What i am saying is youtube is much better at least there you can skip ads
"Clearly they putting advertising first over user experience. Any time I open a stream, it plays for a few seconds, then a full HD advertisement loads for a few seconds, then after the ad is done playing it has to load the stream again which can take a really long time. Incredibly frustrating especially when going from stream to stream lookong for something to watch"
A lot of audio stuttering when streaming. Most noticeable on live music channels. Been a problem for a good while now. All other apps work fine. Happens on wifi with perfect connection too. Also annoying that Twitch will not let you watch a channel for even a couple of seconds before commercials. You get no time to evaluate if the channel is worth watching.
"Great app over all, but the UI/UX designer made some really bad decisions there, for example: 1. In the ""filter and sort"" page, who on earth swap the ""submit"" and ""reset"" buttons locations? At the end on page should be always submit/apply buttons. 2. if you tap on a message in chat, why the ""unfollow"" and ""mention"" options so close in the menu, i unfollowed many by accident while i just wanted to mention them in chat. At least add a confirmation dialog or something."
"How can the developers of this app be so incompetent?? Every single yodate has, without exception, introduced a new issue, and there has never been a time where the app worked as intended. Just wow. I can watch a YouTube video on 1080p 2x speed no problem, but a Twitch stream on 480? Buffering and stuttering gallore. The Mars rover has a better connection than Twitch."
"There's so many problems with the Twitch app. Clipping something is easy, but then if you want to trim it, it's nearly impossible unless you patiently reload the thing a thousand times. The tchat is always disappearing, I'm not always able to claim the channel points. If you're using the pop-out feature all these bugs are happening at the same time, sometimes when coming back to the app the broadcasting itself will just disappear but the audio will stay. Announcement doesn't show up. It's bad."
"It worked (more or less) fine - Annnnnd then! - Last few updates came. I mean ( in my case) last two update made app less functional. Very less functional. Random image freezing and buffering problems. Need to ( almost non-stop ) pause, unpause and exit fullscreen. Can't wait for next update, to see what they will screw up. On possitive side, in browser works just fine."
While I don't have the worst issues with it when on mobile connected to the internet I have soon many issues when it comes to using my mobile data. I have unlimited data and some pretty decent loading and downloading speeds with it. I can watch live streams LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE with little to no issues whatsoever when using my data. But as soon as I have to use Twitch to watch a live stream I'm pretty much put SoL...
"The layout for this app is disappointing. You can not close viewer window without closing the entire app, filter options for language doesn't work. Basically, it's rather time consuming if you want to browse other streamers not followed."
Terrible design choices with Twitch apps. The Xbox one app and the mobile app now force you to watch with a delay. I'll never understand why these choices get made. They don't even have an option for low latency or a way to reload with a lower delay.
"Been a ""thing"" since my first download of this..but if you're scrolling thru the streams and you click one to watch, then hit back or swipe down to return to the stream list, SOMETIMES it'll bring you back to your place on the list and SOMETIMES it'll restart you at the TOP of the damn list of streams. I ALWAYS close the fuqing app when that happens. I'm not scrolling through all that again. Either devious ppl writing the code.. or dumb ones. Gave it 2 stars though for the streamers. Should be 1"
"There is quite literally always something wrong or not working. Ive had to uninstall and reinstall the app 4 times over the last week because its the only way to correct a bug in the chat. The fix lasts a day at most and then the problem is back. It never used to to this, then one day it refuses to work properly. Makes no sense, there was no update, what changed!?"
"I didn't use to have this many problems. Buts it's ridiculously laggy now for streams unless I put audio only mode on. Even then I catch it buffering sometimes. It'd all streams too not specific creators. I'm on wifi so it's not like I'm running slow data. The website on the computer is fine? So like why not the app?? For the amount of apps that allow me to stream live feeds, this isn't good that this is the only laggy app. And yes I've Uninstalled and reinstalled."
"There are some genuinely infuriating compromises with this app. Namely, no ability to change playback speed of VODs, no ability to review and catch up with a VOD for a livestream while it is currently airing (which YouTube allows), and a Byzantine approach to background audio play. They haven't updated its core features in forever and it shows. I use the desktop site of Twitch.tv on mobile instead of ever dealing with this busted app."
"The app is not up to modern srandards - stream stutters for no reason, due to turning the screen off, due to app being minimized, or app getting to pip mode. If you want to stream, just don't touch your phone once it gets going or you will anger the app and it will mess up the streaming. Then, rhe UI is not user friendly either, you're better off using the desktop twitch in a browser, then a dedicated app..."
"Too much lag with the audio of a video. The screen no longer stays open. My phone locks due to ""inactivity"" and I have to unlock it to continue to watch. Please fix."
"I can open the app but nothing appears on my following page and it took forever to refresh, my internet was fine, I even have to open youtube to make sure that nothing's wrong with my wifi, and I also tried to open it through website but that's not working either. what's wrong with twitch? I'm so upset that I can't watch anything :/"
"Too many ads. You click on a stream, immediate ad. You watch about a minute of content, more ads. If you decide that the stream isn't for you and go to another channel, another ad. It is unwatchable."
"I love watching Twitch. Talking with Streamers and chat members is the best. But, ads while watching Twitch Streams are the worst thing because they break up a conversation with a streamer and I'm pretty sure most of us aren't rich enough to sub to all our most watched Streamers one by one. Twitch doesn't seem to be well optimized for smart TVs. my Samsung smart TV keeps freezing/crashing while trying to watch Twitch on it. I could be watching a stream on my smart TV and it just freezes my TV."
"Twitch app is so buggy, everytime I'm watching a stream it start lagging and then the video feed is delayed from the sound and I have stable internet cause it works fine on my computer but twitch app needs to fix these bugs cause there's no point in downloading this if you can't even watch the streams in peace. Don't get me started with their long, consistent, unskippable ads unless you're subbed. Very annoying when you miss something on stream cause you got hit by long ads"
"While this is enough for basic editing as I would use for simple editing, the export feature does not allow you to save the files where you would want, it took me forever to finaly locate my photos. On top of that using the slide bars for edits do not immediately reflect the changes, making changes frustrating as I can not see the slight differences in my edits on the go. I personally would not reccomend this app for anyone, upgrade to a windows or mac before subscribing to adobe programs."
"I'm not sure what you've done with it recently, but editing raw files is like working with a jpeg. I can't edit more than 5 photos before it crashes. We need to be moving forward, not backwards. I'm using a flagship phone as well, so it's not device capability. There's also something wrong with the color wheels where, when adjusting the color, the dot isn't in the middle, rather ¾ the way to the top."
"The editing for photo's and videos is very easy. Great tool to use for it. Unfortunately, there isn't much for support options and I seem to have a glitch in my account where only partial downloads take place, duplicates don't exist, and I have a hard time getting certain photos either in or out of the Lightroom app. This has been a constant issue and I've had zero luck finding a resolution to my problems."
"Maybe this an Android limitation, but the fact that lightroom doesn't recognize my USB-C SD card reader makes the app basically worthless. I have to use a separate file transfer app to import the photos to my phones internal memory and then import to Lightroom. It's cumbersome and just doesn't provide the a work flow that works for me. Would love to be able to view, edit and, import directly from the SD. GalaxyFold4 Stock Android 13"
"Fantastic app, but so many features are not available on the mobile version that you can find on the desktop version. The reason? I can't think of one. For example, why can't I stitch multiple photos into a panorama on my phone? But that's just one of many examples. Its a nice app for editing on the fly, especially when traveling, but it is a throttled down version of the desktop app, for no reason."
"This app used to be phenomenal, now - eh. Everytime I try to continue my work flow from my computer I get an error message saying - Failed to load development version. I can't get my updates I complete on my computer on my phone and vice versa. It's absolutely frustrating to have to start over every time I try to work on the go. I've wiped cache, cleared data, uninstalled and reinstalled app. Same problem. No matter what I do."
"Used to love this app. Super easy to use but now I can't even get it to work right. I try to upload pictures and they show up as other pictures or don't show up at all. I tried clearing the cache, Uninstalling and reinstalling, and even adding photos to separate albums but nothing works. Really disappointed in how much this app has changed"
"I have used lightroom for a while now and all of a sudden the program has begun ""stopping"" before anything can be done. There are no updates available nor have I changed any settings that would affect the program. Disappointed since LR is a very user friendly program and I enjoyed using it but if I cant figure this out I will have to find a new program."
"Glitch City! This app constantly glitches. It LOSES all my edits, even though I'm constantly saving them throughout editing. If I close the app and come back, ALL my edits are gone and I have to start from the beginning all over again!! Countless hours of editing, just gone in the blink of an eye. This is the third time in less than a month!! FIX THIS, ADOBE."
"Presets are nice. The sliders don't move easily. I can't see Before/After for each adjustment, only the overall thing. SnapSeed allows masking for free, better UI, movable vignettes. Edit: Thanks for the reply, but I can't really do a screen recording because it will look completely normal. But the sliders don't track well with my thumb. They lag behind or don't move at all."
As of yesterday all my new content is gone!! I was asked to sign in to lightroom only a day after being on it completing a project. I know the sync and backup option is always uploading so I'm really confused on where my pictures are! I've lost over a year's worth of work at the hands up an update! I would like to know how I can go about retrieving the missing photos that were not processed to be backed up!
"This app is usually great, if not the best mobile photo editing app. But what happened to the export settings in the new update? It says ""Save to Device"" now instead of export and the settings are non-existent. I tried ""saving"" a picture and it was only 1.4mb, instead of the usual 8mb+ so I'm assuming the 100% quality feature isn't on, and that's stupid. That's not cool to remove export settings."
"The features of the app are very good. You can do a lot with this to edit photos professionally. In that way it is a great product. But it is almost useless for me because it freezes ""spins"" and won't allow me to edit. This happens nearly every time I try. I have to close the app and start again. Every few edits, same thing. And at least half the time I add photos the app simply crashes. Even after updating. What a shame. Would be a great app otherwise."
Amazing!. . . . . When it works. Frustrating to say the least. There isn't a photo editing app on your phone more robust and feature rich than Lightroom! The fact that I can use color wheels and curves to the same affect as desktop is amazing. BUT I can't get it to work for longer than 5 or 10 minutes. It becomes unresponsive and essentially useless. I don't know why but it won't be responsive again until I restart my phone.
"Worked amazingly until last week. It was my go to for all photo editing on my phone. Now it crashes every time I open it and is stalled out importing a mere 1 photo. Please fix SOON. I have submitted a dozen or so reports from crashing with no resolution and have tweaked my phone settings in an effort to resolve it. I have plenty of space on my phone, too. No reason for it to behave this way. Please. Fix. Soon."
"BEFORE the most recent update, LR was a great photo editing app, and I have learned a lot since I've started using it. As of recently, it has become very buggy, frequently crashes and freezes during editing and I will have to exit the app, close the app, and wait until I am able to go back in in order to start all over again with my editing. Time consuming process! I would definitely expect this type of performance from an app that was free not for one I pay a monthly fee!"
"The new tablet interface is terrible, more difficult to use, and slows down the editing process significantly. In landscape mode the editing menus extend over the photo, so you can't even see the full effect of what you're doing. It is also more inconvenient to access menus as the brush tools, because the tab is on the right side of the screen but controls are moved to the left? The old version was so much better and streamlined, no reason to change it"
"Have used this app for the past year and LOVED it, however lately there have been so many issues with it. Photos and presets won't load, just get a black screen or they will not transfer. Certain edits will not save. I've really enjoyed the app and paid for all the bells and whistles, but I think it may be time to look for a new mobile editing program."
"App is good, but not worth it. Overall I'm very disappointed with Adobe. I would have liked to just purchase the program, but like everyone they want to hook you with reoccurring fee/charges. They make it hard to find the place to cancel your subscription, not in lightroom at all. Then they charge you for canceling your subscription. This is ridiculous. I would find another program that treats its clients properly and I unfortunately will avoid purchasing any products from them in the future."
"I love and hate it. I love the functions on this app and that there is a free version. I think it is absolutely ridiculous that if you delete the app or update it, you lose all of your photos AND presets if you are not on a paid subscription. All of my time is completely wasted and all my presets and edits gone forever. I don't understand why an app that is so important to people's photography jobs would allow something like this to happen so easily. Please fix this issue Lightroom."
"For a mobile app, it's lacking in some basic features like tethering. If I'm out in the field, a laptop isn't always practical. Tethering to a phone or tablet would be very useful. Being able to export a catalog would also be great. And no, I do not want to use adobe's cloud service. Some projects I work on are sensitive and cannot be uploaded to a cloud service."
"9/13/18: The app was importing pictures just fine until the other day. Now it has been trying to import a single picture for 2 days and the app crashes whenever I open it. I cannot even get in to access my other photos, even after restarting my phone. 4/2/19: I gave Lightroom Mobile another try shortly after my review in September 2018, and it was working fine until last week, when it started crashing again. I'm disappointed because if I delete the app, I will lose many custom filters I built."
"Not worth the money and the headache. Photo editing is identical to what comes free with my phone and for video editing I can download a seperate app for free that gives me the similar options. Not worth paying $50/annually. Besides that, getting photos imported is easy but getting the edited photos synced up to your desired destination is just a pain in the you know what. Had to go through the download process multiple times since the app kept dropping files. Overall a very disappointing app."
"Okay first let me say that I love this app. The editing abilities are great, and there are many available features that are super effective for editing my photos. However, every time the app updates, every single one of my photos are removed, and all of my created presets are deleted. I don't know why this happens, and I've never been able to get them back. I still use the app, but now have to make sure to download my photos immediately after I edit them."
"This could be 5 stars but my one and only issue is a big issue.... I shouldn't have to sync my photos from desktop to mobile. If I open LR on anything it should automatically have my photos and presets.... because THEY WILL NOT SYNC. I've tried and tried and it never syncs my photos until MONTHS later. Ridiculous. I pay enough to use the service, I should be able to fully use it, be it on my computer or my desktop. I'm constantly on the go... It would be nice to be able to edit."
"This will be from the perspective of accepting where Adobe is going with this. And frankly, the workflow is almost what I want (just want local storage as my primary, not cloud). With that said, the Android App has seemingly become more buggy. I'm ok on my Pixel 2, but on the Pixelbook, there seems to be so many bugs. They did eventually fix the dialog box issues (turns out it was a ChromeOS issue). But it's still problematic on the Pixelbook. I have a lot of trouble syncing (on top of random crashing, though not all that frequent). But it seems clear there isn't any focus from Google and Adobe on the ChromeOS front."
"Love the app except for the fact that I do 100% of my editing on the computer, then use the phone app to upload to social media. THE PHONE APP DOES NOT SYNC WITH THE DESKTOP APP. There is no way to manually start a sync, so the only solution I have found is to uninstall and then re-install the phone app, which, to no surprise, is EXTREMELY frustrating."
Debating on switching to a different service for editing and backing up my pictures. I've already had once were a large amount of my albums were all messed up in pictures were put into a big generic album. Now again some of my pictures are being synced correctly and others are not. Try adding certain pictures manually and it says they're duplicates but they're not showing up at least in the order they are showing up on my phone. Cannot search them to find them either. Support options useless
"The app is amazing! Great for making beautiful edits and it's very easy to use as well. I recommend watching a tutorial because that helped me get a grasp of it. I dont like that the best features are for pro and some of the effects you can only get a few of because the others are all included with pro. I wish more was free. And for some reason after three days of use, nothing will load none of my photos or anything. I don't know why. I tried multiple things and nothing worked. Great overall!"
"It is making my adjustments too dark after I get done. Doesn't matter if I'm doing a selective or global adjustment on exposure, but the image the app shows a minute after is much darker than what I saw while I was making the adjustment. All of a sudden the image just darkens while I now working on a different adjustment. I can't get the exposure right because it's not showing me the final corrected image."
"This is bull. I installed the app and it was working beautifully for the first day. That's why I gave it the second star. But on the second day, I tried adding photos, and it would either keep loading, or it would close and reopen the app repeatedly so I couldn't choose any pictures. So I tried unistalling and reinstalling it, but it deleted all of my edited photos! All. Of. Them. So now I have no finished products after hours of work and a useless app. Thanks, Lightroom."
"Selective tools. (The main part of editing), Wont open. The sliders stay grayed out. It worked a month ago when I first got it. I have the yearly subscription. And i cant edit on mobile. Coloration works with the separate hues. But nothing else. contrast, clarity, etc... nothing. Im running on an LGg8 thin Q with plenty of storage. Please Help!!!"
"This used to be my go to app on my S9+, but since an update, my preview picture screen just shows blank rectangles, it takes forever to load a photo and then crashes unexpectedly when I try to scroll through full images to find the photo I'm looking to edit. Please fix as I'm a premium subscriber and don't want to continue to water money on something that doesn't give me even expected functionality."
"It's a great editor, but it's got a pretty irritating bug. I've found that if I import an image, then edit the image in another app (which I do because the healing tool is a premium feature in lightroom, but it's free in pixlr) when I try to import the edited one, no matter how hard I try, it will say it's successful, but opening the edited one will always show the original. It's incredibly irritating. Uninstalling and reinstalling fixes the issue, but I REALLY shouldn't NEED to reinstall it..."
"This app is generally fine, but I cannot get over the fact that the blue undo/redo popup appears RIGHT in the middle of the screen. This is a huge UX issue. It's very distracting during whole-photo edits and utterly infuriating during selective edits. You naturally position the selection you're trying to edit in the center of your screen, so it's impossible to quickly A/B a change because a blue popup appears right over what you're trying to see. It is awful. Figure something else out, Adobe."
"Lightroom worked really well in the past and I really liked it but recently I can't use it at all, no photos will load and I can't edit any of my photos. I've uninstalled it and re-downloaded it but I don't want to keep doing this because Everytime I do, I have to reupload all my photos to the app which takes way too long. If there's anybody that can help me with this issue I would rate it higher."
"Used to be great before the developers got greedy. Can't export your adjusted pictures to your own gallery on your phone unless you pay $5/month for the Premium mode. There's no benefits in paying other than that since I tried it for a month before canceling. There's some added filters, presets and layers with the subscription and the ability to save your own pictures to device instead of their own cloud. Definitely not worth paying for, used to be a handy app for pic tweaking but not anymore."
"Loved this app until recently and now my user presets won't work! I apply it the the image and the image stays the same. I have googled the problem and found nothing helpful. I have updated, uninstalled, and reinstalled the app and it did not fix the problem. The presets/filters that come with the app still work, just not the user presets. Someone from Lightroom help me fix it!!"
"Great app,....if you pay for it. BUT!!!! What I don't understand is why take away more features in the ""free"" version? I already don't want to pay a monthly subscription. (Another one🤦🏽‍♂️) Then when I go to edit a photo quickly. I find out all of the features are blocked and deemed ""premium"". I'm very disappointed to say the least."
The latest versions of the desktop Lightroom (Classic and CC) will not sync photos with this app. Only get sync errors. Reverting to previous versions magically brings all errors to an end. Was frustrated trying to sync 20 photos for 4 hours with no luck. Couldnt even see the sync errors until i went to the web browser version of lightroom. My photos said they were being synced but i couldnt find them.
"The edited photos and videos are great. I have not had issues with saving photos to my. However, the awesome editing i did to videos from Iguazu Falls do not save. The ""saved"" vid is just a bunch of lines, like an old TV screen is broken. The sound is fine. I can transfer an original back but edited is junk. Very annoyed."
Normally this is app is my absolute favorite editing app to use. For some reason yesterday it started to not let me upload any photos. It'll go through the process and say that the upload was complete but none of the pictures I upload are in any of the albums and the all photos album number never goes up. Can you please see what is wrong with it?
"It was once a great app. Never had a problem until recently. The app keeps rejecting my SD card even though it's up to date and will shutdown at the most inconvenient times. Takes forever to load up and 80% of the time it crashes. I've tried Uninstalling, restarting, hard restart, forced stop...... everything even clearing the cache and it doesn't work. Sad... Adobe used to be such a good app but now it sucks and is in the same tier as those third class apps."
"When I upload photo to Instagram, before publishing, all of the color is lost, the saturation is drastically degraded and I can't use the photos I spent time editing in the Lightroom app. Only when I place them into another photo app then save it does it keep it's original saturation. Not sure what is wrong with Lightroom when it comes to this. Please fix."
"Update 1/10/21 A year later this app is still a buggy mess that crashes all the time while editing pics. Lowering a star from original review. As good as this app is, it is rather useless with all stability issues. Very dissapointing for a paid app. Fix the stability issues already! ------------------------ Love the app features, but it crashes constantly. Pretty frustrating experience, especially for a monthly charge."
"Use to work pretty good with occasional crashing. Now, I cant even open an image without the app crashing. Uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared app cache, internet cache, etc all to no avail. Program on my computer works perfectly. The app however does not. For what its worth though, I rarely edit using the app anyway. It's just nice to be able to show people my images without having to haul around a laptop."
"From what I've learned online, LR for iphone has more functionality which really annoys me. I can't figure out a way to do long exposures whereas for iphone it is extremely easy. That's just one example I'm sure. Also custom presets changed without telling us which was frustrating. As an editing app it's pretty good, but I also have PS mobile as I've had an annual PS/LR subscription for years so tend to just use that. Don't always feel I get what I pay for. At least desktop is good."
"I hate it! The app makes it complicated and difficult to find your images. I have yet to find my camera photos. It has no option to just open something you gotta make a folder or library then find your images which I never found the ones I needed despite being right here. Too annoying and didn't even have what I needed which was to ""defog"" some images. Not a fan. Uninstalled it."
Crashing on my lg-v30. It's been a great app until recently. I usually upload my dslr camera photos to Lightroom so I can save them to my phone and edit them on snapseed on the fly. It used to work fine but the app stops working now... We're all paying at least $120/yr. This is not acceptable. It easily deserves 4-5 stars if this issue is resolved.
"Everything was fine until I transferred the app to a new phone, It deleted all my presets and all my photos from the app and all of my presets I saved from discover. All of the presets I created are gone as well. I even tried logging into 2 accounts and they are all missing. Where did they go? Why do I not have MY photos. Did Lightroom take them?? What are you using them for?? This is unfair and not right. It's not like I made a new account. It's the same account I used on my previous phone."
"Lightroom mobile used to run smoothly on my phone, it was my to go app, whenever I needed to edit some pic I used this app and loved it, but lately it's been very slow, I open the app and it takes forever to load the pictures, when I'm editing it crashes (even when I only adjust the exposure), and other many issues that this app started to get. I hope ya'll fix it soon 🙏🏽"
"I am having difficulty using the (contents-aware remove) option. Maybe I need to pay more and upgrade to the professional suite for everything to work as it should???? IDK. Buy when I use the app on my phone. It works better than on my computer, which is very frustrating. My phone's object removal is even way better than what Lightroom has. Also, lately, my photos have become super grainy, and this is for every photo. Also app response is slow after editing.. filter option is bad."
"The app stopped showing photos that were uploaded and processed, instead there were just gray squares. I re-logged in to my account and everything remained as before. After reinstalling, most of the photos simply disappeared, but for some time what was pulled up from the account was still displayed, then gray squares again and gives an error when opening photos. It is simply impossible to upload a new photo for processing, because the application gives an import error."
"I have purchased lightroom yearly subscription, but i am unable to use it.In mobile app,it shows subscription expired.Talked to both customer serive google play and adobe.. i asked google play customer service to cancel the subscription,so that i can purchase new one From google play side,it is cancelled.still in Adobe login and lightroom app, i am unable to purchase it again. Really fed up with responsiveness of Adobe."
"App keeps crashing before it can even make it to the second screen. Tried reinstalling and same thing. Please fix, I paid for Premium so definitely need this to work. I will change my review once fixed."
I am sick of this app & the desktop version freezing then crashing non-stop! I pay monthly for nothing but frustration. My desktop is capable of running the program flawlessly. I have been dealing with this for over a year now; Nothing ever changes!
It was working perfectly well from me until suddenly my pictures started showing failed to download development version when ever I click them. I even imported new pictures but after a few days it started showing the same thing.. I Lost all of my preset and edit please help me out.
I've been using Lightroom for a year now and everything's been good but since I changed my phone I've not been able to log in to the app and it's beginning to get annoying. I've deleted the app and reinstalled it twice but it's still having the same problem. Please you have to do something about this.
"An effective and decent app apart from a few infuriating aspects. 1. It *always* mixes up the order of photos at random when exporting 2. You can't choose where it exports to. 3. Despite telling it to use my SD card, it doesn't. 4. At one point, after not using the app for a little while, it wiped all of my save data within the app. No more folders from about the last 2 years. 5. The current review system is clunky and bad. Have to change back and forth between Edit and Review. Unpleasant to use"
"All of the sudden I can no longer export videos. I get an error that says ""video export fail"" everytime. I've tried to clear cache, and uninstall to no avail. Please fix!"
"Still buggy, still not able to delete footage from the app. Should work by now. No, to achieve this goal via the website is no option since you offer a delete function in the app. Dislike the online upload/ import workflow and community support model a lot, too. Unsubscribed and uninstalled."
"Was forced to update the app only to discover that multiple features I regularly used for the past couple years (masking, healing, etc) had been locked unless you bought a subscription. Disappointing to say the least but not surprising coming from Adobe."
"This app be messing up lately. You create your own presets and after a short while, they disappear, literally gone. Your photos in Lightroom don't show anymore. Please fix this"
Very glitchy. I pay to use this each month & they've now removed the font I use for watermark & all other fonts are just plain boring. Will be blocking from my bank & will find an alternative to use. Do not recommend
Too slow. Takes minutes to load the preset filters. Took minutes to sync and even download.
It is good for editing. but they make you pay money for a lot of stuff. like videos when it says it is for VIDEOS & pictures.
Can't load from Samsung expert raw in astrophotography mode DNG. Always error and can't upload. Even copy the files to pc and still can't use it. Why only the astrophotography mode having issues?
I've been having issues saving photos. It'll show up in my phone's gallery for like a second and then disappear.
"For God's sake please add payment options other than credit card for subscription. Like upi or google play or debit card or amazon pay, etc. This might increase your subscriber count and will be helpful for 99% Indians who don't own a credit card."
Correction of optical distortions is outdated 10 years ago. Canon now has RF lenses. And Sony is generally represented by one point. When you have already done something modern. Now artificial intelligence is being used. You know?
"It's good, but please update the numbers while adjusting it. It's so hastle like you need to guess what's number is on it and adjust it again because it got over 20 or less than 20. But I want it on 20."
"Hi, I Installed Lightroom app on my Samsung mobile. The Internet connection that I have on the mobile is from my tablet( shared internet/data via bluetooth tethering). I'm not able to open Lightroom on my mobile as I keep receiving error message saying that there is no internet connection. But I'm able to open any other app and access the shared internet on my mobile, so I assume the issue is from your part. How will I be able to open your app so?"
Ever sense the update my raw photos are imported from my Sony with no color but the B&W color setting is not enabled.
"I opted for a Lightroom Premium subscription only for the masking features available in that plan. But since the recent update some of the options in masking like 'select subject' and 'select sky' were removed!!! The app says that there is a minimum system requirement for those features to be enabled. I have checked and found out that I have all the specs needed in my devices and yet I don't see the fatures enabled. So professional of you Adobe, to lure people into paying money and give up later"
"It has been giving me problems for functions that have to do with cloud connection (subject detection, adaptive filters)"
"Love the editing power of the app. One HUGE PROBLEM. When you go to open a photo, the photo search is always out of order! Not in the order they were saved. Makes it very difficult to locate the photo I wasn't to edit."
"Great for ipad and computer, but phones version needs some tuning:(. Sliders, specially the one in the bottom, can't move easy:( Very hard to crop photos because photo goes all the way to corner of the screen, takes forever to use finger to catch frame. And as of new update, Lightroom on oppo find x5 pro is crashing instantly, can't even open it:( I reset app and phone and cleared caches, nothing helps. And: make saving photos more simple, I can't see photo in Tiff after I save it to device"
"I was able to use 'select subject' and 'select sky' feature in the previous version but since the recent update, it shows that those features are not available on my device. How do you explain that an update can actually remove a few features which existed before? Does that really make sense!!!!"
"Many hours of editing will just go in vain because the edited photo expires right away. Pls fix this. It worked just perfectly fine last year but what happend now? Everytime I open my edited photo,it always say ""failed to load development version"" the hours of editing just went to waste"
"I thought they only ditched my favorite camera, but it's more than that. The update UI is slow, it crashed not only the LR app, but other apps & my phone, and to that the camera feature doesn't save the photos you take"
"You have to pay for this app to access important features except brightness, cropping, contrast and color"
"Paired with the Photoshop App, it's great! It definitely lives up to its name, 'Light.' Overall, it is a great product."
"Cloud not syncing, app keeps shutting down, says there are bugs and to update after the owner fixes the problem. It used to be amazing. Now, not so much."
not the best. No free trail. would like money back as I am ready to Uninstall first day of use and download
Subject Mask Tool: On previous versions of this app it has been able to use the Sky and Subject Mask tools on Chromebook unfortunatly with the most recent update it no longer available. it would be better if the developers brought it back
This app showing some glitches whenever i try to add a picture it didnt appear in the interface...so fix it
got this app in my old fone but now i use a new fone and the problem is i can't sign in to my old account every time i try it says theres something wrong. im so anoyed with this problem
"It could be a perfect app, but it's not. It doesn't allow me to use premium features. ""Not allowed in your country"". I left my country several years ago. I haven't been there for a long time. I haven't seen my parents for two years. They haven't seen their granddaughter for two years. I do my job in Germany. I pay taxes here. I have enough problems in addition to such a kind of discrimination from Adobe."
When I try to share a photo from my gallery it says that it add to library but when I enter to the app I didn't see the photo why?????
Makes you pay to do the smallest edit possible which is stupid. I used it for many years without having them be this greedy.
"I've had this app for a while and was by far the best out there for editing on the go. BUT, since the last update it has gone terribly slow, the effects don't change with the slider anymore, you have to slide and wait a few seconds. It's gotten so slow I don't even edit sometimes and just wait to use the desktop version. Hopefully it can be sorted with another update, until then it's basically useless for me. I'm using a Galaxy S9+."
"Powerful editing tool, but recently find it somehow got glitched. There is suddenly the inability to export my finished work anywhere - seriously. I've tried multiple times to save to device and move to drive, and no matter how many times I tried, the app would just shut down. I have the current version so that's not the issue. I tried to contact support, and that just sends me on a never-ending loop of going back to FAQ pages, which don't address this issue. My work is now trapped, no help."
Exceptional until I couldn't import photos from my device into the app even though I have enough phone storage. Tried it with and without WiFi but to no avail. Re-installed it again. I'll change my review once I see how it goes. Edit: Still can't import photos after re-installing. I can only import once and the next time would fail. Tried it re-installing several times. I don't know if it's the app or my phone but I hope this gets fixed soon (for me atleast).
I switched from iOS to Android and thought I had installed an imposter app. It takes a long time to automatically import photos so you cant rely on it to edit or share or manage a photo you've just taken. it doesn't handle videos at all. it's so slow that photo edit sliders often take a few seconds to do anything. If you try and delete two photos in quick succession it throws up an error. Just a few examples of everyday niggles which makes my 25k lightroom photo collection feel very precarious.
"i've been using the app for well over a year and it is to me the best editing app there is, but today a strange thing happened. it allowed me to import and edit pictures and then proceeded to ""one image failed to import"" less than 3 hours later, this is utterly unacceptable and i hope you do something to fix it, because i can't restart the app knowing i have 80+ presets and a large amount of creative work to do . please do right by your faithful creatives . i use a Samsung A2 Core at the moment."
"This app has one of the worst duplicate auto-detection features I have ever experienced in my life, and it can't even be disabled! Trying to import photos from my camera roll ranging from a photo of the sky to a photo of a passing train. Yet this app detects all of them as duplicates. I literally cannot add them, even if I delete all other photos. And the fact this ""feature"" cannot be switched off is frankly mind-blowing. Adobe, fix this bloody app, I am tired of it."
"If you want to use your phone to check through your photos on the go, rather than your camera's built in LCD then look else where. This app is dog s**t if you don't have a constant internet connection and a massive cloud store subscription from Adobe. You can't edit photos until it's built a smart preview, and it won't build one if it thinks there's one it can download from the cloud, even if you've got no internet connection and the original file is on your mobile device. Save yourself some bother, get a bigger memory card and just wait until you get back to a computer."
"Even though I pay for premium, I have to uninstall and reinstall this stupid app at least 2 or 3 times a week because it won't load the gallery and fails to import new files. I've tried logging out and back in, I've tried resetting default settings, I've used lightroom assist and nothing. Then I have to redo all of my presets and import photos all over again because it all gets deleted even though I always have more than enough storage space. It used to be such a good app, though."
"I use this app to apply presets to my photos before posting them on my social media. I wish the preset option was near the beginning of the options scroll, as it is the only tool I use on Lightroom and for every edit I have to scroll across. That's a minor quibble though. My main gripe is that this app constantly crashes and performs a forced close, so an action which should take 15 secs usually takes 2 mins. When you are editing multiple photos that starts to add up pretty quickly!"
Its got a bug now and doesnt work .. guess it needs an update
"If you pause a show, it restarts by itself. It may start playing when you are on a phone call. Sound can come on during a phone call. You lose your place in the movie/show or finish that show and go on to play another and play them without your knowledge. It even plays when you have your screen block set. No sound, no picture. Data usage can skyrocket without your knowledge. Other apps slow because of it's data demand when you think it is paused. You must remember to shut it down, not pause."
"Fantastic, this even has ICP movies/documentaries. I hope they get the rest. They have the best selection of horror flicks. And it's all free. My only complaint is it has been buffering like crazy (rendering it almost unwatchable most of the time) for weeks now on everyone's phone in my area of South Carolina, but other apps like Netflix aren't. This is a new problem. Otherwise, A+."
"AUTOPLAY is Annoying - Please Make It Stop!!! I usually watch a show or two before bed, but fall asleep fairly soon & tubi will continue to play show after show, All. Night. Long. I never remember which episodes I've seen (AutoPlay is also Very Distracting & actually makes it take longer to find a show to watch). I appreciate being able to watch free shows, but do not want to hear news from a different state blasting as soon as I open the app."
"A barrage of ads, bad picture quality (no HD streams) and technical issues make this a deal breaker for me. They have quite a few good movies, but quite a bit of filler in the way of cheesy, poorly researched documentaries. My latest experience has been with the voices not syncing, which is very annoying. Yes, it is free, but you need to be willing to tolerate the downsides as well. I've used this service off and on for a couple of years, and think that the technical quality is getting worse"
Continuous Auto Play needs a Disable option! Can't enjoy credits without getting shoved another title. But most annoying is that it doesn't show how many days are left before the title is retired anymore. A list of movies Leaving Soon would be a great addition. Ads can be very repetitive to the point of exhaustion. Player buffers well and play smoothly most of the time.
"Overall the app works alright so far, sometimes, and as long as you don't have any ISP disruptions. Tubi offers a huge selection of something for everyone to watch, although it would be even better if the trailers could also be castable and with fewer commercial interruption points on movies. Have to do frequent uninstalls and reinstalls to use this app due to malfunction/ app irratic behavior. This is highly annoying and time consuming."
"Tubi has a lot of great content. There are commercials, which you can expect, but they're not obnoxious like with other apps. My main problem lies with the app itself. My wifi has an excellent signal, I don't have a ton of other apps clogging up my phone, but the Tubi app keeps buffering. Clearing the cache doesn't help. Using the app makes my phone run hot. It's a shame, really, because the content is excellent. Finally had to uninstall."
I figured out why I don't visit to be that often. Both commercials are horrendous four or five commercials at a time. That's why I mostly watch freevee how much better application for watching movies and other programs. I give this two stars because of the way the commercials are way too long and way too often. I will come back to tubi occasionally but that's about it.
The selection is great and the play back of the shows is very smooth however the app gets stuck when playing ads (after watching 1 or 2 ads) and the only way to get past it is to close the streaming and restart playing which starts the ads timer all over again. Seems like a cheap scam to get you to watch more ads and makes for an annoying process to have to stop and restart several times.
"I admit it's really good, the multiple choices between genres is great but it stopped working after a while. It showed a tab about how you can fix the app, although it tried giving you advice the advice just didn't work and believe me I attempted to update the app but it was recently updated so I'm stuck with a black screen and ""advice"" to help me."
"I can't believe that I have all these selections! For free! .. I was looking Everywhere for ""A Catch"" .. but I can't seem to find any. Great categories! Cult classics and Nostalgic programs.. Edit: Took away three stars.. WAY too many buffering problems.. even when my connection is excellent, it likes to buffer a LOT ..like, every 5 seconds during your program, while the ads play juust fine. @ Max, workin a few minutes before buffering & buffering & buffering & buffering🙄ugh. Uninstalled 👎🏻"
"Commercials cause frequent freezing and require restarts through movie .This ""needs to be fixed"" , as it's verry annoying to wait through additional commercial times when the app. freezes to get back to the movie... Tubi App. continually runs movies non stop from one to the next . The App. needs a stop point after each movie so it doesn't continually run up data , and busy the service unnecessarily ."
"Overall, not a bad streaming app. Unfortunately, the app gets stuck in ""ad"" loops which you can only get out of by advancing to a later point in the stream program. And, this happens over and over and over. Oh, ya, and over and over and I think you get the idea. I can't imagine the developers have actually used the app. This happens on 5 different smartphones and 4 different tablets ranging from android v 4 to v 8.1. Not good!"
"At first everything was great, streaming movies and TV shows without any problems. However, 2 months after everything being great, everything stopped being great! The movies and TV shows stopped streaming. Same Android phone, same phone provider, nothing on my end had changed. Instead of contacting Tubi, I simply uninstalled it, since there are so many other similar apps allowing the viewing of movies and TV shows."
"I love the free streaming service, and I don't even mind the commercials even though I usually can't stand advertisements. However, it's glitchy. I'll select one thing and it will play another. It will also switch movies right in the middle of whatever you're watching. I've uninstalled/reinstalled no change. Sometimes it will play the ad block twice, like it acts like it's going back to the film and then repeats the same ads just showed. TUBI FIX THIS YO! 😎"
"The horror movie selection and video quality are great. However, when casting, the movie stopped 6 times and just went to a blank screen during one movie and I had to try and find my place in the movie where it dropped at. I have many apps that I cast video to my Chromecast and bone of them do this. Please fix it and I'll be more than happy to rate 5 stars."
"I've only watched 2 movies on this app. The first time it ran without a hitch. The second time, I played the taking of Deborah Logan and it was like the record was skipping over and over again. Every few minutes, the movie would jump back a few seconds. It did this throughout the whole movie. I checked if this was a problem with the video file but it wasn't. There was some problem with the app that was making the video playback jumpy. Please fix this"
"So I just downloaded this a couple days ago. It's pretty decent. But like 70% of the time when there are commercials, it'll get half way through them and then the screen goes black and it just loads. It never stops loading. I have to go back out and click play again, it restarts the ads and they freeze again. I haven't gotten to finish anything I started because they are all stuck on commercials that freeze."
"Great movies huge selection, but the constant spinning and buffering can be disruptive. Overall, nice app to find free movies. Can't find this anywhere else. Thanks TubiTv! This was a great so but now it's constantly buffering and spinning and it's not my internet. I can get on Netflix with no issues. Fix the bug and I'll change my rating back. Thanks"
So I'll give it 2 stars since they have a wide option of films and shows. I have very decent internet connection and it's way faster when no one is home. Why is is that my show buffers/glitches every 5 seconds but the ads play at a normal speed. I deleted the app and downloaded again and it's the same thing. I dont know if y'all need to tweak up your app but it's irritating asf.
Update 4/2022...in the last several months the app began buffering or stuttering every 2 min or so. It's so sad because there's such a great selection of movies. I did get a lot of effort from Tubi to fix the problem but when none of their suggestions worked there was no more contact. Just silence. I guess I'm out of luck. Original review.... Love it. Wish there were fewer commercials but I'm enjoying the huge selection of movies!
"No way to choose am episode or get to movie/tv info from the ""continue watching"" list. Must use the search function which is SO annoying. Once you're done with the movie and it suggests next movies when you click on it it automatically plays you can't see the details or if there's a trailer to watch which is also SO annoying. There is no way to turn autoplay off. no way to Mark movies and shows as already watched. it does seem to have a pretty good selection and limited commercials."
"TV APP FREEZING & EXITING AUTOMATICALLY!! Tubi use to be my favorite TV app. Not sure what happened recently but I've noticed this issue for a couple of weeks now. I thought it was just a temporary thing but it has lasted quite a while. In the middle of watch a show it freezes up and then exit the entire app altogether. Also, when back in if you fast forward to the part where you left off it does not play... A) It either freezes up again or B) Exit the app. This is becoming beyond frustrating."
"Excellent! Don't mind the Ads at all *** Update: when chromecasting, it inundated with long ads during the break. It breaks the flow of the movie. Also, very disappointing that it loses the skip & rewind feature in chromecast mode. Overall great if you watch on your mobile app but not on TV. Tubi fix it (I hope its not patent related issue regarding skip feature)"
Love this app for tv watching however it has a couple issues. One is when the movie can be heard but the screen is black. The other is getting a message saying there is an error and to to try again. Sometimes we can go out and start over and it works but this time we gave up and went to a different streaming app. Please fix these issues and I will edit my review to 5 stars.
It was bad. I loved it in the beginning but its suddenly stopping every 10 seconds. I have deleted cache and data. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. My system is up to date. I turned my android off and back on. It still wont play movies. I thought this was best of all but Not anymore. Dont know what else to do. Getting ready to remove it and look for another. Can you fix this??????
"Nice app for watching lesser known movies. However, recently the movies are very jumpy, as in they jump backwards & repeat the prior 30 seconds you just watched. Last night that happened dozens of times over the course of the movie, which added at least 30 minutes to the length of the movie and made it almost unwatchable."
"Great service, terrible app. After each episode of a series I have to go back to the main page for the series and scroll over to the next episode. Except when it decides to go all the way back to the app home page. Then I have to find the series again, find the right season, and then the right episode. Also I have to turn closed captioning back on for each episode. But the Tubi service is worth it. I've found so many things I've been wanting to see and couldn't find anywhere else"
"Used to be a great app but Tubi started running ads while movies are playing. I understand ads provide income and I am fine with that except the ads are badly edited into the films. Watching Child 44, the ads started in the middle of dialogue before the actors had even finished the current sentence. At least when one watches movies on TV, the ads are placed so as not to disrupt the momentum of the scene. Cannot, in good conscience, recommend this app."
"Although I can find most of the movies on this app on Netflix and Hulu, I will admit there are some titles I can only find here onTuBi. However if you're looking for a pacific title, or a pacific movie, you have a better chance of finding on Netflix or Hulu. The video quality on the movies is good, however the audio quality is ok, but need some work. Overall the app itself is not bad, compair to Hulu and Netflix. However it needs a lot of work. A better category system and more movies would help"
"It could be better. I opened the app and a soccer was playing. I paused trying to locate something I like and it started playing automatically. I minimized it and it started playing again. Three minutes after I installed it, I deleted it. I am not sure how playing without my consent helps them with their bottom line, but I will look elsewhere."
"I was so excited about watching the A-team again so I found Tubi once again and downloaded it on my phone only to be very discouraged by it's performance. I couldn't find the A-team, so I figured I hadn't seen he Flintstones viva Rock vegas for ever and still can't. I am getting to watch 5-10 seconds of the movie and about 20 seconds of buffering. I am going to get rid of it but I just keep hoping they might resolve the problems that exist. I wouldn't waste my time downloading the app"
"Listen, I actually like your app and think it's great, BUT you guys keep running the same ad twice for every 15 minute interval while I'm trying to watch a movie. Yeah, I get that ads pay for your app so that we don't have to, but it seems like overkill. And the fact I have to watch the same 30 second ad twice before continuing the movie is appalling! I wouldn't mind watching it ONCE every 15 minutes, but TWICE?! This really taints my experience. Please fix this or you're losing support."
"I downloaded this app to watch one movie, being ""my name is bruce."" Every couple of minutes the app would cut back in the video a couple of seconds and replay the same part while keeping the timebar the same. Then, it would randomly jump back up to where the timebar is supposed to be which often made me miss some dialogue. It also kept progressing the timebar while an ad played, making me miss even more of the content. It's not even the ad that's pissing me off. It's the horrid timekeeping."
"There are sooooo many options to choose from, and all free. Adds are minimal and not distracting. Those are the only good things about this app. The adds aren't intrusive, but the buffering circle pauses your TV show every 5 seconds, and no for all of the 5 stars, my internet is fine. I counted and one episode of Green Acres holds 22 buffing circles, rather buy it off Amazon than have to sit through an episode like that! Do Not Get, unless you like buffing circles every 5 seconds!"
"There's no settings for changing the speed for playback options. I live in a rural area and need a app that I can adjust the speed playback. All the app does is constantly buffer. I've not been able to watch anything with the app. Guess I'm sticking with YouTube, because I have zero conflicts with buffering using their app. YouTube has the settings to change the playback options, so movies don't constantly buffer. Fix this and I will love your app!"
"If you're absolutely craving to watch a movie then maybe give this a shot. I just couldn't make it through a very good movie as halfway through the same repetitive ads come on which gets overly annoying. It sucks nowadays because the only real movie app to watch movies without any interruption was Terrarium TV but it's no longer here, it seems finding anything remotely close is a tall order. Uninstalled!"
This USED to be my favorite platform. Now it's just annoying. If you're going to have 30 minutes worth of ads during one movie or show then offer a subscription. I've watched maybe one movie in the last six months because of it. Even Peacock doesn't have 30 minutes worth of ads and also has the ability to watch a movie ad free if you watch 2 minutes of ads in the beginning.
"The ads are highly annoying, its unnecessary to have multiple pop up adds for a movie that's barely 2 hours long. The ads then buffer, also making the movie buffer after the ads finally end. The ads are completely ridiculous and repetitive, this should be fixed to make this app better. It may be free to use but I'd rather pay for Netflix or Hulu to avoid so many ""breaks"" during a movie."
"I've been using Tubi for a year or a little longer now, then I had to do the upgrade to continue using it now I can't skip or more accurately fast forward 10sec the ads. I truly enjoy Tubi but now I wish to downgrade from 5 star to 2/12 stars only for that reason, I liked having the choice of skipping the ads now I hit the fast forward 10sec and it flashes but will not work. It also will not work sometimes during a movie I'm watching until I pause it close out that screen and press play again."
So far its been good. But Everytime i go watch something it lags pretty bad. My internet connection is good. I deleted the app and reinstalled it. I cleared the data and cache on it. And i also restarted my phone a dozen times. It still lags bad. I dont know what to do at this point. Update: they updated the app a few times since my review and guess what. It still lags. How about instead of adding stupid features no one will use and fix the buffering and lagging issue!
Android app forgets where i left off and skips episodes. Content is MUCH better than it used to be but trying to watch is an exercise in frustration. It takes about a half dozen tries to get it to play the episode i want without skipping ahead. Can't get next episode to play automatically with any consistency. It just makes the whole experience really frustrating
Great app. I don't even mind the commercials. I have never gone back and changed a review before but I am irritated. Frequency of ads during a movie keep increasing (every 10 minutes last night.) To further add to the problem they are the same ads over and over again. I feel like I am being brainwashed. I can no longer recomend this app and will be posting this on Twitter.
"The content is great! Plenty of good selection that are totally free. However, casting isn't the best. Sometimes when I'm casting a movie, after a commercial, a brand new movie will start. Additionally, there is plenty of live TV content, but the app doesn't give me a way to cast live TV. Not sure why that is, but live TV casting would be a big plus."
"I can be full of bars and my Netflix rarely stops, seems to run just fine.This app on the other hand the other had stop to reload every couple seconds. There are some great movies on here which is why I put a couple Stars but if you don't want to spend eight hours of your time watching an hour and a half movie I would not recommend this app at this time. hopefully they fix whatever this issue is because it's super annoying and I would really appreciate enjoying this app."
I used to have tubi on my roku player so I thought I'd give it a try on my phone but NOPE!!! SO MANY ADDS!!! and the buffering is nonstop I cnt even get thru the beginning credits half the time. the picture quality isn't bad though when I can get it to rin longer then a few mins at a time. I like it on roku. It runs smooth and easy on TV... but on the phone I'll pass lol.
"Had Tubi app for two years with no problems. Then for the past few weeks it started to mess up. Everytime I try to see a movie I get a message to restart the app. Reinstalled and cleared the cache and it still gave the same message. I already have several installed apps, and Tubi is the only one that continues with this message. Don't know what's going on, but it seems it's time to say adios. Will uninstall. 😟🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨"
"I had to come back and edit my review because, as anyone who watches the app can tell, they decided to get greedy and add more ads...I did originally give 5 stars but now you only get two because of the ads. You still have many good movies but all of the ads interrupting the movies every few minutes makes it intolerable. Going to uninstall until you realize that was bad idea."
Was going to go with a straight 5 on this gem of an app but.... Im not impressed with the lag between video and audio. Its difficult to stay focused or interested in a show/movie when sound doesnt match whats on screen. I love the wide selection of shows and movies but the lag got to me bad. Other than that i love the app.
"Ads, ads, ads. There are 3-5 ad breaks with 3, 30 second non-skippable ads in a row with a show that's only 20 minutes long! With a movie you get probably 7 or 8 breaks with just as many ads. If there weren't so many this would probably be a great app, but they are super disruptive. If you watch a 20 minute show you're probably gonna have to sit through 8 minutes of ads or more. Even with YouTube, you get way less."
"Such a great selection of tv shows and movies old and new. Even ""B list"" type movies. Its easy to use. All for free. I dont even mind the occasional commercial interruptions. Except for the constant stupid Facebook propaganda commercial pushing for government regulations on the internet EVERY single commercial break! Minus 2 or 3 stars for pushing agendas."
"Freezes 20 times per movie, plus a zillion ads. Also, it downloaded an ""app package"" to my phone while I was watching a movie on it, but when I clicked on it to see what it was, it gave a message that the package wasn't assigned to the app...I don't like apps that download stuff secretly in the background while I am watching a movie. Makes the app very suspect of malware or worse. Uninstalled."
"Its a decent app on the phone. No problems with constant buffering and loading. However, i recently installed it on my ps4 and it sucks. I have great high speed wifi and it buffers constantly. I want to be able to watch movies on my tv and i cant because it constantly shows loading screen over and over again. This app is best for mobile and not your console for tv."
"Great tv shows old and new, and an alright movie selection could have movies like halloween, friday the 13th, nightmare on elm street, broken arrow, mission impossible, ect. And sometimes takes a long time to load on my android that has a very unlimited and high definition, as well as high gb data internet even works sloppy on fast 25ghz high speed wifi! Needs to fix these issues and update movie libraries! Thank you if you choose to do something about these selections and issues!"
I love this app overall great experience watching my shows. My only issue is i just wish it was even more easier for some functions like casting from your phone on to the tv. Another issue is that sometimes it does lag alot and crash and another issue or thing is i always get an error code on either my phone or tv where it crashes so much. If the app developers could update and fix these small issues I would really appreciate it. But Thank you for making this app I am enjoying every second.
"The app spends more time buffering than playing videos. It stalls out while buffering and you have to back the video up to get it to begin playing again. If this was fixed it would receive a much higher rating, as the amount and variety of videos available is excellent. But as it is now it is all but unwatchable...."
"The app is slow and crashes a lot. But it does the same thing on my smart tv as well. So I truly think it's just a design flaw in the app. Great choices of things to watch, but it rarely allows me to because of the crashing. I'll stick to Netflix, Hulu, Paramount, etc. I do pay for those, but they work."
The variety of movies are pretty good. Lots of old movies. The only problem is that the commercials are the exact same ones over and over and over again. And you can't cast cast to your TV. Except for that I don't have any issues. Update: in the last couple of days I've had some serious issues with this app. Now I get no picture on the entire app and I can't even see a movie so I just uninstalled it. What a crock and what a piece of junk most apps are.
Would give it a higher rating but i don't think that it will ever change. 1st of all happy to see that Tubi TV is free. 2nd You can't change the language in any movie or TV show really disappointed. 3rd In the advertisements about Tubi on Facebook and other places it says no adds but yet While watching a movie and a few TV shows I've encountered a few ads. Sad to say but it's False advertisement. Last but not least very Disappointed because Because They don't have new movies or TV shows.
"Used to really enjoy this app, had a lot of shows on here that I liked to watch. Deleted it because in the mid of my shows, the app would go black and then exit me out of the app after a month or so of using it. Had enough when it froze my phone screen for an hour during watching one of the movies on there. Untill the issue is fixed, I'm not downloading it again nor do I reccomend it to others."
"The app keeps freezing and movies,tv shows keep buffering and the app will just stop playing and acted like I was never watching anything,other than that it's good.As a suggestion I wouldn't mind if the app had a autoplay button or switch for tv series so instead of clicking play on every episode in every season. Some movies and TV shows have a low volume besides that it is a good app. Some of the movies are dark and same with TV shows."
"You now have lost 2 stars. Its really irritating when you watch a series, then out of nowhere get kicked back 2 episodes, and have to ff to get back to where you were. Nothing was touched, just randomly, in the middle of an episode, it goes back 2. It happens about 5x a day, at least. Yes, I keep updated and the like. Id also apprrciate it if you could include bluetooth remote capabilities, as yours is the only streaming app I use that doesnt react to my controls... FIX IT. NOW."
"I was so excited about the selection you offer but so far it has been terrible, terrible lagging or buffering issues and lots of error codes. We get frustrated and turn it off. We have only had it 2 days so it can't need to be updated or a full cache. It does seem to work on my phone a tiny bit better than on the Xbox, though it is not connecting my list and history from my phone to the Xbox, even when signed in. Netflix, Disney, and YouTube all work on my internet so..."
"~It works quite well, when it isn't freezing/ buffering, it's even worse when it's during a commercial break... While it does take up a bit more data, I'd still recommend it... but for the intermittent ""pauses."" Fix it and you will get 4 stars and recommended. 4 because of higher data usage."
Very glitchy doesn't seem to want to play movies correctly and keeps fast forwarding the movies by itself. I'm getting fed up with the glitches and bugs. Please fix it immediately. Thanks for your time and consideration. Other than that the picture is great.
"Had given 4 stars, then 3 stars and it seems the developers are working so hard to get to 1 star. The app works well however user experience is horrible. Initially had minimal (2) ads within moderately spaced out breaks and you would enjoy whatever your watching now the ads are more and breaks are random. Also it will switch to a different movie after an ad break. Would love to watch content only from my watch list. Has too many indie content that are mostly boring."
"App used to be awesome but as of late I can't watch anything without it buffering every 2 minutes. But lo and behold, ads play perfectly at high quality without ever buffering! And it's not my service because I have full bars yet the movies still have to load every couple of minutes and almost makes the app useless!"
I love this app I use it with my Chromecast. It worked flawlessly but recently it stops every 20 seconds or so to buffer then it plays and then it does it continuously throughout the rest of the movie. Nothing has changed with my internet. Nothing has changed with my phone. Please let me know what I can do to fix this.
"This is great app with one issue. I watched a good amount of shows, but now it buffering every 2 minutes. I haven't gotten to finish the series because it buffers so much including the ads. (which I don't mind them, I watch regular tv and this app has less) If you can solve this issue then I would give 5 stars."
You'd think something like this app would have a much larger collection or at least a better quality of selection. None of the movies on this app plays at all not a single one of them. Only TV shows actually play as they should. The app is near terrible other than having a selection of classic and favorite cartoons the app is a total bummer that needs a lot of reworking and bug testing.
"Great selection of movies and tv shows. Difficult to watch them since I spend most of my time waiting for them to buffer through out the show. I tried to figure out a solution by going to the in app help center. Clicked this, toggled that, nothing : ( I'm sorry I just don't have the time...."
"The app is a great idea with the classics.Hopefully they will consider some more 90s classics.I love that it's free.The con is that there is alot of freezing and buffering,and I hate that.I also don't like that the video will cut off if my phone is black. Update:Still no change on the buffering,and its getting annoying.Also don't like commercials come on in the good parts of movie.Also hard to play from my phone without the app completely shutting off after few episodes of a show"
"Would be a great app, if it didn't buffer every other minute when not connected to wifi, even when you have good service signal, it continues to buffer every few minutes, if not seconds. When you spend 30mins, and only get to watch maybe 5minutes of interrupted content, it's not worth it. Even the ad breaks do this."
"TV shows and movies are old, outdated (silent movies), selections suck for the most part. For me I like faith based shows. The same movies are under every category, really??? You can't search for any titles to see when they may be available (if ever) or make recommendations. You send messages about your selections better than Netflix, you don't Even come close. Update your selections, open a suggestion tab, something to bring your shows more in line with what people want to watch."
"Tubi looks good, however it is lacking in certain areas it appears to have no language functions, if it does it wasn't obvious enough to find, tubi has movies and TV shows but many are not interesting or particularly well known making them unappealing for someone who wants to watch something specific. Not to mention that the searching is rather odd, I noticed that when I searched something it gave me the movie or tv show if they had ot but otherwise it was completely unrelated content."
I do not understand the reviewers on here who claim there are few or no commercials. Maybe they're watching on something besides their television? I find the catalog of movies and programming to be amazing. As much as I would love to spend more time with to be I can't stand all the commercials. I watched a movie last night it started out with five commercials every half hour and by the end of the movie 90 minutes later they were taking commercial breaks every 8 minutes. Way too much for me.
"Good service, terrible app. If you scroll past your local news channel while trying to reach your Continue Watching list, the news will begin playing on your phone's screen. Sometimes when you try to broadcast from your phone to TV, the show will start playing on phone when first ad plays, have to reboot phone to stop it. Fix the damned app. 4 stars down to 2, now."
"Good except thar content doesnt give more options of movies to watch . In a week or two i've seen all content of interest , movies and content 30% or better never change,and catergories seem ro carry same options of movies in each catergory Making it seem more choices available but not so. But best app i've found tp date"
"Disappointing that because I live in Mexico if I want to use this app I can only watch things dubbed in Spanish, that is unacceptable. I can understand seeing a Spanish created movie in Spanish but dubbing should not be a thing, the only time it works is in animated movies, anywhere else it kills the immersion. (Edit) gave it another star, I can use a free VPN app, reload the app and get the content in the correct language. Still think language of origin should be a a default"
"Great service but the app is obviously subject to issues on various devices. I have 2 Pixels with current OS, Tubi works on one not the other. Always says ""That didn't work"" and doesn't make any connection to the service. Reinstall didn't help. Anyone?"
"It's a great app to watch movies but every time I find a show I like it always leaves the next day, stop removing shows to add other shows that are actually terrible. I want to watch twilight I haven't been able to watch it in 2 years"
I like the movies they have to watch but I don't like how much it buffers. Its also the only app that will not come in portrait it will rotate every direction but portrait and I cannot see the movie details.
I had the most worse experience after I had updated Tubi. My app will no longer play movies .There is also error messages to keep restarting the app and try again to view the movie . Unfortunately there was no luck. I tried to uninstall and reinstall but nothing changed. I have a Alcatel joy tab 2. Can you tell me how to fix this problem ?
"TOO MANY ADS. I'm getting an ad break around every 5 minutes, not every 15 minutes like Tubi falsely claims. It's just getting worse and worse to the point I feel violated and exploited. They are selling your information. It's a long and futile effort to try and opt out of the tracking and targeting."
"The reason y Im giving yalls app 2 stars, is that I love all the movie recommendations yall give us, the only ⬇️side 2 yalls app however, is that while in the middle of a movie I was ⏰ing, yalls app automatically ✂️ off the 🎥 I was watching, & then a issue pops ⬆️ on the screen saying, ""were 🙍, were having trouble playing this protected content, please restart your 📱, that way the app will 🏃 much smoother"", seriously, whats ⬆️ with yalls app today, either fix yalls bug, or risk losing me😡"
"The guide glitches and is sometimes inaccurate, some of the ads are annoying when you have to watch the same add all day long a little variety would be nice."
"One of the best ""free"" TV apps out there. I would rate it much higher but i am not a fan of the way they inject ads and I really really really hate all the tracking. If you need an eye opener just install the duckduckgo browser and enable app tracking blocker."
"To echo Kyle Ellis' review, yo Fox/Tubi! Next update try and figure a solution for your issue with ad play whilst app is in PIP mode, huh? It's annoying and stupid as stated in Kyle Ellis' three star rated review having to constantly every 5 or so minutes into the start of program playing in the background during multitasking. Having to maximize the screen to watch 1 to 3, 15-30 sec ad break(s) IS a bit preposterous. Please come up with a solid fix on the issue, it's been 9 years already! Edit:"
About to delete the app but wanted to mention the MOUNTAIN of ads with everything you watch. Had movies with 8 to 10 ads in the first 5 minutes. Tubi has more ads than all 3 major TV networks combined. Selection is so so. Not worth the space on my phone.
"Only a 2 for good selection of movies , pop up turn data off should be able to turn that off. Tubi should keep track of what movies you've watched so you don't keep getting notifications for movies you've already seen. Pop up notifications during movies sux."
"OMG, what happened to all the movies that I had in my list and my likes. They are all gone. If it saved all the movies in my list without them being taken out, then it would be a 5 ⭐. Update: I uninstall this app awhile ago (can't remember when). I'm going to try again and hopefully it still has my favorites and my list. Update: what happened to sailor moon, it was on my list and one of my favorites."
"Tubi, what's going on? I can watch a movie via Google Cast, when out of nowhere ads (audio only) would start playing on my phone, and I can't stop it. I'm ok with ads to play during a movie on tv but not like that."
"Ever since the last update cannot access on my phone. It opens and gives error message. Have Uninstalled and reinstalled, clear cache, everything. Not great."
"I give it 2 stars because of the ads, love the movie selections, I would give it 5 stars easily if they offered ad free, I would be quick to pay for it, if I could have ad free movie experience."
ITS HORRIBLE..... Not good so it doesn't even have good movies I mean it doesn't even have that much movies I WANTED TO WATCH DANCE MOMS it's not there also I like the way they put all the movies that's the only good thing about it also I was watching everyone hates Chris oh a couple days LATER ITS DELETED!!!! WHY I DO NOT SUGGEST
The app doesn't run on my Android 12 smart phone. The search and navigation doesn't work properly. The good news is that Tubi works just fine in the Chrome browser. I rate the Tubi service five stars all the way!
Most of my favorite shows are here and several I have yet to see and all at absolutely no cost. Thank you for all these choices and at no cost so grateful today I was saddened to find out my favorite go to shows Bewitched and I Dream of Jennie are going off being in my 60's and unable to work I have had this app for several years and have absolutely no issues love watching on my phone and my (big screen) kindle PLEASE keep at least one of these funny programs on i would be greatful
"Tubi needs to update. I have a difficult time getting it to come up. Three technicians have told me that if Tubi does not update, it becomes difficult to get it to come up on the TV device, which is pretty new. This has become frustrating!"
Great shows but controls are not great. If you have watched a show already it keeps starting at the end. This needs fixed for a better app.
Tubi has a couple of good shows but the ads are annoying af there really isn't that worthy to download it. I recommend Netflix for more Excellent shows
"The app stinks. Epix itself is great but the app is embarrassing. It does a poor job of keeping track of where you are. This creates problems of rewinding or advancing. There are also issues of the playback getting choppy to a point that requires restarting what you're watching to get it back on track. For a video app this is busch league stuff. If the series weren't worth it, I'd have given it up long ago. Please get your act together"
For some reason they took off the genre tab. You have to use the search function to search for a genre. It's basically the same movie library as paramount+. It can't track where you left off watching or rewind/ff without freezing. Original programming isnt worth the price. I canceled my subscription today. Definitely not going back.
"Honestly, I don't think this app will deserve a two-star rating in the near future, but as it stands this is a streaming app in the works and has a ways to go. Right now it has some really good movies and shows, but being a newer streaming service its selection is really limited and the app is a little buggy and not as refined yet as competing streaming services. But again, it's a streaming service that's still in the works and has plenty of time to get better."
"App is broken and needs work. 1. Every time I resume anything, it does not run smoothly and stutters heavily. Only way to run it smoothly is to select 'start from beginning' and fast forward to where you were at. I'm not paying 5.99 to do this every time I resume watching anything. 2. Reverse and forward functions are not working accurately. You press back arrow and it jumps 20mins back 3. Playback is broken. It struggles to start playing media and stays stuck on black screen"
"Worst App Ever. (Sony Smart TV) Every time we paused a show, we had to back all the way out, come back in, resume. Then, it stopped working altogether. Had to uninstall app, reinstall it, then do the ""run to the computer, log in, enter the six digit code"" dance. I'll also say that the selection, many which are duplicated on Hulu, Netflix, and Disney+, isn't worth the price. Didn't even finish the free trial. We're done with it."
"It's ok, except search options are a nightmare. You have to search through, basically the entire collection, there's no filter for searching and there's no search option, period. You watch an ad, if you want to rewind back your program, even just a second over that ad you just watched, you'll have to watch it all over again. Overall, not enough interesting content to make me want to pay money for the product."
"I downloaded this app today I've been watching it for about an hour and a half and it has frozen at least 9 times. The movie isn't even over.. I have the highest data plan (1tb) My cable company provides, so I know for a fact it's not that. The app has tok many glitches!! If it wasn't for that I would say it was a pretty cool app!! But I cant deal with the freezing images!!"
"So, there are so many saying you will be charged of you have the dominos free 30 day trial. I contacted support and they told me that if you get a trial through dominos, you did not have to subscribe therefore you will not be charged. On a negative note, the shows and movies on this app are on hulu. To end on a positive note, customer support was quick to respond. Keeping the trial for the full 30 days now. Thanks!!"
"Works fine on my phone and tablet but on my chromebook there's some sort of error that puts a yellow shade on half the screen, like you're selecting fast-forwarding, but there's no way to click on the screen to make it go away. So on your chromebook, half your screen is permanently shaded in yellow. You can even use the arrow keys to change which side of the screen you want the yellow shade, but the esc key and any other keys will not remove it."
"I paused war of the world's to leave this review. 2 stars because 1) You can't stream on your computer ""soon you'll be able to stream on your computer, until then enjoy the app"". 2) Constant ""LOST CONNECTION"". If you deviate from the app in any manner, whether it be responding to a text, checking the time, anything, you'll get ""LOST CONNECTION"", and you'll have to reopen the app, usually twice. CONSTANTLY. And no, its not my connection. I know how to keep a stable wifi signal."
"it sucks, one reason is if you have to stop watching something, or if someone calls while your watching something, then it will restart whatever your watching, it won't let you resume from where you left off. that's a big problem that should not exist if your this kind of app, how do you have a finished product to put out on the market for people to buy when you have this annoying feature. hbo lets you resume just perfectly and other apps do also, I won't be subscribing after my free trial."
"I actually installed this app on my Channel Master which outputs directly to my TV. I have several streaming apps installed, including Pluto TV, Tubi, and YouTube. The EPIX NOW app was maddening to try to watch. It hangs up every few seconds interrupting whatever you are watching. It's like trying to listen to an old record that skips every few seconds. PlutoTV, YouTube, and Tubi do not have this problem so I have to conclude that the problem is with EPIX's server, app or streaming algorithm."
Very Poor Experience. Extremely glitchy. I have the new Chromecast w/ GoogleTV. I had Epix on Prime but recognized that Epix NOW had more content on it's own than the plan included with Prime; unfortunately most of the time I am unavailable to see any of the content. Each time I chose something to watch I am able to hear the sound but don't see any picture. It worked the first time I played a episode and not since. It works occasionally.
Doesn't save login information. Have to reactivate every single time I use it. Tried using activate from web (using code from tv) and using email/password. Neither one is saved. None of my other streaming apps has this issue. Old Epix app did not require constant re-activate/signon. Very annoying
"Can only seem to run the program from the app on my phone, not with the TV remote. Once an episode finishes, it does not automatically play the next. There are also very limited shows to see. Will probably delete after the free 7 day period."
"I usually don't write reviews but I felt inclined to do so this time. I consider myself an avid streamer having I think every available streaming service except for the smaller insignificant ones. Instead of being able to give them 5 stars, I felt inclined to put a 2 star rating due to the fact they have no skip intro options on their original content. I'm all for not having it on the 1st episode of the season because creators should have credit but after that One should be able to skip intro."
"Incredibly limited app. No FF or REW options, no ""skip intro"" either. Also, doesn't resume episodes at all. Always have to start fresh if you stop an episode in the middle. Pretty lame app/playing capabilities compared to all it's competition."
"Every day since I downloaded the app I've had to reactivate my TV. It also doesn't keep track of what episode is next. I enjoy the programming, but the app needs work."
"Trash as of right now, soon as a payment was took out, now I can't even watch anything it just say MGM+ and goes no further, will be canceling subscription! Would not recommend! Ripoff!"
"Movie and show options are great, but the app itself doesn't work well. Seems very outdated."
"The shows are great but... The app needs a lot of work. Next episode resume play never goes to the start of the next episode, sometimes it will even skip multiple episodes."
"Have great movies, bit if you want to watch it on your fire stick or Chromecast with Google TV, the activation never works! Now I remember why I cancelled my subscription in the first place. Hey Epix staff, how about fixing your apps! The screen activation works on all my other services. Never works with your apps."
"It's not that the shows are bad, not really but their system doesn't follow the IP. Some people may like that but when you have several devices you switch between its a pain in the a--. This is my 2nd time starting a subscription and I'm not sure I'm keeping it, again."
App doesn't always work.
"They say you can download for offline viewing. But can only download things I don't want to watch, not the things I want to watch. Not to mention you can't watch on a bigger screen through your PC. Not everybody has a Wi-Fi TV. Also when you pause or stop watching. It gives you the option to start where you left off. When you press it, it starts from the beginning again, useless!"
"I don't know if it was my phone, internet, or the app itself, but I kept having to go back a minute because the audio would repeat and the video would continue so that they were no longer in sync. It did that often. Also the variety is kinda lame, just my opinion."
It's not a bad app. But definitely not worth paying for a subscription. I should either come free with something better or merge with another platform. I have seen these movies in other places for free. They do have a good show War of the World's but with only 8 episodes there are better options.
Great selection of movies but the app needs improvement. If I stop a movie and close the app the movie restarts from the beginning when I go back to it instead of picking up from where it was stopped. Fix that and I'll rate it five stars.
"We didn't really use this app there weren't any shows or movies on the app we were interested in watching. It seems like all the movies were old and I can watch them on Hulu, Netflix, or Prime. This app just wasn't worth taking up space on my phone. We got a free subscription by ordering pizza."
"Very good quality, easy to navigate. Unfortunately their selection is quite small and most of content is not current. I believe, the bigger they get the better the app will be but as of now, I'd say I'd watch maybe 4 movies and then the app will be irrelevant to me."
"The forward and rewind shades are always on the screen. Plus it stops a lot claiming that my internet is down when it is not. Have to close the app and reopen to watch. The TV Roku app works great, but not the one on Chromebook."
. I'm able to connect with my Roku TV with the tv provider on epix streaming but I don't get the promotional offer that I paid for. When I try to connect with epix now I can't connect my roku tv. So its backwards.I've done everything they suggested. It's aggravating.. epix now says no tv package but it's the package you pay for... revamp it epix
Has good content but it keeps having issues loading and error messages. I know it is not my internet connection because everywhere streaming service and application works just fine. Kind of useless unless it loads and doesn't have errors...
"Subbed to this to watch 2 things. One of them was available. The other was listed on the app, but when I tried to watch it I was told it was unavailable. Kinda lame to have something listed on the app, and then tell us we can't watch it."
Misleading app. Unable to activate my xbox one to app. Once code is entered it cycles you to a new page asking for you to purchase a certain package. Trouble shooting doesnt provide any help just basic restarting techniques. I am able to watch on my phone but not on any other device
I have been watching the show From and made it to the 3rd episode and now I can't go any further. A screen pops up saying it won't be available until Febuary 20th??? Why?
"I just start this app. so I'm not for sure how it is but, in a week or so I should know if it is good grate or A bad app. Will have to get back at you with my findings why 2 stars is for someone as taking the time to think about what is the best way to do a movie app then put it together that is why u give 2 stars I would have done 3. but they asked me to rate it after the frist day at running the app and 30 minutes later . To soon."
Can't login with provider
"After having gotten MGM for Top Gun and Billy the Kid, I have not been able to get in the app for like 2 weeks!! What is going on?!?!!!"
Lies. They say you will not be billed for the 7 day trial and then bill you 1$. The dollar ain't a big deal. Its the lying that I don't agree with.
"can't cancel even after the things you said to do. the last ""step"" was not even an option on my device! i have to cancel my card to get you to stop charging me! and, it is more than $5.99 that yoy take from me! This is one of the worst "" online purchases I have ever made!! BIG MISTAKE!!"
The app is super glitchy and it freezes and unsyncs audio channel with the video watching a show with a lot of sub and I'm missing a lot of dialogue please fix I love their original series that they have.
"It was good start off as 0.99 a month and it went up to 5.99 a month and its a recurring charges which has increased, this ain't NETFLIX OR PRIME...It actually don't have good movies like that!! I don't see new movies its the same old stuff and for that matter, where is KING KONG VS GODZILLA....THE NEW MORTAL KOMBAT for all that???? Please answer my question..... Mr. EPIX RIP OFF"
Buffering Now...would be a more apt name for the app. Too much latency in the app to be useful. The sluggishness applies to both the android and iOS version as well as my smart TV
Keeps pausing the just like every purchase app . Except Netflix that's the way to go might want to get better streaming because you have a good app if it would stop pausing every 10-30 sec.
Did everything it said to but it's not working with my Chromecast it work for half of the movie and then it just stopped so I'm deciding the council because this doesn't make any sense . everything else I have work with a Chromecast but this.
Well now that I was given that information I went ahead and changwd my review. So thanks for all the information that was provided. BUT now that was cleared up it's still not that great of an app due to not much is to be watched on this app but I'll give it 2 starts instead of 1 mainly 2 stars for the information about how it works now.
"Look, sorry that I'm giving a 2 star, I bet this app is good, it's just that this keeps coming up on my screen every 2 minutes, even when I press cancel, I don't know if it happens to you, it happens to me and it's very annoying."
"My cable company has EPIX onscreen, but I can't get the free Epix trial to show up. It only plays in my phone. Epix asks for a ""6 digit code"" to show on the TV screen, but I never received one."
"Mediocre to say the least ! Literally there was 3 movies that i found worth watching all the others are movies we all have seen a dozen times. If you have a feee subscription then you cant loose anything cause its free so try it and cancell it before the free month ends. *** MAKE SURE U CANCELL A DAY PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL, OTHERWISE IT MAY STILL CHARGE YOU FOR A MONTHS SUBSCRIPTION!!***"
"Good movies, but slow feed keeps going in and out of loading and sometimes entire epix shuts down to chrome home screen. That sucks."
How do I end my subscription? It was through the dominos app using the code. It won't show on my Google play subscriptions so I'm not sure if it will charge itself on my card at the end of the 30 days. Thank you.
"Downloaded wrong app. Now I keep getting notices about subscription payments. How do I cancel this, again? It's not worth the subscription. I see more reruns than anything. Disappointed."
App keeps buffering I cannot even watch a full episode without it buffering when I first installed the app it worked fine now it's not working at all it just keeps buffering over and over again
"Eh. It doesn't work with Samsung Smart TV so I never got to use it. Signed up for free trial, thankfully didn't spend any money on it, if it ever works on Samsung devices, maybe I'll give it another try."
Episodes don't play on their mobile app and etc... super disappointing when you pay for a monthly subscription. Not sure how long I'll hang on to this before I cancel...
Nothing to watch. Trying to cancel before free trial expires but unable to do so through the app or my Google play account.
"Does not work and i cannot seem to cancel my subscription. Have had less than 24 hours, have not been able to watch 1 complete movie."
"I signed up for a 30 day free trial through Dominoes, which only turned out to be 7 days. And as another reviewer said, can find the same content on other streaming apps."
"I'm confused by the claim to 1000s of movies. There are maybe 100 movies and you can only stream the ""live tv"" if it's available in those 100 or so movies."
The app itself is alright. Just expected maybe old school movies ive actually heard of. Found maybe 3 or 4 total and the rest were titles i didnt know existed.
"I got a free trial offer from domino's pizza and as other reviewers, there's nowhere to unsubscribe... hoping that I won't get charge $5.99 a month for it... only watched 1 movie while on free trial."
The app stopped working keeps saying no internet connection yet I have internet connection full bars and everything else works on my phone so it's this app.
"Needs work. Does not resume playback after pause, main menu is slow in a Shield TV."
Won't let me connect to my devices. Keeps saying something wrong with the code. I've tried it on different device same thing
Doing this horrible time with covid19 people are being charged to watch this app i sign up because i thought it was free when i tried to watch live tv it would not let me it was locked and it took me the 5.99 process im a laid off stay in home. SMH
I downloaded app and can't watch on my laptop which is the reason I got it. It's been saying it'll be available on laptop for weeks and still nothing. Unfortunately I'll be unsubscribing soon.
There is no way to connect to epix now on an xbox one. You can get a cable provider and pay extra for epix and use the standard epix app but not epix now.
"The movies from the erotic genre that I normally watch are not available.This is one reason why I keep the app.This is a great app with wonderful content.Please keep it that way.Was 5 stars,now it's 2."
The app never works
Worse time trying to get Epix loaded. Been trying for two hours. Subscription successful but can't activate code.
I can't delete my downloads and the app keeps saying it has lost connection even though my wifi is rock solid.
App works but if you are hoping to use it on your TV forget it might as will get it through cable won't work on Xbox or computer
Would be worth it if they had current and new releases like Till.
Trying to sign in and it tells me to try 7 day free subscription. I am paying for a subscription that I can not watch.
Constantly reads no internet connection:( I have to Uninstall and reinstall for it to work--sometimes that doesn't work!
Don't know how to get in touch with you and when my due date are for to renew or cancel. Also I have not seen a full movie and can't find a way to get a hold of you.
I had a T-Mobile promo for three months of service for $3 and it wouldn't let me redeem it because of your 7day free trial that I never wanted
No chrome cast option is pretty lame for a streaming service and it won't allow me to activate my Xbox app
The movies or buffing all the time can you fix that other than that it is good
Signed up with the monthly subsctiption but was pointless it sjows all the eonderfull TV show you could watch but cant because you are not digned up eith a over priced TV provider. Do if uou do not have csble it wad useless.
Couldn't keep it logged in to my wi fi internet! Could finish movies without logging on 4 or 5 times
This app ethics has lots of good movies but it loads constantly throughout needs some fixing
"When you pause and get back to what I was watching l, it started lagging."
"When I try to see something, the no network connection appears and I have to Uninstall and reinstall to watch something"
"It ok I guess ,but you can get a better variety on tubi or pluto and it's free."
Free trial... limited content unless you enjoy all rated R films. Not family friendly enough for me. 😕
Supposed to be added to my Xfinity account now it's telling me to subscribe try to put it in the wrong email and I need for my epic now to be on my account
Selection isn't great. Con: Only way to watch on a TV is by casting
Couldnt cast. Terrible selection in movies. Free sub. With dominoes.
"When I first started the trial it let me watch the movies, now it doesn't. My trial is for 30 days, commencing Dec 10th"
It's great just continually cuts off during the time of watching
"it's a fine a good app, but the one movie I am trying to find is Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, but of course nothing, please fix."
audio and lips aren't insync but still okay app
i don't think it plays good movies and sometimes difficult to start
Doesn't connect to Smart TV consistently.
Movies and shows are not available when they say its available
"Superior movies in more instances. BUT!! It's a LOGINN app, which I abhor, despise and are reiniscent of Big Brother!"
Crashes often; few configurable options.
Not very impressed with the movies 🎬. Please let me know how to properly uninstall this app.
"6 mo later: Music quality is good, but the mixes & what's 'up next' are horrible! Can't listen for more than a song or 2 without having to skip songs. Can't downvote if a song doesn't match the current mood or music, because it completely removes it. It plays whatever it wants to. Changing settings doesn't help. No option to import playlists from other apps. YouTube Red is getting just as bad. YouTube is far from too poor to improve or have a better algorithm. Too much $ for subpar apps."
"It does do music, but it's clear no one at Google understands was a music service is or as far as I can tell wants one. I get that video, in theory is a possible bonus for the platform, but their own controls to disable that feature don't work. What also doesn't work at all is enabling restricted mode. Off the bat anyone who has a family that wants to share their music service can't use this. Moreover thanks to the above it's possible to see stuff like movie ads and other inappropriate content"
"So I had Spotify before this app. I'm really used to the app but I do like YouTube music the big down side is when it's time for the next song to come up, it won't play, when I check the Playlist, it shows the next song paused and always at 30 seconds...which is odd, it never played. Also, the music will start and randomly pause itself when I'm not even close to touching my phone... it's annoying honestly."
"I've been having problems with the app pausing at random times (constantly) and having to re-add songs to my playlists again. It's not a big problem, but it gets old having to hit the play button time after time. Also, when you want to hear a song when there is no signal, and it's been removed from your downloaded list."
"It's awesome when it works but it randomly stops playing my music, and it doesn't show up in my notification bar so I can resume the song. I have to open up the app to resume. Sometimes when I do, it just replays the song. Bummed out because I bought albums on this app. Probably gonna go back to Spotify Premium."
"This is a decent app but I find some things very annoying about it. For example, the search functions to find new music or unique music doesn't work well. The download features for suggested mixes is mediocre and for some reason songs that I like fall out of my liked list. This is very annoying. This is happened to me four or five six times that I know of this. Update 4,2023 loosing ""liked"" songs still occurs. I unsubscribed from YTtv because of garage access issues, considering it here too."
"I accidentally turned off autoplay and it automatically finding songs to play and suggesting new songs to add to playlist. Could not figure out how to turn it back on. Needs more work on UI & settings. Not very user friendly, have been paying for several years now since it was Google play music."
"Alright, this app, as a music app on my phone, is pretty awesome. I get to listen to nearly anything I want. Perfect! A few extra additions like playlist sorting would be better, but all together not bad. So why is it a 2 star rating? This service IS AWFUL when it comes to use on Google Home. If you ask for a somewhat obscure song, no matter how much you specify the artist and exaggerate the pronouncing of the title, it will be a pain to actually get the song to play."
Great plan and price w/ YouTube premium. I just wish it worked. Music is always cutting out on me mid song. And whenever it actually finishes a song it won't play the next song unless I reopen the app. It would be perfect for me and a 5* review if I could listen to music without constantly having to pick up my phone to get the music to keep playing.
"Where do I start: the constant crashes, the apps seemingly inability to play when the display goes dark, or the inability to play songs even when you have them downloaded? I'll start with the positive: it looks nice and is easy enough to navigate. 2 stars. I was grandfathered into the app/service. Used Google Music and paid for the subscription. Never had a problem with that app unless I created it myself. This one...this one has had all the problems across at least two, if not three, phones."
"Have had YouTube Music for many years and pay for a monthly subscription. Really thinking about switching to something else. The past month my music just stops streaming mid song or doesn't go to the next song. Super annoying when I'm at the gym and have to constantly stop to wake up the app. I don't see any updates. And it doesn't matter where I'm at or if I'm using wifi or not, its the same issue."
"I like that I get ad free YouTube videos. However, this app needs a lot of work. The new YouTube Music Tuner option is NOT easy to use at letting you pick your own artists. The ""Device Files"" option has not worked on my last 4 phones. Will they ever fix it? Also, this app is horrible with Android Auto. You cant access Playlists, recent music, etc. It's a blank screen. Spotify app just works better at these things."
"4/19/23 Still a hot mess with some improvements. 1. Searching for music in uploads is too difficult. 2. No option to group or sort to your liking from your library. 3. When you like a song, you loose access to the lower menu for way to long. 4. Searches with the will take you outside your uploads everytime and force you back to ad driven content. Not cool."
"I pay for YouTube so I dont see ads so I want to like this app, but it sucks. I recently tried Spotify after hearing raving reviews on their recommendations, and it's true: Spotify is just so much better. YouTube music very buggy, little things are off (for example i have a Playlist with a guided meditation to fall asleep, YouTube music keels putting autoplay and waking me up, even though I've changed it a dozen times already), it's poor quality. Hard to share musical with friends and ratings."
"Update 5/13 - background playback issue returned with new update. Fix this for Android,!!! Love the app but latest update for Android does not allow you to exit the media player by simply swiping it away. This causes the music to continue playing in the background and draining battery. Google need to fix this asap, as. It doesn't occur on the iOS version."
"The search function when it comes to albums is currently completely broken, with albums not showing up when you search their names, which in certain cases like with broadway musicals make finding what you want to listen to genuinely impossible. I've tolerated a lot of UI I find clunky and difficult to use but this is frustrating and making me debate keeping the app"
"I'm probably going to switch to a different music app. This one glitches quite a bit, and I wouldn't call it user-friendly. It's nice that it connects to YouTube, but there are quite a few problems with the app. Oftentimes the music cuts out if I do anything on the app, like if I turn on my phone the music stops or if I exit out of one playlist it glitches. It also randomly deletes songs from my library, and I've run into issues trying to download music. Overall it's decent, but could be better."
"As many have said before me, I got the premium membership to listen in the background. I had this service last year loved it, got rid of it for finances, missed it so much that I got it again. Since I went back to premium this year I'm lucky if it runs in the background for 2 minutes before crashing. I love the music selection, offline mode, and the smart Playlist are awesome but none of this even matters when the app just doesn't run properly. Very disappointed as a returning user!"
"Really want to like this app, but constantly frustrated by it. Managing playlists, which really is one of the basic functions of any music app, is damn near impossible. No, seriously. For example, you cannot, as far as I can tell (and I've been using this app for years as part of Pixel Pass), search for *OR EVEN DELETE* a song from a playlist (while there is indeed a ""magnifying glass"" icon, it brings you to a global search throughout all of YT Music, not the specific playlist). So frustrating."
This became might go to and has been for a while. It has a good-sized library and the playlist are pretty good too. However I've noticed for the last month or so that it constantly stops mid song. And if it does play a complete song it doesn't always go to the next song automatically. It's as of it gets stuck and I have to wake the app. What's even more annoying is I pay for this app. I'm getting very close to deleting and switching to something else.
"Works terribly with Android Auto. I love the ease of loading songs. But about 90% of the time when I plug in for Android Auto YouTube music just doesn't play. I have to restart it, or switch to another app. This is the only time I use YouTube music so it's incredibly annoying that it just won't play. Also, the algorithm always loads a bunch of disliked songs to my shuffle mix. Should be able to limit poor choices"
"Frustrating I start a radio station and it plays maybe 20 songs and then goes back and plays the same 20 songs in the exact same order. Not a playlist, a radio station. Also, I don't get any new suggested music. I hear the same stuff every day. No variety. It's the same as YouTube. The algorithm is trash. I search for a video. It shows me that video, maybe 2 or 3 related videos, then a bunch of videos I've seen before that have nothing to do with what I searched for."
"I used to love this app so much. I don't even mind that there's no actual app for PC but since some update, it has become a pain to use. It shuts off if I'm using another app or have my screen on which was the best feature for me since I spent hours not doing much, listening to music, and trying to save battery on my phone during my commutes. It's not my headphones Bluetooth or my phone's because I tried it on the same headphones on a different phone with an older version of the app. Please fix!"
"Need to update App! The Music keeps stopping. I ove the You Tube Music because the song selections are great! However, you have to constantly keep hitting the play button to resume.This has been going on for a few weeks now and this is happening with every device that Im using. Please fix ASAP! I've decided to unsubscribe until resolved. I honestly feel that this issue is being ignored!"
"Might be a problem with the entire industry, but having songs from my playlist seemingly randomly deleted is not something I can ignore. If it's unavoidable there must be a better way to execute. Notifications for the deleted songs for starters. The ability to both delete the old version and search for a new one from that notification would be nice. For organization's sake, have an in-app notification queue."
"Objectively worse than Google Play Music. Can't select multiple songs from the queue. Can't clear the queue. The ""play next"" button only works half the time. They only just recently added the ability to save the current queue as a playlist. These were all features on GPM. A monumental downgrade. I only gave it two stars instead of one because, in its defense, it does play music."
"It's better for watching music videos than YouTube because it doesn't have those awful pop-up links (for now) and I'm glad they added the ability to download and play your own songs as well as play them in the background without a premium subscription (although I wouldn't be surprised if that was taken away down the road), but this still doesn't match the quality of the old Google Music app which also let you search within your own library instead of having to scroll down a potentially long list"
"I decided to try yt music to see how it differs from Spotify. After paying for a subscription, I found that songs pause mid song across all listening devices. I figured I needed to update the app, so I tried that, and while there was an update, it didn't fix it. 1 star because this app sucks. Another star because it had some old favorites pop up that I hadn't listened to in forever, which I will be listening to on spotify."
"Lately songs have been stopping randomly. I wear earbuds at work and often I can't pull my phone out to see it or fix it so the music just stops. Never had any issues like this before, thought it was my earbuds at first but nope, it's the app. Hope they fix it soon, I won't continue paying the subscription if I can't even listen to music without it stopping multiple times during EVERY song"
"Edit: Got to love the price gouging. Raising the price that much is pretty grubby. What else would I expect though? Trying to take as much as you can from folks just because you can. The shuffle is absolutely awful, if you can even call it shuffle. Finding songs in my own library is tedious. The library is huge and adding music videos is great but there is a lot lacking in basic uses of the app."
"When it connects to my car it works well. Somrtimes i have to pull over to force stop the app. When i want to listen to youtube premium, it stops playing randomly. Very annoying. It should be able to play music with no interuptions. Also, one time i had an alarm on my phone go off and it increased the volume to max while my headphones are in. I have tenitis already, it was painful. Very unprofessional from google."
"YouTube Music has been my go to app for years, The option to have my own Playlist AND be able to listen to it in the background (when home screen is dark) was amazing to me because I am not allowed to have my phone on the work floor. The music continued to play until you stopped it as it should. Now music stops constantly for literally no reason, you can NOT listen in the background because after 1 song it stops. I will be unsubscribing, currently for 11.99$ a month this app is not worth it."
"I have the Pixel 7 Pro and I pay for YouTube premium. With this app only, the volume does not change and get any louder from about the half way point to max volume. Every other music app including regular YouTube works great and the volume will continue to increase to max volume, but not YouTube Music. I have tested it on other non-Pixel phones and there are no issues with the volume. And yes, I have checked all the settings. Very frustrating!"
"Update: Still lacking in many, many regards. Google Home/Nest integration is behind an expensive paywall, rendering my multiple devices useless. The personal library of uploaded music is hidden to a degree that my years of carefully curated music downloads and playlists have become worthless. A very convoluted and cumbersome experience. Very disappointed still."
"2 months & NOTHING has been fixed. Music STILL stops playing mid-song. I've downloaded all the updates that have come out, none have fixed the issue. What's worse is lots of other people are complaining & YouTube Music hasn't acknowledged the complaints. Same issues for over 3 months that still haven't been fixed. Sounds like they don't care. So, I won't care when I take my money somewhere else. They have until the end of this month or I'm out. I refuse to pay for an app that doesn't work."
"Been using for a few years. Like others though, I've been recently having the problem of the app crashing and songs randomly pausing while playing on a daily basis. YouTube music was originally a good option for me because I could find more obscure things and video game soundtracks, but due to copyright strikes, they've become harder to find. Probably best to just get Spotify now (or pirate your music 🤫)"
"I used to live this app it was in some ways better than reg. Youtube... as long as u didn't pick ANY genres or artists in beginning of signing up, it had fresh playlists.... but now I can't even use Playlist cuz your commercials n ads are WORST than YouTube now. The whole reason this app was even invented to begin with was cuz you are not viewing videos. It's supposed to be a music player. Now I'm having to go skip ads every 3 min n if u don't it keeps playing or repeating ads. Frustrating!"
It paused on the middle of each song. Actually it didn't pause when I looked at my phone it was still playing but I couldn't hear anything. As soon as I skip to the next song it plays fine.... until it stops playing half way through that song as well. Pulled up Spotify and magically no problems.
"I've loved this app for the past three years or so, but all of a sudden for the past two weeks it will not load any of my downloaded music, which is the only reason I have a subscription so I can listen to music when I do not have service which for me is daily, also it won't even play a song when I do have service it always cuts out for the past two weeks, I'm getting fed up with it and I've reached out for help countless times and have received not one response. It's so frustrating"
"Ever since the last update, 5.54.52, the app can't download any music, claiming no space available despite my phone having 300gb available. And on top of that it invalidated my previous downloads so I can't play those either. Hopefully a new update comes through soon and fixes that functionality. I live remotely and need downloads to have music when I'm not on WiFi."
"The app has worked nicely for me when I want it to. However, when I don't want to use the app, it'll turn itself on seemingly randomly when I connect to Bluetooth. I've tried every setting on the app or my phone to fix that with no results. Now I just uninstall when I'm finished and re-download when I want new music."
"Normally, I love this app and use it daily with very minor issues. I can not explain the disappointment of finding out that your liked songs have a max of 5,000 songs per playlist. The fact that my older nostalgic songs get removed from my Playlist when I add new ones is absolutely infuriating and annoying because it seems like an extremely easy fix. It really sucks"
Used to be great. But now since the update I constantly have to go back into my phone because it just stops the song out of nowhere no matter if you are on wifi or cell tower. If there was a fix for this I would rate it 5 stars because the variety has gotten so much better in the last couple years. Please fix the problem somehow. It is just so annoying when all you want is a continuous stream. What has changed to cause this?
"My experience with YouTube Music has been great so far but something has changed recently. We pay for premium and my wife and I have noticed the music stops playing 2-3 times per song. We have to keep hitting play to continue to listen. Gets old really quick... If it doesn't get fixed, we're going back to Spotify and taking our 5 accounts with us."
"Love the service... App sucks. There are so many things that I would change. The app right now is not letting me cast. I have everything Google. Tried all the troubleshooting steps and it doesn't cast from the Home app or the YT Music app. Everything is Google including my phone and router. I have the pixel 7 pro, mesh network, nest max(s), etc. Your engineers suck that bad? Or is it a case of nobody tests anything anymore? The subscription is not worth it if the free apps work better."
"It's great, but why do I need to deal with an extra set of ads after skipping ONE song? It's like a few extra steps into being money grabbed. like I will probably wait even a few moments before clicking skip for the next song and I get an ad. Unlike Spotify the company waits around a point until they give you an ad, it's annoying too, but less of a nuisance after completing it. Like I probably had YouTube music give me up to 4 to 5 ads, each one is a ad after one song, just fix the ad problem."
"This app is horrible, I do not know what is going on but there is only so much updating you should need to do for an app to work appropriately. When this was just Google music (don't know the why it changed and I hate it) I never had any issues whatsoever. Now it seems this app never wants to play, off or online. Or it parts one song then the next songs show it playing but there is no sound. You force close to reopen and the issue persist or it opens and the page is black with a refresh symbo"
"I appreciate the recent improvements to song lyrics, credits, and customized auto-playlist and recaps! BUT shuffle is still broken. Integration w/ G Assistant bugs, Rarely good suggestions for new artists and no notifications when artists I've thumbed up release a new single or album. No way to clear queue and no play count or way to see which songs in a queue have a thumb up or down. Integration w/ Android TV and Chromecast is weak, I could go on."
"Hopefully, this latest update will fix the stopped music issue. When I'm in my car or connect to my wireless speakers at home, the music just stops. I checked my phone security settings and app permissions, and they are all set correctly. It is frustrating to pay for something that does not work."
"App closes when screen goes off. What is the point of this App? I can listen to my music on the main YouTube app. Both carry the same frustrating feature of closing out completely if my screen goes dark. Whether the music session ended due to remote inactivity. Well perhaps, I'm listening to one of my favorite playlists. Reasonable purpose for my favorite songs on personal organized playlists. Just let my music play whether my screen is up or I'm trying to save battery life. Please fix this."
"Tl;dr the app's user experience is terrible. If this app were not litterally FREE with YouTube Premium I would not use it, and even though it is free I often choose not to use it. Pros: Good selection of music choose between a music video and studio version of a song Cons: It's difficult to build a temporary queue on the fly. It really wants to start a radio from song Hard to tell explicit versions from clean versions Shared playlists/subs with YouTube"
Had been using this as my primary streaming service but just cancelled my premium membership out of frustration. Lately I can't get more than one partial song to play without stopping due to network error (even at home with very strong/stable/fast WiFi). Casting to another device is even worse - I might get 20 or 30 seconds of music before it disconnects. So frustrating and can't figure out any workarounds.
"When Google Play Music transfered over YouTube Music, I thought it was gonna be a smooth transition. Boy, was I wrong. This app is a buggy mess. ESPECIALLY if you're a casting. It'll start playing song outside of your playlist when you shuffle it, play a totally different song than the one you tapped to play, and it will forcefully go back to the song it was about to play even if you skipped it 5 songs ahead. 🤦🏽‍♂️ Killing the Google Play Music app was the worst decision has Google made."
"Abandoned by Google Another app that they decide to stop improving. They dared increase the price recently! 😡 Playlists have a big Play button, but not a shuffle button. Only in the context menu!? Tracks get deleted constantly, or are only available on YT to view as videos, not here as music. No light theme, only dark theme. The eyes hurt when the daylight is bright. No drag/drop option in playlists. Not possible to rotate the screen. I've only stayed to avoid ads on YT. Spotify time?"
"I've had this app since it switched to YouTube Music, in the beginning it was good, took some getting used to. But as I started getting used to it and got an Update, it's horrible!!, it keep pausing mid song some time multiple times during the song, it's quite ANNOYING!!, they need to fix this issue ASAP!!"
"I used to love YouTube music, have been paying for premium for a couple years now but considering canceling it and using a different app as this one has started to pause in the middle of a song or plays one song then stops playing and I have to manually go to the next song which is a problem since I was using this app while I work and I cannot continue to go to the app every few minutes. This is extremely disappointing.. I was recommending this music app to people but no longer will do so"
"the queue feature doesn't work. everytime i click the ""add to queue"" button on a song it doesn't add it, and when i open the queue it just shows me the entire playlist instead of the songs i chose to play next. there's also no way to clear the queue without individually removing every single song, really annoying issue. this happened on both my phone and my laptop."
"Terrible for free users ok with premium. Two ads every song some are over 3 minutes long unless you have your hands free to skip. And even if you listen/watch the ad you'll still get ads 3 minutes later. The fact you can't lock your screen to prevent battery drain or prevent accidental button hitting is insane. I find that I'll accidentally report, dislike, or skip a song I'm listening to while my phone is in my pocket. Basically just regular Youtube with a different UI and only music."
"nonstop nag to join paid service in ADDITION to the ads every 5 mins like on regular YT. intolerable. with a premium account, I'm able to use the app properly, but a fun seeing how it works without all of the nagging, it is a POS as a player. it is constantly losing my current playlist. where the hell does the playlist go? when I randomize a playlist and want to go in and delete a track or something, the playlist disappears. I have to start over. POS!!!"
I loved this app and it was my go to. But now it keeps pausing the songs mid song. You constantly have to stop and hit play again. It's really annoying and disrupts your day if your trying to work and listen to music. Unfortunately I will be moving to a different music app unless they fix this.
"It used to be great, but lately, I've noticed a ton of songs have been pulled from the app... I'm super close to canceling my YouTube premium account bc I primarily use it for YT music. I subscribe to the family plan, and the price went up to $23/m, which is crazy considering a lot of my favorite songs are no longer available... ugh... I like the no ads on YouTube, but I'm not watching enough videos to pay this much for that alone"
Not sure why but y'all are putting 5 minut adds before and after every song. I use this when in my car. I can't skip an add and drive nor is that legal. It's super annoying and y'all are going to cause a wreck. Adds should be limited to 10 seconds at the most and maybe occasionally an add with a minut or two in it. You make money off people who pay for premium so it's not like there's a reason you choose to put such long add is. Also. Make a feature were I can chose to not here clean versions
UI kinda sucks and makes it hard to navigate. I found some artist that are on Spotify but this will have to do until my subscription runs out. If they fix the UI and make it easier to use I'll change my rating. Also I HATE HATE HATE that you're making me have to go into the app and play songs that are too sensitive topics. Censoring music lyrics.
"I have had and paid for the family membership for as long as it has been available. Loved this app up until last month. YouTube Music will play a song or two, then stops playing until I unlock my cell and have the app open. I am unsure what has happened all of a sudden, but I am thinking of not renewing my membership if this continues. Any updates to fix this issue??"
Finally bit the bullet for Premium and found that very nearly ALL songs do not play all the way through. No Internet connection is cited as being the issue despite all other apps having perfect Internet connection. This behaviour happens across all networks I've been on. This issue was not resolved after attempting common fixes like clearing the app cache. I will have to go back to Spotify if this persists.
"Historically, this app was a 5 star. My number one complaint is that after two songs it stops playing for no reason while the screen is locked. I thought it was some sort of glitch in my galaxy s21+, but it also happens on my galaxy s23 ultra. It's not a service issue because it happens with or without wifi. This is a problem that continues to get worse and defeats the purpose of paying more money for the convenience of listening while my phone is locked."
I have been using this app for years. Have a ton of music. Scrolling through my metal list about 20 songs are no longer available. So now I have to go back and search and add. Stop deleting my f****ng music! I pay for your damn app. Also I type in a song that I really like and it plays all the stuff from music playlist that I already have. All Caps my Weathers and then starts to play my metalcore. This is why Spotify is better! Try playing the same genre. 🤦🏻👎
"Missing one major component; LANDSCAPE MODE. Would love to run this on my tablet, in the car, in landscape mode, like SPOTIFY does. It's annoying to have to flip the tablet, or phone, in portrait mode to do anything in YouTube Music, then flip it back to landscape mode for my maps, etc."
This app is improving. Big issue though. Switching devices. I broke my old phone and had a bunch of songs downloaded to it. Now with my new phone it says that songs are missing and when I click download it says already downloaded. I need to download it again. Please fix so I don't have to remove the songs and readd them! Please please please!
They have a really bad algorithm for music you want to listen to. It plays things I've disliked or bands I have no interest in instead of the same band or stuff I've already liked before and I have no idea why. So it makes me have to manually decide every song unless I'm in my liked songs. But it does have songs I wouldn't find on Spotify.
"Music library is extensive. The algorithm that is used to make auto-playlist is really good as well. However, I'm about to switch services because it's terrible that the app quits playing songs randomly and frequently. Most of the time it will finish a song and just not play the next one. Occasion it will stop in the middle of the song. On full wifi strength or full cellular strength. Doesn't matter. Updated thr app, updated the OS. Doesn't matter. Terrible product for $10 a month."
"YouTube Music absolutely sucks. The concept is great, but the user interface is confusing, and especially after the recent update, now I have to constantly switch between a ton of different tabs just to access my uploaded and added libraries. I miss Google Play Music. That wasn't perfect, but it at least was easier to navigate and understand. Please bring it back."
"For a time, the downloaded songs Playlist had returned, and all was good. But with this new update, once more, it is gone. Again, YouTube, if I wanted to shuffle my music, I would press shuffle. I don't want that though, so as always your attempt to be cool falls on the effort to be functional. Please, return the automatic downloaded songs playlist, make shuffle optional, and stop trying to fix something that is far from broken."
"Annoying that viewer discretion cannot be turned off when a song or video has been flagged as offensive. Now any time I want to listen to Rage Against the Machine I have to confirm that I want to hear each individual song even though I've added them to my library and playlists which tacitly means I want to listen to them. Fix this feature. Either make it a setting that can be turned on or off like restricted mode, or don't apply it to music added to libraries and playlists."
"Still missing features that Google music used to have. And for some reason, you can't pause a song while it's buffering. The use case is, I'm driving, with minimal service, and the music keeps starting and stopping. You can't pause the music unless it's actually playing, so is it's paused due to buffering, you can't actually pause it, it will just start playing again when it can load. Super annoying functionality."
"Recent update broke the app's premium features. Individually downloaded songs are now practically impossible to find, and if you are listening to your downloaded songs as a whole, the player gets stuck on shuffle. Also for some reason, downloads can be sorted by playlist or album, but not artist. Is this an alpha version of an update or something? I don't know how anyone would test this update and decide it was ready to go. It clearly has major bugs, and the ""improvements"" seem only half done."
"If you start a long playlist from near the end, the Up Next queue only contains the last couple dozen songs. So shuffling at that point shuffles only that subset of the playlist. Every single other music player, and, curiously, the iOS version of this app, loads the whole playlist in the queue, so you can start wherever, then shuffle, and still hear all the songs in the playlist. I check for this bug after every update. It's been several years now. Easy fix. But they won't do it."
"This is the first music player ever that doesn't let you sort albums by artist. Also, choosing a song while listening to another song shouldn't bring the player back up, a lot of times I'm just browsing and looking for something and minimizing the players again is just another step I don't need. Also, there's no preference in the search suggestions for things you have in your library. Also, just because I watch video games on my YouTube account doesn't mean I want to listen to video game music."
"Like many others have recently said, this last update has made it nearly impossible to navigate to songs last added/most recently added to my library. Continued changes like this seem so disconnected from the actual user experience that so many enjoy. This may be the tipping point for me to move entirely to Spotify, after running both side by side for a couple years. This premium service continues to fall short compared. :("
"I use it for the free version. Recently, I got automatically signed up to their premium service and it is terrible. Music doesn't continue to play with screen off, the next song doesn't load, the app shuts itself down when playing on background so much that I might as well play it with the screen on. Free is better than premium. There is no way I will be paying for their premium service at all. I'd rather pay for Spotify premium."
"The new update that happened earlier this month ruined the app. I enjoyed the way it ran before. I had a nice downloaded songs tab and everything was easy to find. Now, I have to do a lot more to find the music I listen to in downloads and even worse, my individually downloaded songs (such as videos of live performances and covers of songs) are pretty mush impossible to find. I find this update ridiculously tedious and I genuinely wish they'd change it back"
"I was forced to switch to this from Play Music (went Google discontinued it), and this app is far inferior. All of my music is sorted by genre and, unlike every other music player out there, YouTube Music can't play songs by genre. Getting to your device files is a pain (because connecting to the internet and looking for music there is the default), and they take forever to load for no reason."
"I've had this same app since around 2017 and they just decided to do an update after all these years. Now I can no longer listen to my downloads in the order I downloaded them in, and playlists are stupidly hard to find. My favorite, most recent songs are ALWAYS at the top of my downloads list, now, I have a hard time even finding them. App was wonderful before when I could easily find my songs. Don't know why they had to make these changes. Not sure how much longer I'll be staying with YouTube."
"They completely ruined the Library user interface. It used to be really easy to go back to recently played albums and view downloaded albums alphabetically (including a section dedicated to one-off songs you've downloaded) as well as view device files, but now its damn near impossible to even find those things. I genuinely don't understand why the hell they changed it"
"I generally like the app, except for this new version that updated. It doesn't allow for playback of download songs in the sequence of their downloads. It plays an unknown song that hasn't been downloaded. The other version plays the songs downloaded in sequential order. Please revert back to the other version. It works better."
"The positive: ease of transferring my library, clean interface, dark mode. Negatives: can't listen to both device files and music library in one queue. Can't avoid adding songs that I gave a thumbs up to in the app to my regular YouTube thumbs up playlist. Changing song order in the listening queue has gotten clunky. There is no way to stop the app from giving a viewer discretion notice for songs they deem offensive and pausing my listening queue. This is annoying when I'm driving."
"For this update, I like to keep my music in the order of most recently downloaded. However, the particular order I have for my download list is so messed up that it no longer reflects where the music is actually stored- and to top it off, they claim that the music you download is easier to find (which is a lie.) But when you go to it, there are new songs you've never downloaded before."
"Apps great, interface is great, can't listen to a song to completion because 1, it either cuts out and is choppy, or just disconnects completely. Have wifi in my home and it doesn't matter if it's a downloaded song or not, this app needs a huge overhaul. The computer version is pretty damn good compared to a lot of other apps for music, sad this refuses to work for WORK 🤣"
Still disappointed. Run for the benefit of the record producers over the users. Not enjoyable for random listening. I have thousands of songs from a century of popular music in my library. Yet I get the same songs in the same order when I do a Shuffle All. Lacks a working local offline pointer to keep track of position in the current playlist between uses. Keeps going to the top of the playlist instead of starting at the next song. Once again frustrating to attempts at random listening.
"It has potential but needs a few adjustments. 1. Needs to be an option to put Playlist in alphabetical order 2. For some reason this app will allow you to add music to the library, and a few days to a few weeks later you'll go back to listen to that song and it will tell you the song is unavailable. It happens all the time. 3. Need to fix shuffle music option. When I select a playlist to listen to. I have about 1800 songs and it will only shuffle the same 15-20 songs"
"The app pauses the music very frequently (sometimes twice a song) and there's no widget that shows on the locked screen. The music also skips frequently and the only way to ""add"" artists is to subscribe to them, which then clogs up my YouTube channel with a bunch of music artists and makes it difficult to find the other channels I actually go to YouTube to watch. The app needs a lot of work to make it comparable to the other music streaming services out there."
"It was fine before; played the music I like and let me go from YouTube to it for easier listening, but they changed how the downloads work and it's extremely annoying. When I start playing a song from my downloads, it makes a radio of all my downloads in a random order with the song I'm listening to in the middle, so it's difficult to passively scroll through songs and find a specific one. It would be like four-five stars if this wasn't an issue. fix it YouTube music."
"This was previously a very good app and it still is a good app but the last big update screwed up just about everything to do with the library tab. Now its a way worst UI, you cant find your single downloaded songs without puting them into a playlist, and the sorting is weird with how its done now. Personally I would like them to have a choice between the old and new UI, and I think the old UI was unbelievably better."
"1. When trying to pause on the widget I have to hit pause 3 times before it stops. 2. Playlists: I listen to a wide range of music but once I start thumbing up songs, it continues to play those songs every time, no matter the genre/list. Please fix the algorithm to base songs off of what has been liked rather than only playing those songs. 3. When moving from car to phone, playlist will go back 5-10 songs and replay what I just heard."
"*28% Price increase with no improvements! YouTube Premium is now $23 per month... Does not let me edit a playlist I save. I hit thumbs down, and it still plays it again next go around. I delete a song and it comes back. No volume leveling between songs in the same playlist, one is quiet, the next very loud! Spotify and Pandora and the rest don't have these problems, and they are way cheaper!"
"I have moved from this since they raised the price for family. I can get a better deal on another service. I have been using Google/YouTube music for a long time since it was easier and keeping all the bills in one location. With having Google pass and Y/T premium and Y/T music premium you would have thought that they would keep a lower price or have a deal but no I will be looking at the others soon and seeing if it is worth the money. Spotify for the family(ad-free, 6 members) is $15."
"Edit 01/11/2023: New update now prevents you from listing your downloaded albums in alphabetical order. Can't remember when you last listened to an album? You now have to sift through your entire library to find it. App is terrible. Can't purchase new music, during album play it won't shift between tracks without a incredibly noticeable gap between them, and each time a new track starts the first two or so seconds are either skipped or all played at once. Bring back Google Play Music"
"Been using this app a while. I really like it however there is definitely a playback issue where the volume goes almost nonexistent and back to normal. This has been happening since January. I pay for the service too, n I may just drop it if an update to fix it isn't made soon. There are other services out there for the same price."
"The songs that I'm listening to get dropped and cleared away whenever I tap on the widget from my home screen. I hear a song and choose to read more information about it, but the entire Playlist (randomly created by relevance to a selected song) that was playing gets deleted and now I can't even remember the name of the song or the artist... Also I would like for the Playlist created randomly by relevance, to be adjusted so that songs are not continuously placed back into rotation within 5song"
"App is utter and complete garbage in my experience. No matter what kind of connection I'm on, WiFi or mobile data, I can't go more than four or five songs without eventual infinite buffering when it tries to play the next song. Ultimately I have to force stop the App to get it working again.. You know what didn't have this issue and offered superior QoL's? Googleplay Music. Thinking about canceling my sub and moving onto a new service.."
