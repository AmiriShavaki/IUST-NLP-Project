"Great game, but there are way too many rocks. I can be playing perfectly well and having a great time, and then 4 or 5 rocks in a row come on, and I don't have time to jump over all of them. It makes you fall and lose your scarf and streak, It's very frustrating and annoying. Please fix this or maybe make it to where you can turn off obstacles in zen mode. Thank you."
"I am an occasional user. Fun side scroller. Zen mode is great for practice. I have some difficulty with the small screen due to placement of the 'pause' icon. Where it sits currently is a great place to control the game avatar (thumb not obscuring the side-scrolling screen), so i keep hitting that icon inadvertently. Pro: any length of play is enjoyable; old-school fun; invulnerable ""Zen mode"" Con: game 'pause' icon gets in the way, would be nice if re-positionable."
"I was just playing the original game the other day and thinking how sad it is that there's only a certain amount of goals to get through, and then I have to reset and go to the exact same goals again. I love these new color schemes and graphics, and the new music, but no matter how much I turn up the volume of the music is still very quiet. I have issues jumping over some of the chasms, they're just marginally too long to jump across. I love the wall riding concept. It's fun and introduces a new element to the game play, but I agree with some of the reviews the tutorial was excessive and gave me the same hint/tip over twenty times. After I'd crash-landed once, the game gave me a tip to back tap or something to wall ride better, which is not something that was in the tutorial."
"Amazing game!!! I love the detail and the amount of effort that was put into designing this as well as the first one but a job well done!! Also I wanted to bring up a problem that I've been having. There's music in the background and I like it, it's relaxing, but after I watch the first ad, it'll start glitching out and repeating certain parts of the song and it's super frustrating and distracting. Please fix otherwise I would give 5 stars!!"
"Fantastic sequel to a fantastic game. Lived up to almost all of my expectations but it's glitching out in a way that stops me from being able to pass a level. I'm stuck on ""land 10 backflips within 1000m"" no matter how many extra backflips I do past 10, it's just stuck at 80%. I'm not even being given the option to pay with coins to skip it. C'mon guys, this is the only game I play on my phone anymore, and it's kinda disappointing that there's no point in playing anymore and I'm like not even halfway through the levels."
"Incredible game! It's very relaxing and a great way to kill some time, with great graphics on top. Additionally, it's not too hard but not too easy. I do have a small complaint though, as I'm currently stuck on Level 52, specifically the ""Smash a crate drop while it's in the air"" goal. I've definitely smashed several crates from the Radio while they were in the air, but I'm not completing the quest. Is this a bug or am I perhaps doing something wrong?"
It's an amazing game and I really love it. But there are glitches in the sky when I smash a rock and it justs ruins the enviroments a little. And sometimes it has chasm jumps and quests that are almost impossible to do. I might just be bad but I highly doubt it's because of that reason. But this game is amazing the graphics are great and I saved alot of screenshots of the game. It's beautiful and the atompheare really feels like an adventure on an endless dessert. Keep up the good work.
"I think this is arguably one of the best mobile games. Gameplay is simple and fun, the aesthetics are pretty, in app purchase are reasonable and fair, very few ads. That being said there are some things that are very frustrating. Such as the game not recognizing I want to do a wall ride and instead making me do a backflip and fall into a pit thus ending my run. Also at high speeds some rocks/obstacles seem to appear out of nowhere and the night theme makes seeing those obstacles a lot harder."
"Easily my favorite game on the app store. Alto's Odyssey is a work of art. It is in my opinion, the perfect mobile game. - Stunning visuals. - Beautiful soundtrack. - Intuitive controls. - Exciting gameplay. The best part of that is that it never seems to get old. I would rate 5 stars, but a lot is overshadowed by the fact you can watch videos or pay to unlock things. It comes off as cheap and I wish the dev's would just charge for the game instead."
"The graphics are absolutely gorgeous and the soundtrack is beautiful! (gives me some serious Journey OSD vibes) The only problem I have with it is that the rocks aren't clearly identifiable sometimes so I'll trip over a rock I didn't even know was there (especially when it's night) and the flips are pretty slow. But other than that it's an amazing game! (I highly recommend the ""Zen mode"")"
"This is such a fantastic sequel to the first game. I live the new additions made to both gameplay and landscapes. The only problem I have is that the frame rate goes down hard when connected to Wi-Fi. It goes back up when Wi-Fi and data are turned off. I think maybe there's a background process for ads trying to preload or something. I just know I never had bas frame rate drops in tje first game. If this is fixable, please get on it."
"Honestly, this is a good game. The art is pretty, it's entirely playable without microtransactions or watching ads. There's not even that many pop-up ads on it unless you go to the home screen after playing. The only problem I have with it is the mechanic of a character I play as frequently. The character Maya is able to flip faster but she can't build up speed that easily. Unfortunately because of that, it's practically impossible to cross chasms, and I die when I find one almost every time."
"This game is good, and there are some flaws. Lets start with the chasms, they are a little too wide. When I make jumps I find myself just at the tip of the cliff and I crash. And the onlu way to get across them is to catch speed. Which in some cases is just not possible. Then we come to the storms/night cycle, its simply too dark. Most objects are too hard to see, and even the character can get lost in the darkness. Possibly make chasms smaller, and have an option to disable the storms/night."
"I beat it! Those missions at the end of the game take forever, but at that point it's basically zen mode anyway. This game is great. It's fun, relaxing, a great game to play while listening to a podcast. And I flipping beat it! Only reasons it's 4 stars instead of 5 are those annoyingly long missions at the end of the game and that even after turning off battery saving for this app (NECCESSARY), it still crashed sometimes after playing for a while (this wouldn't be a problem honestly if the end missions weren't so darn long). Still highly recommend this game."
"I feel like some people are missing the point here. This game is chill, first and foremost, and built for chilling. I love the light, calming music, which has all the right triggers caused by the game. The graphics are equally simplistic and pleasing to the eyes. The zen mode, the extra characters, and the discovery aspect are just bonuses, because a game that is so focused on being chill needs nothing else but mindless, easy, gameplay. The only thing that breaks the illusion is the occasional hiccup with controls, or the way the sand-board is activated."
"Almost perfect app, amazing gameplay, good music, and beautiful scenery. I do have just a couple of problems, as you get later into the game, more features are added, along with some glitches. The wingsuit can get buggy, and sometimes kills you for no reason. The music gets a little repetitive, but it's not a huge deal. Great game, hoping for another sequel."
"the artwork is beautiful. game play is similar to alto's adventure, with some new touches. about the time i noticed there were starting to be a lot of ads between levels, i also noticed that the ads respected the fact that i had turned off the sound in the app, which i deeply appreciated. i paid the $2 to remove ads to show appreciation for that, rather than just wanting to be rid of the ads."
"It's one of those ""run and collect coins"" games, but very different. It's very relaxing and has really pretty scenery. Also, a good stress reliever. But I give this game 4 stars because of glitching. When the sun is rising, the background glitches like there is something behind it. And when I don't make it over a Chasm, my player gets stuck at the edge, crashing over and over again. Noodlecake, if you read this, please fix these issues."
"The game is very fun. The challenges are fun. The graphics are beautiful. My only issue is that the game crashes when I get really far in a single run. Around after 40k or so it freezes and wipes my progress on that run. Very frustrating. Also a couple of the challenges seem to be bugged. For instance, I got 3 crate drops in a single wingsuit but it didn't register as completed. Overall a very good game."
"Overall it's a pretty nice game, both story as graphic wise.. it has a nice atmosphere and it's goal is pretty fun, the ads aren't excessive either, something you can live with, though it's not expensive to get rid of them. Though it lost my interest due to it getting more frustrating, I still play it cuz of the graphics and to still try to complete tasks.. but yeah, good game!"
"I mean, I like it but I was expecting so much more. It's just a desert version of the original game with glitches and lags. I think they should have made the games into one. I do think the animation and scenery is much more beautiful than before, but that's it. It's just a copy. Everyone is complimenting the zen mode and etc, but the last game had the zen mode and everything else too!"
"Several glitches should be addressed to make this a 5 star game. 1. When grinding on vines, the system doesn't detect that you've switched vines when grinding continuously and snaps the second one prematurely. 2. Occasionally when you are boosting and should smash rocks but jump right before the rock, it trips you up. 3. It would be better if the list of combos scrolled up when you get past the bottom so you can still see your combo score and multiplier. 4. The way the lemur flies through the air at times looks silly. 5. When you die, it would be nice if the stats showed your highest combo multiplier (and notified you when you beat your highest). 6. The game often glitches when you wingsuit into a pool. 7. The game sometimes glitches when you go from a wingsuit to a wall grind and puts the character behind the wall. Other than that, this is an awesome game!"
"It's really fun, but there's only three zones to explore. I was hoping the ruins would lead to an ancient aqueduct, aqueduct would lead to a city, etc. More board types would also be interesting. Maybe a Glide Board that gives more airtime? Or a Mist Board that gives a double speed boost on water? I would love to see some new things, even if it leads to a new game."
"The game itself is great but it needs some technical work. Most importantly, the game slows to a crawl on my phone, seemingly at random. That is, the frame rate drops to nearly unplayable, slideshow levels, and the sound stutters the way my desktop sometimes does just before a catastrophic crash. This game hasn't actually crashed outright on me, but it feels like it wants to when it does that slowdown thing. I will point out that I am running this on a Nexus 5x, the same phone I played Alto's Adventure on, and never had a problem with, so I seriously doubt the problem is that my phone isn't powerful enough. Secondly, the game occasionally loses progress. On my last run, I completed a goal (wallride to grind 3 times in one run) but on my next run, progress was reset as if I hadn't done it. These technical hangups aside, it's a great game and a very worthy successor to Alto's Adventure."
"I absolutely love playing this game. The visuals and atmosphere pulls you in as you surf the sand dunes of such a vibrant desert. One major problem I have with the game is Maya's inability to jump a specific chasm. No matter how much momentum you have or if you have a speed boost or not, she will always almost land on the other side but ultimately ends up falling. She's one of my favorite characters as she can perform satisfying combos. I wish this problem would be solved and fixed."
"This is a fun time killing game. Would be 5 stars but they cheat on the goals. You'll encounter something over and over again, and the moment you get that thing as a goal you'll rarely see it. I get that they want to make progress harder, but sometimes it's just too ridiculous. I've set distance records looking for a scenario for a goal that the day before I'd see several times during a short run."
"I love this game, reinstalled it after deleteing a long time ago. Still really fun to play. 9/10 recomend. When I came back, I notice that you added pop up adds. Going offline doesnt work. Those weren't there when I played this game. Lots of audio bugs, I mean lots to. Although they aren't to bad, kinda like them sorta. Game lags useually at the start, but not much after that. I wish the pop up adds were removed, kinda annoying when every time I die I have to watch one."
"It's a very relaxing game, just as the last one was. The soundtrack is very immersive if you put in earbuds, like the sound of sledding on the sand and the grinding on the vines and the music is wonderful and pleasant even after an hours worth of play, the storm and waterfalls are just amazing. And not to mention the detailed landscapes❤️ The only slight problem is that it's more sensitive than the last game and the ads are a bit more frequent."
"There are very few adds in the game that you are forced to watch and power-ups if you can find them to make the whole thing more interesting when ever you're not gawking at the scenery. The olny down side I have seen so far is that it can be difficult to distinguish objects in the back round wich do not harm the player and objects in the forground that will (Especially for newer players, not yet used to the game)"
"When I speed down the slope and do an amazing filp off the edge it feels so exhilarating . like I'm right there with Paz.It's simple, beautiful and the music is relaxing. I'd rank it up there with ""flower"" and ""journey"" from ps4. My only issue is that I wish it had a pay once and done option. The ads really defeat the purpose of a game that's designed to be relaxing."
"It's a fun game, very pretty but I think it needs polishing. Approaching high velocity rocks and trying to jump right before them will still trip you up. Dipping below ground level with the wing suit will kill you. Pools will generate right before chasems and ruin your velocity and cause you to fail the jump. And the fact backflip rotation speed is locked depending on the character you're playing is almost a questionable gameplay design."
"This game is absolutely amazing. Beautiful scenery, fun but challenging gameplay, and incredible music. Unfortunately, the music glitches and stops playing a few seconds into a normal run, while on zen mode, there's about three minutes before the music disappears. I love the music, and it would be great if the developers could fix it :)"
"It's a fun and great game I enjoy a lot! The ads are a bit annoying, but you can pay to get rid of them. My biggest issue is that there doesn't appear to be a feedback button anywhere in the app, so I have to leave my feedback here. I have noticed that sometimes (not every time) when I find a lemur, a few seconds later, I crash as if I ran into a rock, but there's no rock there. At first, I thought I wasn't observant enough, but it keeps happening. Once, it was on a vine, nowhere near the ground"
"Overall a great game but even after maxing out you're skills you don't get them very often. However, the minus 1 star is due to the game hanging up every now and then... usually after an awesome stunt or run :( this has happened a few times and I just started playing yesterday; once after a quadruple backflip and a couple more times mid-jump over chasms. Still, a fantastic game!"
"I originally rated this with 5 stars, but recently I've encountered a few issues with it. I still very much enjoy it, and I even purchased the ""no-ads"" upgrade. However, despite making this purchase, I still receive random pop-up ads. This is incredibly frustrating since I really did pay money to not see those. If that was fixed, I would give back my original rating of 5 stars. Besides that error, this is a very wonderful game that I highly recommend."
"A solid game that takes a tired core concept -- the one-button runner -- and breathes new life into it, thanks to stylish graphics and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack. As a whole, there's an undercurrent of Journey to this game, with its saturated color palettes, faintly mournful acoustic tracks and protagonist with an ever-growing scarf -- thankfully, though, Journey is one of my favorite games, so this likely-intentional homage sat well with me. I have to knock points off for the intrusive video ads that jump in immediately after every run, but it's hardly a deal-breaker -- I still heartily recommend this game."
"I have an idea for a new alto game. The idea is the next location will be based in a bustling city. My idea includes multiplayer and the game revolves around tag. Instead of a 2 platform game, the ground and tightropes, the game would have at least 3 floors: The roof of a building, skiing through the windows with tightropes, and lastly the ground to the streets of the city. The players get to play the cast of alto and friends, along with powerups and interactive map options. like shut a window."
This game is very fun! It's beautiful and it's hard but not too hard. I only have it 4 thought because after awhile it does get kinda boring and the scenery is no longer and beautiful as it once was. But I love how you can skip the tasks if you have the money I am so glad they added that!! And how you buy stuff to help you and longer lasting things.
I wish there was a better explanation for the canyon wall grind. sometimes it seems like the character gets too heavy to pass a wall high enough without falling to the pit. sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't and I find it hard to figure out how I pass the chasms sometimes 😂 I really love the graphics though. I love Altos adventures
"Great game! Very limited short ads for the most part. My only complaint is that during the times that the day and night change it's near impossible to distinguish a rock to trip over and a bush in the dark. However, beautiful looking game I have always loved the silhouettes, such as my favorite old game limbo. This game has the slight feel of that one."
"I really liked the design, as an artist. The animation is really smooth as well. The sound effects, especially the sand sounds. Overall, a relaxing game to play :) The only issue I have is that the hot air balloons rise too high before you can jump on it. But I definitely recommend! Props to creating such a great and addicting game."
"Love it! I couldn't find anything wrong with it! Smooth, fair game play with BEAUTIFUL art and breathtaking music... Except sometimes the music isn't breathtaking. Sometimes the music lags out like a broken record and it starts making a sound similar to a hummingbird stuck in a drainage pipe. Overall a wonderful game though!"
"Appealing and easy on the eyes. Of course there are ads though which is not too bad, most you can skip past but some you have to watch. There are moments with no ads. Game will challenge you with timing your jumps, which you can read in people's agrivated comments but not insanely hard that you cannot complete the tutorial. The environment catches your attention with it's simple yet amazing detail."
"This game is absolutely fantastic. The controls are fluid, natural, and responsive; the art and sound are gorgeous; the world presented is interesting—and I'd love to know more about it (even though an Alto story could potentially ruin that intrigue imo). The only thing that irks me is the ads—thougb they don't take away too much. Also, the in-app purchases are handled quite well—you can do them, but you can also earn your stuff (kinda like with Warframe)."
"It's great,I love the concept I live Adventure, I love the gameplay, but I hate how unresponsive the menu is. You have to tap everything twice, to restart, to go to menu, it's kind of a small thing but it gets unreasonably annoying, especially considering how small of a fix it would be."
"Beautiful game. I love the graphics. However, it's frustrating when the game purposefully withholds the very things needed in order to pass a level, probably in order to get you to watch an ad. Need to smash rocks with lotus flowers? Good luck seeing any lotus flowers. Don't need them? Here, have all the lotus flowers you can handle. Need to grind 25 walls? Here are 4 wall grinds...good luck seeing any more for 15000 meters. It's just slightly frustrating and insulting."
Super fun game! I spend too much time on it! One complaint: when I crash right before a chasm and watch a video to resume instead of restart but don't have enough speed to make it over the chasm. I wish it would start me off after the chasm or back up a little so I can get some speed before it.
"Between Alto's Adventure and this one (Odyssey), people have already given very positive reviews which I am in full agreement with. I love this game, but I do have one complaint/idea/suggestion. ZEN mode is the greatest! Or could be. IMO, I would have a much more successful and relaxing ZEN experience if ROCKS could be optional obstacles. ONLY IN ZEN MODE is all I am suggesting. It's tough to relax and ZEN w/ them in a ZEN-like, meditative trance-induced play mode. KUtGW."
"Great game, love the graphics- best pastel graphics i have ever seen in 2d games. (A gamer designers honest opinion) The physics are amazing, I love the level system where it makes you change to different characters dependant on the tasks. However the one thing I dislike about it is that, every 2~3 runs out gives you this long and obnoxious ad. Other than that the game is amazing! (Edit: if you can stay alive for a while you won't get as many ads [Yeah I know the game is frustrating.])"
This is a really beautifully designed game. All in all it's a pleasure to play but sometimes I do have issues with the controls. Especially with one of the tutorials. I'll complete a tasks but the system wont regiseter it so I can't move on with the tutorial. :(
"The game is so beautiful when it comes to its' visuals. The gameplay is simple which is great for this type of game. Somethings are a bit annoying, ads are annoying at times but it isnt going to break your experience. The Zen Mode is so nice to sit and relax to. I would give this game a five star rating but, the ads is a downside to me."
"I like this game a lot but every time I go on a long streak (50,000 meters for example) the game crashes and I lose all my progress, I don't get the 12,000 coins I obtained nor do I complete any of the missions and level up due to the game crashing. I hope there's something you can do about this because there's no point in playing the game if it's just going to crash every time I make progress. This also happens with Alto's Adventure, and I was hoping it wouldn't be a problem in this game."
"This game is a really cool take on the endless runner, which is difficult to achieve with that genre. It feels like there's an air of mystery and discovery to it that makes it very interesting. My one gripe is that tapping to jump over chasms doesn't seem to work well no matter how well I time it. Swiping up works though, which isn't mentioned in the tutorial. Overall a fantastic game."
Superb game. only issue is the wingsuit button is right beside where you would put your thumb to play. nibody is putting their finger in front of the boarder as it would block the incoming environment. this is easy beta stuff to fix. don't see why it was lookes over by developer. i crash because you put the button on the wrong place.
"Beautiful game to put it simply. The graphics are wonderful, the music is great, and the gameplay simple. I only have two minor complaints 1. Please ease up on the ads, it gets very annoying and immersion breaking and 2. the audio breaks up sometimes. Otherwise great game"
"Beautiful graphics, relaxing sound and music, and challenging without becoming stressful. Goals are sometimes a little too hard to accomplish. I also encounter 1 game-ending bug for every 15 minutes of gameplay (usually issues with object boundaries). Overall, a pretty fun game."
When I play the game with my wireless headphones the sound and gameplay tend to glitch out and sometimes even crash. Other than that the game is great. I played the original Altos adventure and I loved it. This is even better but it's very buggy. Hope you can fix it.
"I love everything about this game...whenever it works. For some reason, the app opens up and then, the moment I actually try to go downhill, the app freezes and makes a buzzing ""beep"" sound that's BEYOND loud. Sometimes it crashes as well. It's weird because I can play this game without any problems for one moment and then, in the next 15 minutes, I'll open up the game and it'll freeze once more! I've no clue what to do."
"I really like the gameplay. The artwork is great, and I'm enjoying the new moves compared to the original. However, the game slows down and then crashes every 10 minutes or so. I'm on a new Pixel 3 with very few background apps running. Otherwise, it would be a five star game."
"I really like this game. A few flaws... I'm not getting any haptic feedback on my device and that was a highly lauded feature in several reviews. Some random glitchy artifacts in the sound and rendering... dropped frame rates. My device isn't cutting edge, and I think this is a port from ios, so your experience could vary. Don't let this dissuade you. Get the download, and it's worth throwing the dev two bones to cut most of the ads (which arent too terrible.)"
"I really like this game. Unfortunately, I cannot give it the 5 star rating it deserves. This is due to the fact that I feel it is either poorly optimized for Android or my phone is just weird. I own a Pixel 3a, which runs the previous game in this series, Alto's Adventure, very well. There has never been any lag, frame drops, or glitches in that game. However, when I installed Alto's Odyssey, things were drastically different. The game lagged and ran at 1/2 of the fps of its predecessor. :("
"I want to give this game 5 stars, but this game does lag a lot, and could be fixed up a little here and there, especially for my phone (LG Stylo 2), maybe because it's a used phone, but even with the bugs, it's a really great game with an amazing soundtrack to accompany the game itself. The background is really pretty and this really is the follow up game to Alto's adventure, which also has an amazing soundtrack and took my breath away. I thank the devs for taking time to make this amazing game."
"The game was great at first, but then once you made it to all the biomes it got repetitive. I really wish there were more places to explore. At the star thg I was always looking forward to where I would end up next but then the new stuff stopped coming. This was in the matter of a few days. Other than that, it is a very beautiful game and I reccomend playing it."
"I live where weather and rolling blackouts can cause our power to be shut down and Alto has seen me through these bleak moments. Playing offline while the generator hums, has made Alto a very beloved friend of mine. The game has also been challenging and during times of stress, I find that Alto can relax me. Alto is more than a game to me. I really like the second adventure so much. I get such a delight jumping off the rising helium balloons and executing a trick off it!!"
"An awesome and relaxing game, with interesting challenges through the whole thing and beautiful visuals. My only problem, and a small one at that, is that some obstacles blend into the background too easily, making the game unnecessarily hard or unfair."
"This game is great, it's beautiful, colorful, and has great music. The only problem I have with this game is the ads. The game is so clean and nice and then out of nowhere a pop up add comes up. There is a way to fix this, maybe if you played a quick animation to prepare us for the ad it would make it a little less out of place."
"Fantastic follow up to a simple and addicting game! A great game made worse by intrusive ads between runs! Adding an X to close them after 3 seconds is one thing, but for a lot of them the only way to close out is to click the ad and then quickly exit out from the Play Store page."
"I love this game. The graphics, the music, the simple aspect of the gameplay. It doesn't even take much RAM, I play it on my 4GB tablet and there are no frame drops. But I'm cutting one star because the ads are infuriating. It plays an ad each time you want to replay or revive a life. In my case it plays an ad even if I spend my 1500 coins. The ads are loud, of some horrible games, and they actually buffer! I'm spending more time watching ads than actually playing."
"Simple but addictive gameplay, beautiful art and music, it's relaxing and fun. I often play it offline on trips or to kill time. A few characters to unlock with different stats but so far I always use the one with the fastest flip speed. There's some chasms usually involving wall-climbing that I can never pass, if I'm able to I just use the wingsuit. Also the changing lighting can make it hard to tell what's a rock, a tree, a climbing wall or the background, I wish it wouldn't get so dark."
"The game has terrific graphics, terrific controls, terrific characters. However, I have given 4 stars because of 1 thing. There is no option in settings to put the symbol for the wingsuit on the right side of the screen making left handed gameplay difficult. Please add such an option."
"I never give 5 star reviews because there's always more that can be done, but I have absolutely zero complaints regarding this game. I love every part of it from the game mechanics and its smoothness to the zen mode too, but the one aspect of the game that has my heart is the music🥹🎵🎶. This game literally brought me to tears😭 Well done guys, please keep it up🥹😭"
"Greate music, visual and gameplay, but there is one big problem: watching an ad gives u 500 gold (its too much) and u just lose your motivation to collect coins at all. U just spam this stupid ad to earn for something, i understand that ur trying to earn money, but reduce this to 100-200 gold or increase gold amount in rides to make it more interesting."
It is a shame that I can't sync the progress between two devices. That is why I removed one starts. Otherwise I would have gave it perfect store.
"Lots of fun, and chill. No pop up ads either, which is fantastic! Generally a good game to play for a few minutes a day"
"Hello Devs, I miss the mystery drop most of the time, timing seems little off, for the crates falling. Other than that this game is great."
Only 4 stars because of the ad BS bandwagon that they have to do. I get that they need to make money though. Otherwise an awesome game and very calming.
"overall i love the game, i know you may not see this review (developers), but if you do i have a small idea of what you could add. in zen mode, you could be able to select the possible biomes that you could see (a screen with all of the biomes, checkmarks next to each one but if you click on the checkmark and turn it to an x, you wont be able to acess the biome (in zen mode, i'm aware of the compass in normal mode.) i would keep talking about the game but, there's a 500 character limit. goodbye."
"Very serene and quiet, the only problem is that it is somewhat hard to see the rocks while sliding down hills"
"This game is absolutely fantastic. The art work is amazing, the controls are easy to learn, and the sound design is phenomenal. The gameplay is very addictive and you can play offline!!! Only reason I'm putting it at four stars is probably because of the ads after every second run and sometimes there are rocks that are pretty much unavoidable and invisible. Other than those small things this game is probably the best mobile game out there."
"Four stars, because there is always room for improvement on the path to perfection. I have fond memories of coming home after a hard day, and chilling out with this simple stress free game. The music is lovely, I definitely would have loved more variety of the same feel, that would be even better. Otherwise, I would sometimes turn off sound and music, and surf the sands while my playlist runs in the background. I liked the art style, the very simple controls and whole ambience. Thank you."
"Pretty good game for road trips or waiting, what I really don't like is that the starter character is awful, I've played through the game and unlocked all characters but the first guy is unplayable. If you wanna get your friends on this game they'll drop it. Another thing I don't like is that you can't see your all time high unless you pass it, and that you have to die to reset the challenges."
I'd love to see more uses for the coins in the future like an upgrade that increases the speed or duration of speed boosts from tricks or something. Finally I may be the only one who thinks this but it would be nice to be able to see how far you've traveled in zen mode. Otherwise this is a work of art and I think I may be addicted. Also bought the ad remover because the devs deserve some of my money.
"This game is amazing. I just have one problem. After the game finishes and the total score is shown, an ad is played. Now, I don't mind ads if they're optional (i.e. ""watch an ad to continue playing"", etc). But when an ad is played all of a sudden, it affects the game. After I exit the ad and play a new run, the game starts sticking and hinders my performance. I won't uninstall this game though. I love the music, graphics, and everything else except that one problem. I hope it gets fixed. Thanks!"
"Amazing game, beautiful graphics. A new adventure to discover. (I love the water pools wish there were more. ) I don't understand why it was not up for the 2018 game of the year selection. However the high score function doesn't work with my linked in account and there are a few bugs that interfere with gameplay. Also, it would be great if you could still find out about upcoming chasms when you're up in the air performing tricks."
"A good game but some problems from the first game persist. Love the overall simplicity and the way goals are used to level up. Ads are well balanced and don't disrupt gameplay. Well worth the money. However, too often levels will leave you with no way to gain speed over certain stretches, especially at the start. Radio drops also fall so slowly you'll often miss the majority of them which is frustrating when you've spent your coins upgrading these aspects. And finally, the character abilities are a little flat leading to a lack of interest in unlocking new ones. It would be good to see these issues addressed in the next iteration."
"I really like this game, the art is very breathtaking. But one time while I was playing, Mid way, I encountered a bug. The screen turned purple and white to the sound of the lightning. And when I crashed (probably into a rock), Lots of crash related text appeared in my screen. Please fix this bug. Thank you. ( That was my high score and I lost because of a bug :( )"
"I love this game, especially the music and how the background changes from place to place, day to night, stormy to clear. I just love the entire vibe from this game. The rocks do look similar to the objects in the background but it just adds to the difficulty of the game. At first, the jumps and the backflips may be hard to control but after playing for some time, you can eventually master it. Overall, this game is fun and just need more variety like game modes or something."
Love the artwork of the game and the soundtrack. For the most part it's a very relaxing game. The ad set up however really can pull you out of the experience....I feel like it's set up so I always accidently click on them and then I have to close them and go back in. Sometimes this causes performance issues and I have to close and reopen the game.
"Visually and aurally very impressive, gameplay is generally fun and not too challenging. Three things to mark it down. 1: the ads are annoying and really break the atmosphere the devs worked so hard to build. 2. As others have mentioned, at times it's almost impossible to see your character, which does make landing stunts difficult. 3. Wall riding is pretty hit and miss, sometimes it works, sometimes not. When it doesn't, it almost always results in a crash. Frustrating."
"What a great game it is, great music, great styling of designs, great gameplay, and it's just interesting and addictive. But the thing that keeps me from rating this game 5 stars, is the ads. Sure it's free, but it's just too intrusive and annoying, I even almost got it every time I want to play again after a run is over. But overall, what a great game it is, the download package is not huge at all, just less than 60 MB, but from that, we get a great visual with great music with great gameplay"
"This game is great, however I've been experiencing an incredibly frustrating bug that is keeping me from progressing. I'm up to what I think is the last challenge, score at least 350,000 points in one run. I've tried many times, but every time I get up to about 265,000 points, the game freezes and crashes. I had only experienced a few crashes before trying to complete this challenge but now it's every time I'm doing well. Can't complete the challenge so at this point there's not much point playing anymore."
"Not as good as the first game. Still unique atmosphere and art, worth playing. I'd rate it 3.5 if I could. Has a problem with achievements where I can't complete 2 even though I'm very positive I already should've. There should be some counter in the stats which tracks it. That's a bit frustrating and annoying, which also decreases a pleasure comparing to the first game."
"The game feels like an good improvement over the previous one. Love the new mechanics with the walls, balloons, the lotus is much better than the old feather and the option for the compass. Te scenery is awesome.  Just a few technical issues here: 1. The night time is too blended in / lacks contrast.. I cant distinguish when my character is upside-down when over a wall or other background feature, this could be easily fixed by making the board glow a light color at night or something similar. Still keeping with the night being too dark / not enough contrast, the rocks in your path may be easily confused with background features (such as bushes) and you smack right into them with absolute confidence. In conclusion the day night cycle, to me at least, feels like a mood breaker making the game a lot less enjoyable half of the time. More so it becomes irritating and makes me want to drop the game in that instant, which is a shame as i love this series.  2. In the the wall-ride caverns the walls show dots until the bottom of the screen but the character instantly ""dies"" when below an invisible threshold, this shouldn't happen."
"A beautiful, really well designed game. Fun and relaxing. But the ads are overkill. While you have to make money, enough profit should come from transactions to get more coins and ads to continue playing after falling off. Having ads after ending a game is too much. Would be 5 stars otherwise. Some minor points for improvement: the screen is too dim; I would love the option to play the standard game but with the zen music; the sandboard tutorial needs to explain better how to climb up walls."
"Simple game that is one of the best mobile gaming experience. Easily 5 stars but I am giving it a 4 because of performance issues. Since I upgraded to Android 9 there has been some degradation in performance. It's not too bad at the moment, but it definitely feels less smooth than in Android 8. IMO this game is reason enough to buy an iPad or a mid-range Android device. Be patient to unlock Izel to have your mind blown by thrilling pleasure!"
"This is a huge improvement on the previous game, gameplay-wise. There is more challenge, there is a lot more to explore, etc. Though the game gets repetitive after unlocking all three locations. There is also little point to unlocking characters besides Maya, therefore making leveling up more of a chore than something fun. All in all, this is Alto's Adventure but better."
"Definitely fun. A few little things to get the hang of, but that's all good. Very beautifully put together. I would like to be able to reset all goals without losing my characters, wingsuit, coin etc. Also would be good to be able to design my own challenges (or at least put them forward for consideration.) How about 3k coin in a run without a simultaneous lotus-and-magnet? A run with a 3-, 4-, and 5- (separate,) wall-to-wall jump passages? 3 backflip-from-a-pool-dives? I got many many more..."
"Great game and worth the money. I have completed both and have one bugbear (albeit small, maybe it's a bug) when you crash you get a chance to revive yourself for free. For some reason you have to press this button twice, the same as 'end run', again needs pressing twice. It may be a feature but I can't see why."
Very impressed from the beginning. Love the style of the game which felt almost therapeutic. Keen to get rid of the ads I paid $$$ also to get the coin doubler was quite expensive in my opinion. Also using coins to buy the compass you still have to pay coins to use the item you paid for...this is insulting.  I have really lost interest in the repetition within this game and I'm sure using two fingers to input could have brought more variation for doing tricks  and not just backflips.
"The controls are simple yet your able to accomplish alot with this. One button giving the correct situation does multiple things. This does become difficult when you're trying to grind a wall mid flight and end up dying from a poorly timed back flip. The music and sound of the game is great creating a calm relaxing experience. the art style both creating atmosphere of the game. With many a beautiful backdrop which would make a great wallpaper. The game is worth your time, the very lest your mb"
"Overall pretty good game. I don't like the time limit because it seems too short. I get that you don't want games to go on forever but, the time limit gets annoying quite quickly. Instead of a time limit I suggest adding a button that says ""end game"" if the game has last longer than 25-30 minutes and all players would have to agree and press the ""end game"" button. (Either something similar to it or a button everyone has to agree and press in order to end the game or add a longer time limit.)"
"Edit: well I can't seem to upgrade the game! Which means I can't play, I'm losing coins cause I can't play and can't get all my extra bonuses. I've been trying for days to get an upgrade to work, it just spins with the middle finger up!!! HELP I'm addicted to this game. Seems with the last update I'm at a snail pace to build up coins which is frustrating. My only other complaint is the time we have to wait between watching ads to collect coins is a bit long."
"2 things i dislike about your version of this game: 1. round timer I have never witnessed an actual game of uno taking less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds. out of 25 games, i managed to finish ONE. it feels like just after getting into a really good game where everyone has 13 cards or more, the match is over. 2. challenging a +4 card. not a rule of uno, it defeats the purpose of using a +4 card, and 90% of the time i dont want to challenge someone using it, but i dont have a choice."
"Downloaded twice and still doesn't work. It opens, it plays music, but when I press play or any other button a developer logo pops up and nothing happens. I can back out of the screen back to the home screen that is flashy and says UNO but the game will not work any further than that. Very let down. Update: Problem was sorted out. The wifi I was connected to had a security filter that wasn't allowing it to open. Game is very addictive which is a bad thing."
"A lot of fun! Uno always comes up with ways to play that are lot of fun and keep you interested in acquiring whatever they are offering. And the best way to get all the advantages is honestly, to spend real money to purchase items that will help you with that goal. But truly, Uno is a classic, and you don't Have to buy stuff to still have loads of fun! Lately tho, their ads are getting so obnoxious and repetitive, that I had to take a star off."
"There is a slight problem at the moment, it won't stop saying ""loading..."" for more than 4 hours or more and still isn't fully updated. I can't even fix it since there is no buttons to press to stop the loading process, and it's frustrating that I can't play. But I do recommend this to all, and love this game to death. But it would be nice to type to the players before a round of Uno begins and such more~"
"Great game, pretty fun. One issue. There NEEDS to be a ""Change Teammate"" option. I have gotten stuck with the same teammates who dont pay attention and make us lose. There needs to be an option for changing them out between rounds. Very aggravating. Also there should be a free play. While you wait for coins or something, a spot where you can play without coins or energy. No winning coins either but you could still play and kill time."
"I've been playing for possibly a few months now. I don't mind the few ads since they aren't intrusive. I have to say that since the latest update the ads loading are fixed now. Before the update, it would be really frustrating to have to get the ads to play since they'd fail and would have to keep trying until they would finally play. I have 1 suggestion. It would be nice if there was an auto button for an event where you have to click the same thing multiple times like the event currently."
"Love the game! :) Also love the fact this app doesnt have a ton of adds every few damn seconds; can actually get a good handful of games in before theres another ad. Edit: ads right now seem to be breaking a lot, never giving you the option to close the ad. It would only go to the app store. You have to restart the app entirely to make it go away. Plz fix!"
"Fun game as always, but not against the AI. They always magically have amazing cards while you get diddly squat. Every time they have to draw, it's a skip, wild, +4, or any other card it needs to win or keep up. Now I'm always okay with a challenge, but I swear these bots were designed to cheat or make you lose 90% of the time. This is just my experience."
"Uno is what I and most people (I think) would call a classic card game, and I'm glad I can play it online without having to buy it again. Plus, with this I can play it if there's no one to play the actual card game with. However, I have a small problem with it, and that's the bank thing. You MUST buy it if you want the coins from it. For free-to-play players, the bank is very annoying, partly because it keeps advertising itself. I think you should be able to get it free once it gets full."
"It's really good! It has many different game modes (although fun room is temporarily disabled) like classic, quick start, and wild! It's so fun! I only have two things I think should be changed. For one if the person who plays their last card has a draw two card, and you have one as well (or a draw four) you should be able to play it instead of automatically giving you two or four cards when you can add on.(Adding on is in wild mode) Second can we please be able to change our names? Love the game"
"Same fun and enjoyable game we all know and love! The one issue I have is that, even though I linked it to my facebook, none of what I did on the computer shows up on the phone app. Not achievements, coins, friends, etc. so it's like playing with two separate accounts. Otherwise, it's awesome :)"
"Great game. But the ADS are EXTREMELY disruptive. Some don't automatically scale to landscape mode (as the app, itself, is displayed). This forces you to physically rotate your phone to skip the ad. Also, it would be great if the ads didn't automatically interrupt other audio by default. Sometimes, at piercingly loud volumes."
Over all this is a great game but the only down fall is that a friend can only send you 10 coins a day. Which is disappointing when they try to request you as a partner to play the game but if you don't have enough coins you can't play. The game should allow a friend to send more then 10 coins when we are requested for a challenge.
I love this game. And since last night it just keeps crashing. One reviewer about it crashing said he tried to uninstall and reinstall.. I did the same and still doesn't work. I play this game all the time and now I can't. I have enough RAM too in case the developers want to send a feed back about that. Wth happened? It's so annoying.
"Although this app isn't at its full potential (although I hope that this isn't the best that Mattle can do) it does need some improvements. For one, get rid of that voice or change it one! It really is annoying especially during gameplay which is why I gave Gameplay a 2. Also can you please make it to where we can create our own usernames. Fix those two things and I will give this app a 5."
"It's a fun game and lots of different ways to play. Every so often, error message to download the newest version appears despite newest version being downloaded with no updates available. It frustrating with no fix. Also there's no way to play a two player version despite being available on all the apps replicating uno. There are better apps to play uno, but this one is still good."
"The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is cause i hate the time limit, most of the time when time runs out I'm just about to win and it pisses me off. Other than that everything else is perfect, you're allowed to skip every ad after 5 or 7 seconds and you better make damn sure hit the UNO button when you have 2 cards left or you're at risk of having to draw 2 extra cards. If you'll atleast give the option to take the turn the time limit off I'll change my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars"
Why with the new update you've taken away the ability to use voice to talk to friends. It should have been made an option to either use it or not or to accept voice messages by those who are not friends.  That's one of the things that made this game very unique was to be able to chit chat and meet people and talk with people.  I was able to play and meet and talk with people from many different states.  Please bring back the voice and make it optional per friend request. 2v2 Mode & Rooms
"It's a fun game, uno has been a favorite game of mine growing up but the only negative thing about this game app is the autoplay when you've timed out. The autoplay sometimes turns on halfway through the timer or sooner before the timer is even over and automatically puts a card in even when I clicked on a specific card. This irritated me because it caused me to lose a couple games that way and I didn't even time out. That needs to be fixed but other than that it's a fun game to play."
"Pretty fun. Wish there was a way to use your coins to buy different stuff though (card swap, blocks from +4) like the last version. Also, they need to do something about the pple that waste time away when the timer gets down to the last 30 seconds or so. Super annoying."
"The game is really good overall it's fun and addictive, but I always loved having jump ins when I would play irl, I'm just waiting for that to be added at this point, because those were so nice! I think it would also be better since there is a time limit, sometimes I can't finish a game in time and that can benefit me, or it won't so much, so I think jump ins would be even better because of that, please add jump ins! I've been waiting for so long 😫"
"To everyone who is new to the game, or to those who are too stupid to figure out how the +4s work and the challenging system behind it. Let's say the color is blue, you have blue cards but instead you decide to play a +4. If the next player challenges it and they think that you had blue's that you could have played then you will have to pick up the four cards. Your +4 are a last resort, it's not something you can play whenever you want. If you have the color and they challenge it, you will lose."
"This is an updated review from the nasty one I left some time ago. This is a fine app from the start, and it works. It features a mandatory tutorial for the players who are new to Uno at the very beginning of the game. It's certainly a clear and understandable platform to play Uno on. I wasn't very happy, for the short time that I played it, with the turn timer feature, as this defeats the purpose of strategic card playing. It's just colorful and fast-paced overall. A good game to play overall."
"LOVE THIS GAME! However, I think there should be a 3-5 second timer for all players to put down a card or pick one up because some players like to abuse the last few seconds of the timer and not put a card down or pick one up and it just wastes the other players turns because some people are ignorant and can't take a loss."
"Its a good game. But theres stupid functions that ruin the experience. First off, the timer, I have yet to have a game end by playing. It is always ended by the timer and a winner is randomly selected. Its ridiculous. Nobody plays timed uno, its a worthless mechanic. Secondly, the stacking, you shouldn't be able to stack a +4 on a +2, it makes no sense, and then you cannot stack another +2 on a +4? How does that make any sense?"
"I really enjoy this game! Playing it all the time! I have one complaint though, The fee you have to pay in order to do a match is a bit annoying, I feel like matches should be free- So if you loose you wouldn't loose the 30-40 extra coins you payed to play the game and then quickly become broke. Otherwises, I love playing it to pass time and my family thinks im insane when I say I love the Mobile Uno Game!"
"I take back what I said sometime time ago, there has been a lot of positive changes and new system and features to help ALL players and keep it fun for everybody. I've been very addicted to it, though it still pains me when I lose all my coins but, hopefully, now there are many ways to obtain coins and keep it rolling. I want to give it 5 stars to be fair, however, I'm going subtract one star for the fact that the players communication system has not been supported enough in the game."
"It's a fun game and generally is a good way to take time off and it's addictive. But, there are ads popping up out of bo where which makes it more difficult to play. The game also freezes which makes it auto play a move that would end up with me losing. But it is a pretty fun game to play I'm general. Just the freezing and the ads are the problems."
It's very very interesting game. I liked it it's way more challenging but when we loose money we have to pay or purchase it. Please make game equal for everyone. Unable to purchase the amount. Apart from that too good game.
"It's really addictive. But I would give 4 stars since the ads really irritate me. Plus, it would be much more perfect if we could play with offline(even if it's with a bot I won't complain) since I would lose my coins while my network were weak while playing. Other than that, I really enjoy it"
Very good game indeed. The only problem is that you have to turn on internet to play. There should be a feature to play offline with the computer. That would improve the game very much. A very good example of this is ludo king.
"I used to really love this version of uno, but seems the game bots are automated to take away those big points. Other than that, it's a really fun game, I love it when the other players throw objects when I'm winning or loosing. Great ""pass time"" but this game can be addictive."
A very enjoyable game it's fun and addictive but the coin system feels useless you can't do much with the coins unless you want to play more and if you don't have coins you have to watch ads to gain at least the minimum to be able to play again
"Brilliant app in general, but its only 4 stars because there is an UNO™ game that I have at home. Its called UNO EXTREME™ and instead of drawing cards there is a machine that if you press a button on it, it shoots out cards. So if you could add that it would be 5 Stars. Thank you! =-)"
"⚠️Please read before you play⚠️ This app is a really good don't get me wrong, but everything in this app cost alot of money and is really expensive. For example for special cards it cost at least 10 dollars which is ridiculous!! I don't recommend spending your cash but that's on you. Enjoy the game 🙂."
"How can me and my friend play together against random strangers? I can't figure it out.----------------- Thanks for the answer. I'm sorry for wording it incorrectly. I actually meant, how can I play against my friend and two other strangers in the ""Single"" game mode? Thank you."
"This game is quite addictive. You can play without purchasing if you have patience to wait for coins. My only niggle is the throwing of eggs at other players, which seems an unnecessary addition. Anyone struggling with a mental health issue may find this demoralising and people have enough to contend with in their daily lives. Games are meant to be uplifting I feel."
"UNO.... Why am I stuck on the same trophy for months. You won't let me move forward always going back to 0. That's not right how you are running this game. Ok, if someone loses pause it and when someone wins they move forward. Keep going backwards is NOT FUN 😡"
I like it...best time pass Game but sometimes they eat all coins which i have won....and you can give audio option for team member to communicate and play it will help to win the team...and join the partner team as the level wise don't join the person who is in low level because low level partner makes us Loose the game they don't have that much thinking power...all the best team keep on rocking..... please only update this kind of good things..
"Overall I love playing this game, my high rating has to do with the game. I believe there is an issue with bots. I played 1 vs 1 mode on two occasions and on both occasions I didn't get to play a card, the opponent had all action cards and the match was over in less than 10 seconds overall I lost 20k in coins and only played 1 card. There is no way to review, so I am back at square 1"
"Hi team uno, I downloaded this app months ago and i even suggested this app to others as i loved it.but unfortunately two days ago i updated the app and from then on i started losing games out of 30 i rarely won 6 to 7 games.i know in games wining and losing is common, we should accept it but now it's really disappointment .i didn't had this kind of experience before.actually i was about rate this app 5 but unfortunately.....so kindly look into this matter as i love this app. Thank you"
Fun game but the amount of adverts is insane. Also each time you load up the game there will be pop ups begging you to buy meaningless packs of virtual currency and customisable extras. No ability to play Vs AI while offline either
"Liking the game so far..except I am all out of coins ;-; so can't play for some time. I recommend a mode where you pay nothing but gives out 50 coins if you win. Kind of like a farming mode? Please do consider this, thanks"
very fun 10\10 for almost everything except that u need WiFi to play it.. Last time I checked when I didn't had internet to play the game and yh I couldn't it needed WiFi I think that maybe it would be more fun with and without wifi
love this game but wish it was easier to get money for games if you lose what you have. waiting for the spins ever 24hr is ok but there could be watch a add to get 100 coins when you need them
"Its uno fun and easy to understand. I do not like the overall 3 minute time limit, most games end before 3 minutes but others dont so I dont see the need for an overall game time limit"
"This game is very fun and entertaining. I play it very often in mobile. but some things are in UNO but can't be found in this game; I've heard that in UNO, If you play 7, You would have to swap with an opponent. Or when You play 0, All the cards have to be swapped. Maybe You didn't put these features in because they can be annoying but there should be a way to enable this."
I love this soo much but I took 1 star because after bankrupt 1-3 times we need to wait for an entire day to get some coins. plz give 100-200 coins after bankrupting.
"Ridiculous amount of ads for other games. Have to endure an ad between games. If you can't afford to offer this game, then take it off. Update: this game is rigged. How can you lose 10 games in a row!? This game is set up that way. You run out if points and have to spend money to get more. Game is rigged!!!!!"
Ever since the new update the wild cards seem off a little. Sometimes it picks a different color than the one I chose.
Excellent game!!!There is only 1 problem that the narrator is too annoying.It would be great if the narrator was not so annoying.
"It,s great but it,s very annoying with the ads and i think it,s kinda boring so i rate it a 4 star i hope it still helps but like i said not a FAN!"
"Game is decent, has different modes and customizations. Takes coins to play but easy to get for free daily and keep playing. Ranked mode is bad, people are encouraged to hold their turn till timeout to get better score or win when they should not have. Overall is okay for breaks at work if you like UNO in general but not if you want something competitive to play. Edit for devolper response: then ban people constantly reported for idling? Either way, all modes especially ranked have this issue."
It's great and fun but the thing is the ads are soo ANOYING everytime the match is done there is always a add but overall this game is pretty fun
It is a very good game but you should be able to have coins even if you lose a game but it's a very fun and active game to play with a family or friends
"I love the game but the calculation of the point system seems unfair... even when you win, you lose coins."
"It's fun, but I don't like the constant ads after every 3 games, I came here to play games, not watch ads, but above all, it's a fun and addictive game and i recommend playing! 🤪"
"Every time, it says I should download the new version 😒 when I download it, then it doesn't work, and I have to download 3 or 4 times 😑 it's frustrating and it takes lots of data always downloading"
It's fun to play with friends and fun to play solo. I do wish there was a way (watching ads or something?) To get more free games with friends & people you know!
"I love this game, however I purchased a large amount of coins . The next day I come to play and all my coins were gone... When I logged out the night before they were there... I feel ripped off...very disappointing"
Couldn't play b4 kept getting stuck on the loading screen that resolved itself but just a fair warning most ppl you play 2v2 with are dumb thinking the goal of the game is to hold all the cards
"This is a GREAT recreation of the cult classic, but the friendly matches limit NEEDS to be removed, and more versions of UNO, such as Flip, Flex, Dos and All Wild NEED to be added."
4 stars just because I keep losing coins and as we can't play without coins i should just wait for next day to get some coins. wish there can be some mode where we earn some coins without losing the coin
"As great as this game is. Just wish you can play with more then 4 people. There is 6 in our family, so two have to miss out on every game"
I like the game. Its very nice apart from the part that there's ads when there are no rewards. And when I watch an ad for a reward sometimes I get the reward sometimes I don't. And please make the time limit a bit longer because alot of people like me play on small devices so we take a bit to put the cards so please increase the time limit. Other than that the game is nice 😆.
This is just a recommendation. With the collection card. Instead of having to press them over and over again why not when each different card is pressed it automatically calculate the new card and give stars for the ones already collected. I am a player that let my cards build up and I hate having to open them one by one.
"The game is good, it's really interesting, although, there is a few bugs that really annoy me. First, whenever I try logging out from my guest account, it keeps just logging me back it which means I'm stuck with that account. The next one is that I cannot for some weird reason log my Facebook account into this game. It's so annoying."
"Great game. 👍 I love UNO, But it's pretty sad that I can't play it offline. Like when you're bored in a waiting room or you're on a long trip this game is not very useful if you don't have WiFi. I recommend if you're bored out of your mind at home (and have WiFi). I don't recommend if you have no WiFi on hand. I mean they don't really shove ads down your throat so yeah. Even if I don't belive I'm playing with actual people the app is overall great. 👌"
I love UNO but the fee to play the game is frustrating but otherwise the game is amazing. But if you're on mobile you can't type your own name. I get that you want to make the games go fast but I think the turn countdown is too short and so is the game timer.
"It's more fun playing with the app for me. But when i have 0 coins, coin store pops up. Like bro i know where the store is. It's just annoying, most of the time i accidenly clicking record thing while tryna close the coin store after the match ends. i understand you guys need to gain money but it just annoying ppl tryna have fun."
"Good game. Just wish you didn't have to spend so many coins for each match. The shields are a gimmicky mess, a lot of players won't do anything in the matches even if you say something, and the card themes are interesting but I don't want to shell out more money just to get last cards in the deck. Lucky Spin is okay, but the Gacha or whatever they're calling it is limited at best and unfair at worst. Nice that there's an auto mode whenever I don't feel like making a decision on what card to play"
"This game is really fun and addictive, however, sometimes when a player throws a Draw 4 card with a certain color and their opponent challenges them, the player who threw the Draw 4 card is forced to draw 6 cards. It must be a computer glitch, but it's really irritating to be forced to draw 6 cards when you honestly had the color of the card already!"
I love this app but I have some concerns like when I 4 plus around the last 5sec the person just waits for the time to run out and then they win also when the match ends and somebody has the same amount of cards and the same number (meaning we were tied) they just say that the other person won.plus if a person has not joined a club u that person can't chat with there friend which is really annoying except from that the app is amazing 😋
"Great game, but there's a lag when i finish a game and get one of those interactive ads where i can click on it.. The picture freezes and i can't do anything but exit the game and start it up again.. That happens frequently"
"I can say that this game is surprisingly addictive! But I have to admit, the ads are annoying..Most of the ads are 30 seconds long and you can't skip it earlier which makes it annoying and a waste of time. And second, the loading screen takes very long for some reason, even if I have perfect WiFi/Data. It would've been 5 stars if these wasn't a problem, the most I can give is 3-4 stars, since I really like this game very much I can give 4 stars. I hope you can improve better, wish you guys luck!"
Give the access for people to text anything while playing. It's irritating to store up the frustration beacuse of some dumb teammate.
It's really a good game but i rate it 4/5 I give it 4 because its a bit lag but still this is really good i can even play with my friends i love this
"It's astonishing that other players experience stuff that makes it seem like the game is forcing them to use coins, but I never experienced them and idk why. I only ever play big when I have too much coins, and I win more than I lose most of the time. There are strategies and some special cards to help you win though. That's probably the only thing you need real money for so you could win. But they don't guarantee a win. At the end of the day, it still depends on you to win. I never used 💸 too"
"Unable to use any of the phrases which I've claimed like change to yellow, +2, wild etc. I've claimed all of them and still nothing."
Apps is excellent but if calling option or the chat option is available it will be more fabulous.
game play is fun & addictive but i dont like how u can only use shields one time even tho most of the ones i have applied to my games say they last 7 days. ive used 11 shields already. its really misleading considering it says they were supposed to last 7 days. if u try to click on the shield in the bag tab it doesnt provide any information that its only a one time use kind of thing. i would appreciate that after applying a shield it would last the allotted time not just for one game. thanks.
Very interesting. Please add text and voice chat option to make it more interesting.
It's a very good and fun game.. But I would like to make a request. After every game there is an ad .. it's so annoying sometimes.. If the authority can do something about it...it would be helpful
I like it to kill some time. Would give it five stars but I think it's gotten too complicated with all the extra stuff to collect and do. But you can play with friends and play basic uno which I enjoy.
"Edit ; if some player's are happy by throwing each other's by eggs and tomatoes , at least plz make it as optional so i can stop it or activate it , i dont like it at all really its very destirabl and used stupidly by some player's, App is perfect , but the app system is not fair and determines who wins , the app will be 5 star if you make it only by Player's skills and luck , without system Unfair interference ."
I really like the game but it always whants you to buy something from it and I think you don't get enough time my family uno takes a hour or 30 minutes and they give you 3 minutes usually when I have four people we need 20 minutes or 10 but that's just my opinion but it is fun I play a lot and I can enjoy the game
I think you should add a feature of friends chatting. It will really helpful to all the players..
"The game is very entertaining. But we can,t stop the game. One day me and my friend were playing a game and she left I started playing with a robot."
Very challenging and fun. Only thing I don't like the games are timed and you don't play up to a certain amount.
"Very nice game, I keep winning, but there's a problem, the opponents don't play very well and they play like noobs"
Love it but too much going on on the home page too many side things too much everything it's overloaded and now u pay to play persay* and only 3min rounds like wth
SUCH A GOOD GAME PLAY IT NOW I LIKE HOW TEAMWORK MADE BY PLAYONG WITH OTHER PLAYERS I LIKE IT SO MUCH ! GIVING IT 4 STAR BECAUSE IM JUST A NEW IN THIS GAME AND I WANT TO EXPLORE MORE GAMES ABOUT UNO AFTER GIVING THIS 5 STAR BUT I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH THANKS FOR MAKING THIS GAME KEEP IT UP PLAYERS!!
Introduced to this game by my young niece and now I think I'm addicted lol xxx dropped a point because I seem to get stuck in a loop when w@tching ads.
"the game is addictive and nice, the bad part is the ads, they get stuck lately and cannot continue until I close the app and open it again. really annoying ! please fix it."
"Addictive game but a lot of bad players 🤦🏽‍♀️. Random 0 IQ players just make you loose. But also classic is the best to avoid loosing much. Please pair new players with their kind. It's not okay to loose over someone not using the UNO button correctly. Also, more dialogue cuz it's only fair you express yourself when things get heated."
This game doesn't give 2 cards instantly when we clicked gotcha and doesn't ask that we sure to play a card i by mistakely many times played +4 and got challenged myself because then don't ask
Remove challenge option not work for me when opponent player challenge me all of the time I have to take the card not fair at all other wise game is pretty good
"It's fun, until it's not. Challenge as an option for +4cards is ridiculous! At this point you're just making up rules. Why don't you just add a bonus roulette wheel if you need to gamble.. oh wait, there is one already..well aren't you clever!"
"I enjoyed this game a few years ago, and it's proven fun to revisit. It's not very complicated, and the story is ""subtle"" but, the gameplay kept me coming back every so often. You drag your finger up, down, left, or right to control the main character, often in time with icons you run across in order to perform special tricks. There are coins that can be gathered throughout the levels that are used to purchase those tricks I mentioned earlier. Keeps you entertained when sitting idle for a moment"
"This game is great but like many other people the controls are extremely rough and glitchy. Graphics: Great. Gameplay: Great. Controls: not so great. I think it would be easier to control with a joystick or arrow keys on the screen, not a joystick or arrow keys in real life, though thats pretty obvious. It is not a demand, just a suggestion. The game might have not been updated in a long time but I think its still possible you will update it again, I dont know when, but its still possible."
"the game Vector is a really good idea featuring a Twist on platformer, as you are being chased through every level by security guard. The gameplay and graphics are exceptional for a mobile game, and gives no lag or high ping to the game itself. How ever, the mechanics behind when the security guard passes you need major improvements. The security guard is supposed to turn around when he passes you, but that doesn't always happen... and sometimes you can get back ahead of him if you're careful on depending on the environment. Great game, great graphics, controls need minor improvement, security guard behavior is somewhat broken."
"Simple and intuitive gameplay, wonderful art style, and plenty of content. No intrusive microtransactions and respectful amount of ads, as well as an optional premium which removes ads among other benefits. Needs more music; game only has one or two soundtracks, and it only switches once or twice. Music gets really repetetive. Ending is too abrupt and unsatisfying; could've done more to reward player for winning. Overall, fantastic game but could be a bit better."
"a very interesting albeit agrrivating game. some levels are inconsistant in difficulty spikes and other routes are just downright never going to be found by any logically thinking person. but that aside, i love the green screen animations and how smoothly they connect to eachother, i love the music, although there is only one jump sound effect used by every character in the game and it is super repetative, and the levels are interesting enough if not a bit bland at times. over all, it's good."
"I like the premise, the parkour is fun but I think there could be more intensity in the pacing and obstacles, and better responsiveness in the controls. Actions have a small window to do, so it's easy to mess up (you'll either jump over, vault, or tumble on the obstacle depending on the timing). Same with tricks, which is ok but I noticed the tricks actually slow you down!! Lastly, my least favorite part is you soon have to memorize levels, which I think is unnatural if you were doing this irl."
"The game's concept is simple, yet the games mechanics are complicated. You need to be a little skilled to complete this game. I wished this game had a little bit more added to the soundtrack, but it doesn't bother me much. My only complaint is that sometimes the cubes are frustrating to collect. On Story 3-7, when you jump into the bridges hole, there is a part where you gotta climb 2 or 3 walls. There is a cube inbetween. As I try to pick it up, the cube refuses to be collected."
"It's a great game,I don't really like the controls and the reason why I gave it 4 star's is because,you need check points,I have rage quite soo many times,when you miss a move you have to start the whole level over again,So if you gave us check points and better controls I will give it five star's. Besides that it's a great game all-out,I like the concept,the animation,the story and sound affects,i'll recommend it to my friend if you give us check points in every level."
"Love the game!!! Animtion is smooth(and sometimes funny) but I give it a 4 stars because tbh, the controls are difficult. Ex: I swipe quickly to get running on the parts you need to sprint, but instead, it makes me slide, which is annoying or when I do sprint part again, near the end where I jump, it makes him skid to a halt and I die from stopping and fell of. Could you make controls easier?? If so, I'll give 5 start, thx"
"Edit: i have returned and they did fix the level. They seem to have taken a trick out because from the hunters perspective it wouldve been problematic, so if you could add a trick to an empty part of the map that would be nice. However, there's still some parts of the map that are bugged and it make it hard to traverse the map, but since I'm a veteran with this game I was able to manage with this, but I cant say the same for beginners."
"On Story 1-5, when you perform the backflip, it seemed that you cannot obtain the following cube below you. After you land, you can't hit it even if you jump as soon as possible. I know this may seem arbitrary, but if I play any level of any game imperfectly, it comes at the cost of my sanity. So please fix this trajectory issue, or explain to me how to get both the backflip completed and the cube obtained on 1-5. Also, make the game harder."
"I LOVE THIS GAME! Nothing wrong about. 1 tiny problem is that Vector will sometimes go through the floor, or he'll go through the wall and die. But it's no problem because it is very rare and honestly it just makes me laugh. I've beaten normal mode with 3 stars on every level. You guys have made a great parkour game. Actually, you've made the best parkour game. Edit: I still love this game. But now there is a glitch where I cant even choose the construction site or tech park. Please fix, thanks."
"I wish there was a way to adjust the sensitivity for the controls. You have to swipe perfectly in order for the character to move in the desired direction. Very frustrating when you are close to the finish line, swipe up to jump, but the game makes you slide instead, making you lose. Other than that a very quality game."
"Fantastic game, but why I gave it 4 stars was because the controls are pretty frustrating since you have to swipe in the STRAIGHTEST LINE for the boost. Also some parts I suddenly go super slow on. But I ALSO somehow clipped through the floor on the third level. I broke the glass but hit the edge of the floor and it decided to just clip me through the ground. Other than all this, the game is great!"
"It is overall a great game, with most of it being unlocked without having to purchase the deluxe. I'd give it 5 stars, but I do have one problem with it. I use an LG empire and this game runs smoothly until I pull a trick. That is when the graphics fail to comply with my screen and it freezes until a few seconds pass. My only problem."
"This game is very entertaining and I love it a lot..but...they need to make the inputs more simple to do. Too many times, I've swiped up to jump and it slides instead, or I swipe right to run and it jumps instead...or slides..that is suuuuuuper frustrating. You all need to change this, the dumb swipes only work 60% of the time. Everything else in this game is pretty great and I like it. I don't usually ever write reviews for apps..like ever. So please consider this one. Thank you."
"I like the story but never got past the tutorial because the dang gaurd was to fast! I would've kept playing it but it was almost impossible to get past the guard becuase I didn't jump in time, or I climbed to slow. If you want to make a tutorial to your game, make it progressively harder through the levels, and maybe make the tutorial easier. Then maybe I'll try to play it again. Great game though!"
"Very good game. Amazing graphics and cycle animations.. only complaint is that it is SUPER enraging that to get all three stars for each level, you have to time the jumps just right, or do something specific instead of jumping. Good game, amazing executions, but think about the amount of times one would repeat a level just to get all three stars... ugh"
It has the potential to be a top mobile game but loses traction due to poor controls on mobile. I like the control scheme but it has bad response at times. After playing a while I did get use to it and got better at performing special moves but I'd still like to see it improved. That aside it's still a great game with nice challenges that actually make you think and time your moves along with slick environments. I'd recommend it to anyone with a little patience with first time play.
"Not the best, but I'll give it to you, not the worst. So obviously there is sprinting and parkor and action, which, don't get wrong, I totally love! But then it gets to the point where it gets to easy (my opinion), mostly because you have to repeat the same level over and over again. Besides that, great execution, great backstory, good game!"
"Pretty much the best 2D parkour game I know on the app store. One small problem, SOMETIMES I'll do a action, for example: slide, but it'll do the opposite, jump. It doesn't completely ruin the experience, as it only occurs sometimes. Other than that I've been playing this game like crazy."
"I like this game, Awesome parkor and slick moves. You could call me decent at it well, I mean i have all 3 stars on each level. But it kind of has some flaws too. The window for the special moves is pretty small and some of the time i try to do them, I just jump. Amother problem is on the last level [level 11] at the seemingly end of the level There was a gap in wich there was no end of.I now see that this was only a little bit of the game and you have to pay money for the full version..."
"Uh.. regarding what Kade Pinion thinks.. I came here to write a NICE review, for I've been playing Vector for a month or so now. With about 33 challenging levels and obstacles, it keeps me entertained. Only downside is the movement--where slightly touching the screen can cause your character to perform an unintentional movement, sometimes messing you up. Aside from that this game deserves 4½ stars. I recomend. ( ads only appear every so often, maybe every 10/15 levels. I feel it's exceptional )"
Okay the game is awesome! I love the easy controls and how is it easy it is to maneuver. But I gotta say that some levels felt like they were impossible to get three stars with the way they were aligned. But also I was very disappointed with how the game ended on the final level In technology park. The game should have more missions and episodes and shouldn't be ending like a story. That's when I will give 5 stars but overall great game just go ahead and download it it's awesome. Be creative!!!!
"I think the game looks great, the black ground makes it really easy to see where you can walk and where you can't. But the movement feels a little slow, I would love to see that you can run faster, influence your jumps so if you hold longer you jump higher, so you can make little hops as well, and just other things that make it more fast-paced. I know, this is really realistic but for a game, I like that more. If you will make a sequel I would love to see that, I don't know if others agree."
"the game was good before, then you updated it.. before the update, it was very fun and the perfect amount of hard. Noe it's just too easy. And what's up with those glitches in hunter mode story 3-5 and 3-11??? You can't even complete the game because of that.. The bugs are funny and don't need to be fixed but those two glitches are unbareble..... Please fix that"
"very good game, wide variety of moves and interesting level design which makes replaying levels to 3 star and collect coins entertaining. however, my device's (pixel 7) sound stops working for this game after an ad is displayed and this doesn't occur with any other app."
I've had an amazing experience with the game so far. It's just that the majority of the levels in hunter mode (Technology park) just don't work. There's so many glitches and I can't complete the levels so could you try to fix that. Thanks.
geat game with a good concept though sometimes the controls register as different ones especially when accelerating but I can live with it. though I would like to see this adapted to consoles as a 3d version with button combos to perform moves and such
"Well, the game is very good all in all as the levels are quite entertaining and different but there's just one problem I have which is hunter mode as on levels 3 and 4 I have gone through collecting all the bonuses and all the tricks and not making any mistakes and I still cannot catch the NPC as he doesn't make any mistakes."
"Great game, simple but detailed controls with a good artstyle and animation. Jot 5 stars because when ads come up it cuts the audio and this is irritating as I'm forced to restart the app if I want audio."
"I really like this game, but I chose 4 stars, because I hate the concept on having points, but if you don't have the specific amount you can't pass the level and redo it again even if you finish the level."
"Game is awesome but still there is a big bug which makef the progress stopped. In hunter mode level 3.5 technology park, there is biggest bug and which not allow to complete the stage.make it clear please."
"This is a great game, I remember playing years ago and decided to re-play it. It was a good experience. But no 5 stars due to 2 levels in technology park that are completely bugged out, those being 3-5 and 3-11 (hunter mode)"
"I quite like it, it's fun and you feel like a parkour bad ass when you do well. That said, there are some parts of the level that tick me off. The most recent ones being in construction yard level 10. There's a glitch that happened around the final sprint where if you take the secret route where the bonuses are, the hunter will teleport ahead of you, guaranteeing your loss. Its annoying as hell cause I would have finished the level with three stars if it weren't for that."
"This game is more Awesome than what I expected!! One of the best game I've ever played!! The story plot, the animations, each ideas and obstacles for the levels are Incredible!! But there's seems like there's a bug? If you reached Story 1-4 (which is level 4), and the 'Hunter' is ahead of you at the part where you'll glide down to another building, the Hunter would disappear and appears a couple steps behind you, is it a bug or it's the way it is? Overall Great Game and would recommend it!! :D"
"This game is awesome, besides the occasional bugs (which don't really affect the gameplay that much, they're more just surprising visually) and ads. But it is free, though. One thing I'd like to say is that it requires a lot of trial and error. I have to keep restarting levels to try and find the right paths and moves to make. If the game had a story mode where there isn't a score, and you just have to beat the level to get the next, this game would be even better!"
"Now the nostalgia is strong with this game, and it's truly fun. However, while it does have it's flaws, there's one that sticks out the most. The one where you will want to turn the game off because you're replaying the same level for the 30th time, trying that pixel perfect jump for that sweet 100% completion rate. Other than that, solid game."
"It's a good game and all but I have this problem which I'm sure someone else is experiencing too where a couple of levels in technology Park hunter mode are quite literally impossible to complete, mainly the last one, which automatically puts you too far behind at the start. Other than that it's absolutely solid."
"I used to play this game a lot a couple years ago, I saw it recently and remembered how fun it was so I decided to download it again, but now the controls don't hardly work. Jump and slide both work fine but if I need to sprint and jump from building to building, when I need to jump I swipe up and my character slides to a stop before the ledge instead of jumping. I don't mix up my controls or swipe at an angle, I quite clearly swipe straight up on the screen."
Well i like the game it's so fun to play somethimes i rage quit but i gave it 4 stars bc the levels sometimes is impossible to get those square's it's kinda somezimes impossible to get them that is why I give it a four stars but it's amazing and i wold like a lot more add to this game it's really great and u hope there will be more adventures add more but i say download this game iz amazing
"In story 2-4 there's a bug at the finishing part where you have to climb the wall, for some reason either it considers it a long wall climb or simply way too far. Also sometimes in hunter mode the hunter instantly captures vector right at the start. These 2 bugs are an issue. Please fix it, other than that it's an amazing game."
"While the game itself is good, the controls are absolute trash. That IS exaggerating it, but not by a lot. Sometimes when you swipe up or right to jump or run, it SLIDES!? And the stunt/trick/whatever boxes are really finicky and hard to time it right. This is the type of game (at least for me) where you're like ""Wow, this is fun! *has a streak of bad luck* gAAAAH I HATE THIS GAME!.. alright, I'll try again."" and it loops."
"It's ok, I feel that the levels can be a little too long especially without checkpoints. But I highly recommend if you like parkour or a game that will take you a while."
"a great game, I remember playing this growing up and can't complain but being able to play it again is awesome. A lot harder than I remembered but just needed some adjustment 😄"
Hunter mode soft locks but as this being a goat of a mobile game one of the best it loses ita luster in the second game I've been playing this for forever so thank you for making this game but I would love to see more in the second game
I played the game in some years And i like the game there are more parts to play and a realastic grapics so this is a wonderful game to play.But the one option that i post this game four star and that is the skills.
I like it but on some of the games I think it is not fair that on some levels you only need two stars and on other levels you have to get three
I love this game...but there is a lot of glitches in hunter mode in 3-5 and 3-11 level pls fix it i love to play hunter mode but it can't be completed without fixing glitch please please 🥺 fix it nekki
"Nostagic game. However it requires some precised consecutive jumps to complete a level with 3 stars. Some stages are easy, some are really grindy. The game mechanics also force you sometimes for a perfect jump, meaning whether you touched the cube with your head, if your head doesn't touch a minimum area, the cube wouldn't be collected. There were levels where the momentum had to be almost inhumanly perfect. Extremely challenging and would not recommend it for easily demotivated perfectionists."
"The game is very interesting . One of the best. But then, it keeps erasing all my stats and taking me back to the first stage in downtown. I have been struggling with this. After accumulating stars , big coins and close to unlocking the technology park, it suddenly erased all my stats. This has been happening. This is why I had to give it just four stars...."
"I love the game! but the one flaw is that after every level there is an add, now I do know that this is the free version, but still! why after ""EVERY"" SINGLE LEVEL!? just make it like every two levels, thank you!"
"Great game. Playing this since i was a kid and downloading it again. Except for one thing. Everything great. The problem is not only with me but several other people too. When I try to sprint and swipe the screen, it reads as I want it to slide and thus I fell down or lose. Making the controls easier would be of great help Thanks :)"
"plot, sfx, bgm, and animation are all good. the intro is so well-done and the music gets you hyped up. why 4 stars tho? its not beginner friendly. this is the first time ive tried parkour games and even if im still in the first few levels im already having a hard time. the controls work fine for me, and the mess-ups ive made are caused by me and my fidgety hands alone. the one thing that makes this not beginner friendly is the map, because some parts are REALLY hard to navigate."
Great game and super addictive after many months of playing on and off... I'm on Hunter level 3-5 and it's broken! The correct route doesn't appear and the first lift doesn't work! Please fix!
"This game would be a 5 stars if there was an option for an endless mode after you finished all the in-game levels. Overall, fantastic game."
it is a really good game But it is hard + The bonuses are impossible to get But if you don't have any skill and dedication Which I don't have It will be hard like super super super super hard over all it is a nice game
"Now this game is not a bad game, it's well worth of your time with these cool parkour gameplay and animation. But the only issues is probably level progression as you need more stars to progress each level and the controls sometimes are just clunky. if I need more stars to progress each level then every level feels repetitive. Although in conclusion it's still a decent game"
"Ths game is awesome,this is my favourite Parkour game. But the reason why I have given this game 4 star if for one problem. The problem is to unlock next level you must be have a high level and to get one level is also hard it takes a lot of time. So, please fix that problem, if you fix that problem then I will be able to give 5 stars."
"This game is incredible!!! Though there is one problem. The slightest thing you missed you don't go to another mission instead you end up buying it(which can make the game less interesting). Also add more areas and weapons it would help a lot. So those that want to install it,install it,it's amazing you guys worked hard on it,(I was being honest and sincere). It's a game everyone will love♥."
The animations are impeccable but the controls are a bit tedious. Nonetheless great game :)
"This game is one of my favorite video games of all time. However, after coming back to this game, I noticed that some of the actions are very buggy, such as the sprinting, wall jump, etc. and never really respond anymore, which is annoying, so please look into the issue. Other than that, a fantastic game!"
"Great game, really tests your reaction timings. Occasionally the route is not as obvious and you have to figure it out which makes it interesting. Only problem I have with it is sometimes the run action is very sensitive to the direction you swipe, and sometimes end up sliding or jumping instead."
"There is a bug causing the game to freeze. It happens in hunter level 1-3 for some reason whenever I overlap with the one I'm chasing. Basically all I did was stay close to him as much as possible but when we both jump (obstacles before this are two water tanks) and raise ourselves at the same time we overlap and that is when the game freezes. Although it happened to me only twice so it is quite rare. However, can you make the zooming in and out fixed since that will help us see what is to come."
"Very fun and well optimised game. Only three settings but the hunter mode after getting 50 stars stretches it out a bit. A little grind is needed to get all the tricks which is probably to incentivise watching ads for money, but it's doable without watching them. Getting 3 stars on everything is a challenge, especially on hunter mode, and I think the game has enough of these challenges to keep it fresh. Play on airplane mode or you will get a lot of ads, but it's not as egregious as other games."
"Fun and fascinating game, but I must mention those variable cases that affect hugely in consequences; they literally occur from super tiny mistimed actions, and sometimes I don't even realize the difference of the timings. BTW, I'd love the game containing a few more settings: such as turning the vibration effect(which gets triggered when you are caught and electrified by the chaser) on/off, setting the strength of the vibration, etc."
"4/5. Great game, however they should either make it a trial mode instead of a story mode or ditch the requirements. It's a huge immersion breaker when you barely scrape by the guards to save your life and the adrenaline's pumping but the game makes you stop because you didn't do enough fancy tricks or collect enough boxes or you tripped on something a bit."
"I really like the game, it has cool graphics and realistic movements. The reason why I put 4 stars instead of 5 is because when the game allows me to run faster, i swipe right and it automatically makes me slide even though it tells you to swipe down to slide and I miss the jump. Please fix this😭"
It's a very good game but a few problems 1: I dont like the fact that you need to get enough of the cubes or whatever you need to get to the next level I haven't played this in a while so I forgot but anyways Sometimes I have to replay levels 10 times so I can get enough money to buy the next level 2: some of the cubes are really hard to get so please fix it Other than that it's a awesome game Cuz of the problems I'll put 4 stars If you fix the problems it would be a 5 star game for sure
"Professionally made. Really smooth and crisp game. Decent music. (although a little repetitive) Except the gameplay isn't a lot of fun. You don't really have a lot of freedom to run. I don't like the special tricks, and how you have to complete them all. Poor idea..."
"The game is really interesting. I love everything about except the fact that you have to buy levels. If i want to unlock a level, i have to coins which means i have to play previous levels which may become boring. I think they should work on the level buying. Other than that, everything is fine"
"The game is freaking awesome. Heart pumping actions with simple controls, which you will definitely love. (The game has crashing issues after some time. Please fix it). Don't play vector 2. It's horrible. Not part of the first game, no story, nobody chase you, no tension, no stress, terrible gameplay & and the menu is confusing & weird. You might regret vector 2."
I'm just wondering if you can fix the hunter 3-5 I can't get passed the part where you go in the part in the other 3-5 as vector every time to try and go in it blocks and does the running into a wall animation if you fix this glitch I'll be thanked also 3-4 hunter bonus 3-3 hunter bonus levels and fix the hunter story level 3-11
"Very good animations and solid game progression, but the gameplay tends to get reortitiv5"
"My previous review was just rage at not being good with the controls. This feels a lot like the computer game I played in study hall periods while I was in high school. The controls are better than I gave it credit for. My only real issue is the amount of ads and the games they advertise. There's an ad pretty much after every level once you get to level 4, and the games all seem to capitalize on this recent Ukraine-Russia conflict. Kind of in poor taste, don't you think?"
"fun game, cool graphics, very addictive partly due to the auto restart after you die. this game is all about beating the levels. losing a life takes you back to the beginning of the level until you finish the level. it's a good showcase of parkour which is fun to watch on YouTube and fun to play in Vector"
"I have liked this game and I love playing it, but there is just a problem. When I sprint sometimes, I either slide or slow down. Also, when I jump, I sometimes slide down. I dont know if I'm swiping down then up because I see that I perfectly swipe up. Maybe using buttons instead of swipe controls will totally help me a lot."
"Very creative! Very cool! I'm amazed at how smooth the parkour is. Well done, well built, my only reason for 4 stars over 5 is it's really challenging. I find myself playing levels 20 times to get 2 stars, often 30 times to get all 3 stars. Because of that I don't play it often"
"I loved this game, but now whenever I try to skip or go through the start cutscene, it freezes and then it closes. Please fix this bug because I have spent to long on this game to lose all this progress. Does it save even if you uninstall the game? Please respond soon, I really love this game"
It is a truly great game. The ads almost never pop up. There is one thing that I want though. I wish the game creators could make the game so that you can save progress across different phones and tablets. It would be a five star for this reason but because of this I gave it a four star rating.
Please add a VECTOR level editor. And why do people say there is a good story? It's just you jump from building to building then at level 11 you get saved by someone or run with them. It would be alot more engaging if you had another objective like carry that ball (that the parkour god in story 1-11 threw to you that HAD to be that important to give a stranger before he dies for it) to a base somewhere in a building with other survivors or escape the hunter when the place is compromied by huntrz
"I had a great experience overall, a fluent parkour game with good controls, but sometimes buggy. Sometimes when I get ahead of the hunter in some unexpected places, the game skips ahead on what I would do, or should by placing the hunter ahead into my place. Fixing this would be nice."
The game is incredibly fun with simple but pleasant graphics and amazing control. My 1 big problem is that there is no way to disable the stupidly uncomfortable and loud vibration everytime you fail/die. It is really annoying especially when playing at night. Can you atleast add a setting to disable that useless feature??
The games is simple with a good concept. There's a lot of skills to unlock and a lot of stuff to do the ads aren't out of control like a lot of games. Great for offline gaming. The only critique that I would have is sometimes it doesn't sense the action your trying to do but overall worth it I'd say.
"So I used to play this game a lot, and I just came back to it. It feels like it's all very slower than it used to be. The running looks very weird now, and even before, I had to watch many ads to keep up with the price of the tricks after the first area. Even when I was going for all 3 stars. And the levels become very trial and error later on."
You know what I am going to say. The controls are ridiculous when I swipe for acceleration it slides and when I want to jump it doesn't. So if you fix that it will be a great game. JUST fix the controls. First fix the acceleration part and others or Uninstalling the game will be only option for me.
"I love vector alot, and Nekki games too. I hardly play it, the game is good.. good graphics and Force blaster, cool. I wanted to uninstall it, but I was already in construction. I love this game, so I will go with four..but there is something with the controls, if going into a dash, I slide. so I'm not impressed."
"BUTTONS!!! PLEASE!!! THAT would get me to buy the real, instead of free, version. Any slight twitch of the finger brings kaos, anger and reruns of infinite measure! Especially when timed to the ~0.03 of a second to RUN , but ya-boy decides to take a nap with security-boy in tazing distance! at least in world 1 - 10 or 11 you have fast-boy to guide you through the nooks and crannies, if you can keep up with him. but overall I like this game and it handles very well with timing/ positioning😅"
"We can experience the Parkour just by swiping. Background music is so awesome to listen. It's perfect for a quick run and chase. New levels keeps us going but later it gets boring as other games. Yes, we get new stunts after each level but still the common factors make it ruined. Still liked the gameplay and storyline."
"I had a lot of fun playing Vector, for so much I rate this game 4 stars Why, Well from the hard parkour challenges, and intense music, I haven't had the time to buy the full copy, but for the experience, I had seen, this game Is a 4 stars review, later down the road, I can see buying this game, if Vector wants a 5 star review, then I believe they should make this game for the Nintendo switch, it would be a great experience for the Nintendo switch, or someone should make a port for the ps vita"
"I like this game and is excellent. I did not give it 5 star because it had a lot of bugs in it. But in level 3-7 it was very hard during the looping if he wasn't on the screen behind me, he would teleport in front me which was very annoying. Other than that the game was good 👍."
"I mean its aight but umm well its super hard to get coins and the coins thats 100 its spawns randomly, and its almost impossible to dodge the taze attacks can you at least ad a 3 second timer until the taze pls. (btw thats reson i gave it 4 stars). ""new complaint"" make the map on 3-2 the part when you see the [slow spin] move its almost impossible to use the slow spin skill after the roll so pls change it the platform to be lower or place the skill more farther than the roll"
"RECOMMEND FOR WHO LIKES PARKOUR: Okay it's awesome come back from the game because it's nostalgic, nice tricks, easy to play just 1 finger, 3 maps which is cons, and there's 2 modes, a Classic (Vector Dude) and a Hunter (Which you have to chase the Vector one). The Hunter mode is little bit okay cause of the bugs so it's good nice game."
"The game is so cool I noticed the position of the character when it's resting is similar to shadow fight 2. The technology park stage looks outstanding, I really wish you can add more gadgets than the force blaster though. The hunter mode is nice. But in my opinion I prefer vector than vector 2"
"This game, although high quality and very enjoyable, easily crashes. When from 15-20 minutes, Vector just stops running. Also, the movements are a little bit too sensitive, but overall, great game."
"Well, I love Vector, I love the parkour-inspired action and the cool moves. I also love the graphics. The only problem I have in the game is spending the coins on moves and getting three stars in all levels, but I love the game. Keep up the good work."
"The game is great and all but the little squares that you need to collect sometimes annoy me, there hit box is so small that if you don't get the jump or slide with great timing you miss it, please fix that or maybe just make the hit box a little bigger."
"The game is fun and all but the purchasable moves get to expensive through out the level's, Either I would have to play the level's and get more coins, or I play other games for the perks they offer, And both take too much time, all I'm saying is that the game is fun but the moves get pretty expensive."
"I love all the parkour moves included in here, and they're all spot on with the actions....but the controls make it almost unplayable >:( I could be trying to run faster, but then I'd slide or jump, letting the guard catch up to me"
It's an amazing game with lots of parkour moves and also gives you the experience of a running game. This game is one of my personal favourites but many of the tricks have to be unlocked with money and after sometime you end up with no money at all.
"I love this game. It's AMAZING! You have plenty of stuff to do. But the thing is, even though the ""slender"" problem is going down. Alot of online dater shows up and it is really disgusting. Also there is way more glitches and mobile. When I am sometimes walking with the thumbstick it makes my screen go up instead of moving forward. Sometimes when I play a game it either: 1: takes me out of the game and back to the loading screen and never loads 2:Glitches me and disconnects me when I have WiFi."
"Pretty fun most times. On chromebook, it has issues. Thats why its mostly fun. I cant chat without being frozen for like a minute. Additionally, when i chat, the screen flashes black. The game has lots of good parts though. I have made several friends and Im able to play with all my friends in a variety of games. There is language and sometimes WEIRD content. It has all type of games for everyone. Overall, 4/5. Good game, needs to be fixed on chromebook"
"There is a problem in the game that is making me think four stars! When your playing whatever game you wwnt to play and stuff, it will glitch and freeze the go back to normal for a few minutes then i just disconnect and I'm hating it because then if I don't have the people qs a friend... I just miss out and it makes me so mad! Otherwise the game is pretty good and I would rate it fours stars! If this ever gets fixed I will be so happy. One more thing, sometimes it won't let me load into Roblox!!"
"This game is wondrful, but there are some problem. First, the shift lock doesn't work. Second, I can't go into games that have too many graphics, such as ""Warrior Cats Ultimate Edition,"" And I would have to get into my private server to be able to play, which sucks. Third, whenever you chat, the game will freeze you after enter your chat, but that isn't really a problem to me only because I figured out that you have to press enter.Fourth, it doesn't allow me to click on stuff in full screen."
"LOVE THIS GAME!!! But, however, there are a couple things I'd like to talk about. 1st, when I try to join games like Wild Horse Islands, or Warrior Cats, it takes forever to load and I of course get impatient, and leave. I used to be able to play the games, and some of my friends can, but I can't. 2nd, I don't like how the camera acts all weird and when I try to move the joystick, it moves the camera too, and when I try to move the camera, it zooms in and out. Other that that, amazing game. :)"
"Great game overall, but since the last couple updates i havent been able to play my favorite games. Also, theres this bug on mobile devices that dont let me move the screen, I can still go left, right, forwards, and backwards but the screen wont move so i cant see where im going most of the time. Besides that though, its a great game with lots to do."
"App is ok, because it works only a bit. The app started to say there's ""no internet connection"" when there is, when I play for some time. The update i gotten at Feb 11 2023 seemed to break the app for me. I use 4G LTE. Thanks ahead of time for checking if the app is faster for devices less than 3 GB Ram or not. Although, the graphics depend on the device you are using. And it's free. I can't just stop playing this forever! It's that great!"
"This is quite a good game! But honestly, I had to give it a four. Why? There is an annoying glitch on mobile, if you accidently go into the menu, your screen either goes up when you walk and just goes the opposite direction. Even if you select the option ""inverted screen"". It won't go away! The second glitch is when your screen just stays in one direction when you try to move your screen. No matter what you do it never get fixed. But overall, Such a great game!! It's very fun :))))"
"Honestly a pretty good game, almost no complaints. One thing I've noticed though; in the games that are car-based, the vehicle physics just feel weird, like the handling on the cars is stiff like an RC car, or they're lighter than they should be. Especially if you hit a jump, it seems like the car doesn't stay in the air as long as it should, like the gravity just feels a little off. If possible, maybe try making the cars handle smoother or make them weigh a bit more to handle more accurately."
"It's pretty good! Many different styles of games, horror, Roleplay, survival, battle, tycoon, ect. One thing is the sensoring. Say I want to type ""Ramen takes 32 hours to digest"" (which it actually does), it will sensor out the number 32. It even sensors out word form of the most random numbers! It nags on me alot, and the sensoring is probably something that makes me rage."
"Great game. One issue big enough to drop the game to 4 stars in my eyes though. There is a camera glitch that sometimes pops up in the middle of a game that completely stops you from moving your camera. If you try it like normal, the camera sporadically moves in and out instead of turning. In almost all cases you must leave the game and rejoin to fix it (except in games where there are screen transitions, that will fix it too.) It's only on mobile however. Still a great game, don't get me wrong."
"This game can be good at some points in time, but this game is closing down I could say atleast every 2 months. This game is really fun as well! Your get to create avatars, play millions of games, make friends, and so on! But it also includes lots of glitches like when I move my character, sometimes it only shows the characters feet and I can't move the screen. Sometimes I can't leave the game! And also items unequip when you put them on sometimes! I found out how to fix the feet glitch! Update"
"This game is amazing, tons of fun also, but there's one major problem that brings this rating to 4 stars. There's a mobile glitch, where you are unable to move your screen, when you try to move it, it only zooms in or out. The only way to fix this is by leaving the game. This can make playing frustrating, and difficult. Please fix this. Overall, the game is awesome!"
"It's a really good game. Although, past 10pm it won't work and I can't seem to figure out why. Just to get into the game I have to close the app and reopen it multiple times, and when trying to get into a game I'll have to click join multiple times. Not to mention once I'm in the game, it won't load anything(My avatar, the map, animations, ect.). But besides this issue, the game is really good!"
"Great game, but would love to see some type of chromebook/chrome monitor support. I play on a chrome monitor, so I have a keyboard and mouse, but a lot of features are unavailable like shift lock switch, which is pretty annoying considering I have a keyboard. I also have problems with lag, and can usually only play most games on graphics setting 1 or 2 (really bad gfx.) However, not considering the chromebook problems, it is a great game and would reccomend."
Overall this game is my favorite. But there are a few reasons why it's 4/10 instead of 5/5. It's really laggy on chromebook. It doesn't let you scroll down which is annoying to me. Sometimes when I chat it tints the screen white/grey. In some games when I try to chat the screen freezes and doesn't go back to normal. And overall it's just laggy.
"Don't get me wrong. Roblox is great. But sometimes it will kick me out for no reason and/or disconnect when my connection is at its highest point. It seems like many people also have this issue. For example, when I'm just having a good time talking to my friends on Roblox, it would disconnect (or kick) me or my friends, whoever comes first. This issue is quite annoying because when we try to join in the same server again, most servers are full, and it's irritating. Hope it's fixed soon! Thanks😁"
"I think this game is amazing and i would really recommend downloading it! But tbe one little thing is the oof sound, it sounds like someone is sneasing🤣 I really really miss the old oof sound but There's another problem. When I join a game it some times has a screen glitch Where I can't move and can only zoom in and out, the only way to fix it is by leaving. Overall Great game!"
"It's an amazing game, but there is some glitches. Like how it makes you unable to move your camera at certain times. Also, idk if you're reading this, but this is to the person who said they should make all games for mobile. Roblox doesn't control that, the developers do. Also most games are only for PC because only PC can take the amount of graphics without crashing."
"It's a good game it has fun stuff but the only problem is that on some older devices (like ones from 2007) it will just crash or lag like crazy like in doors, bloxburg, and etc. Also even if you can play it's still kinda bad because sometimes your screen will glitch so you can only zoom or you just can't move your camera. I'm guessing that the first screen problem (the zoom only glitch) will happen if you move your screen and zoom at the same time but it's still a great game for PC"
"Overall it's a great game. I just have one little tiff... the jump button's too small. I'm trying to play an obny and I keep missing the jump button when I'm supposed to jump and losing, and since I get mad easily, it's very frustrating. If you can fix this problem I will gladly update it to 5 stars. Overall amazing game. 😎👍👍👍🫶"
"I've been playing 5 years and it's an amazing game! ALTHOUGH... there's one thing I suggest adding. While changing a display user, you should add ""are you sure you wanna continue"" Because one time I was changing my display and I made a mistake and accidentally clicked save. I was a bit frustrated.Also, probably a year ago, I had trouble logging in my account. The user and password was most definitely correct but every time clicked ""log in"", It kept on saying ""wrong user/password."" Overall great."
I love the game very much but sometimes it has some bugs like when I'm playing a game the screen will freeze completely and I have the leave and rejoin. Another time is when I get a screen glitch while I'm playing on my iPad then I have no way to fix it. But it's a wonderful game and they keep improving on it!
"It's pretty good especially for it's mobile compatibility but it's got some game breaking bugs like not being able to zoom out or move the camera if you accidentally get it stuck while moving the camera which is super frustrating and easy to accidentally do, that and the cost of of robux is absurd, it also suffers from really poor moderation which end up hurting the experience more than the good it's supposed to bring. but besides from that it's a relatively good experience! 3/2 out of 5 stars."
"Probably the best game I've ever played. Millions of free games and you can create avatars, design games, and play with friends. The game does need internet though. The only bugs are is sometimes it kicks you from games out of nowhere. Also when I'm on Android, I will go to log in and my screen turns gray or black and stays like that and it takes forever to fix. Pls fix this but otherwise great game!"
"this is a great game, just on chromebook there are problems. for example, sometimes it might kick you out of a game for no reason. and plus, on the home page, you cant even scroll down. and that goes for games too, unless they have a button on the screen that you control with manually. its also hard to control if you have shift lock on. and theres also things that you can do on mobile that you cant do on chrombook while playing roblox. other than those few problems, great game. very fun."
"I really love this game, but i have 1 problem. Thats why i rated it a 4. So for example I'm playing an obby, and i fall, I'm not meaning to fall the problem is after I put my finger off of the walk button then sometimes it'll make me continue walking when my finger isn't on the walk button. But this is pretty common for me now, but it is really annoying. There is another problem that some people are saying which is easy to fix. Just tap the button at the top left then tap it again or tap resume!"
"Great game. Really fun. Only issues: False reports, people actually breaking the rules don't get a warning, temporary ban, etc., and the fact the most harmless words ever are tagged. For example: ""Red"". The amount of times a color gets tagged is crazy. Edit: Breaks on Chromebook. Every time I type something, it stops me from moving, only able to turn the camera. Fix this please."
"I love the app but sometimes very laggy, there are games that when you leave your screen freezes and you have to leave the game and rejoin. Or sometimes you join a game and your avatar doesn't load, or the game you joined is horribly glitched. For example: half of the game can dissappear or you fall through walls/floors. Or the game freezes and nobody is movinng. It is very rare for these glitches to happen but overall very fun and good entertainment."
"I love this app and the gameplay, but when it comes to Chromebooks, it's nearly impossible to play. When I try to log in to a game on my Chromebook, there is extreme lag and i cant even play anything without getting kicked out or waiting for forever to load in then get kicked out. Again I love this app but I hope that they make it more easier to play for Chromebook players."
"Don't get me wrong, it's an amazing game, but it has a lot of problems. For example: when I'm on mobile and an update needs to be installed, it always says that I can't. I have to completely uninstall and reinstall the app. A suggestion is that roblox should make an update where you could select multiple friends at once and unfriend them all at the same time. It's frustrating having to always unfriend others to friend another. Please take it into consideration."
"It's overall a great game! There is a lot more bugs and lagginies then some games, but considering it's a multipleplayer game with over millions of players it's not that bad. There are many types of multiple player games with people across the world, or just friends. There is also a freinds list and a in game/out of game chat as well as multiple ways to customize your profile and avatar. You do have to use real money to buy robux for even simple passes and avatar items which is annoying."
"Great game, loveee it! Just one small problem. I hate it when the screen just freezes. Like you try to move it then it zooms in/out, or it doesn't move at all. It happens all the time! Only way to fix it is to leave and rejoin. or if there is a cutscene it fixes it for u! Please try to fix it? it gets super annoying."
"This is a very good game. No ads...well you can make an ad for your games. OH you can also make games and play multiple games. But I do have one issue. Whenever I play on mobile, it's either always laggy or the screen freezes with no reason. Not sure if this is just me. I mean I'm not blaming Roblox for this but at least fix the problem with the screen freezing for 40 seconds."
"Awesome game. Theres calm games to play when im sick, horror games to play when im bored, and action games to play with friends. There's a few problems though. One is that sometimes I buy something with a bunch of robux, but then it deletes it. Please fix that. Another, when im on a call with my friends, my screen keeps going black, and then when it's on again, either it completely messes up the movements, or freezes my game, both causing me to waste another 5 minutes getting into the game."
"This platform has really nice experiences. However, there are a few bugs present. For example, There is a camera zoom glitch (It can be fixed by changing the camera settings, but is really annoying in fast-paced experiences like arsenal, piggy, Mm2, etc) . The pink screen of death is getting pretty frequent now as well. The most annoying part of this is that it randomly kicks you due to too many players playing. Moderation could be better. It really lets you express creativity which is nice."
"This is a very nice game 🎮 but some times it lags when you are in the middle of a game. For example it can't allow you to enter mega mansion tycoon and some other games.when I take a day or two it can't allow me in the game itself. have tried deleting the app and installing it again and even updating but no difference, but my WiFi is very stable and don't disturb.Please find a way to fix my case."
"this app is really great, a lot of variety of games you can play but there is just one problem that I hope will be fixed soon. Earlier today, I have verified my age and got the new feature ""Voice Chat"" but when I decided to try it out, the mic was NOT working. It was just a grey mic. I could not enable it. I decided that maybe I should just wait in-game a little longer but all that happened was an error pop up on the mic it says that there were problems connecting the microphone to something."
"Very good game.its controls are easy,the graphics are good, the variety of customisation for players............. BUT, there is a problem where sometimes the screen and controls glitch, cause when I turn my screen it can't turn,it only moves with the direction I'm walking to. It could be because I'm using a mobile but I don't know..... PLEASE 🥺🥺 fix this I will be grateful.🥺🥺😁😀😃😄"
"I LOVE this app ,there are soo many games to choose but sometimes there are some glitches where you can only zoom in and out , also the cars seem a little weird handling the car with one thumb and it might take a few minutes to keep it in control for new users , and I hate that it takes A LOT of network or wifi . But over all this is an awesome app. And it also deserves a 4 star review! So download it!"
"It's a great game! So many different games that are great! The reason I gave 4 stars is I have a camera problem, I play on phone. Whenever I press the menu button in any game by accident, my camera glitches. It won't let me turn my screen, It'll only let me zoom in and out whenever I try, and I'd have to rejoin, which is super annoying. If you can fix this, please do!"
"This is amazing! it does get laggy some times,over-all it's a great game! Robux is a problem but it's fine really! Just a request tho to maybe make the private servers free and also when I try to accept a friend request it won't let me but it's only in few games so I guess it's really fine but please fix this bug thank you! I will be sure to update it once it gets fixed! It's a great game!! I love it!!! and I'm sure others think the same!!! I'm sure it will get big in the future! All the best!!☆"
"I love this but I also hate it when it asks for an upgrade when i just upgraded it, and the lags it always give me. For example, whenever i log into the game, it would kick me out for no reasons. Another: it would lag randomly and pause and it would only zoom in and out when i try to move(on phone). And sometimes when I'm going to check my inventory in a game, it wouldn't open ny inventory. Theres more but I'm lazy so...Anyways, I'd love roblox if yall fix this big, please. Thx and yeah"
"If you want to play multiple games in one app, Roblox is the best choice. I love this app because it's add free. And we can also play and make games. We can chat with friends while playing games. This makes our experience fun and enjoyable. And one problem is whenever I am changing avatar, most of the games it shows my characters not wearing clothes. I really want you to fix it. Thank You for understanding."
"There'd only some few problems, first problem is the lag, it makes the it hard to play (expecially on mobile), second problem only happens on mobile, the camera bug thing where then go click the Roblox icon and resume playing you can move the camera, you can only walk and jump, it's very annoying and I hope you fix that problem, it's been like that since forever and please fix it. Overall this is a nice game to play with your friends, plus it have A LOT of games you can choose and play."
"I love this game because there are so many games that u can play and you can have more friends or you can play with your friends even they are far, I just hate the bug like for example my screen is freezing and sometimes I can't touch my screen. I would like to recommend more free items for those player that don't have money to buy robux. This game deserve 5 stars but i will give this 4 because there's a glitch:>"
"Ayooo the game is astonishing! The graphics were good, the gameplay was not too bad 😁 and it wasn't lagging at all! But why'd I rate it 4, not 5? The progress was good so far and I loved it. It's because when my connection was not good when I was playing, it gave me two options whether I reconnect or exit. If I managed to reconnect, it started the game back and my progress was missing. So I encourage u to fix this ok? 👍"
"For me, Roblox is a perfect game for me. The reason I write 4 stars is because the game use a lot of internet (depends on the map) and my school has BIG internet issues. It'll be great if it doesn't use much internet. Edit: for some reason the rendering just randomly sucks. It happened yesterday, it only rendered 10 meters of water from the camera. It's very ugly now. Fix it pls. 2nd edit: Thanks a lot for fixing the rendering issue it's so much better now. Thanks!"
"The game is really good, so many games to choose from and they are so fun. Now, for the PC version everything works nice and all but for the mobile version not so well. On mobile, some games barely manage to be playable and there is this camera glitch that only lets you zoom in and out. The glitch is very annoying and if Im playing a game that doesn't save then I lose everything because I have to rejoin. Another problem that I found was that you can't really make the camera stop following you."
"This is a marvellous game with a variety of games to choose. From adventure to horror to role play there is something for everyone! However, recently, because of the updates from roblox, I can't actually play the game without updating it and the updates sometimes dont work at all, but it could be the play stores fault, and, in game play, I sometimes will be stuck and not be able to move, even if my internet connection is working fine. Overall, great game."
"It's very fun, but it does have some issues. The lag is horrible. Absolutely horrible. I have to go to the wifi thing in my house just to stop some of it. The friend request is annoying too. Because its on top of jump, I keep pressing accept instead of jump. When I was playing an obby and almost made it, a friend request and I fell. Thanks ""Unicorn_lover12345"" but that's all that's wrong. Other then those two things the game is great and fun and entertaining."
"This game is amazing, it's my childhood and after 6 years I'm coming back to play more. There really isn't anything bad about this game, except for a bug on mobile. It's a bug when I try to rotate my camera it zooms in and out instead, I have to leave the game and return which is very annoying especially on games where you start from the beggining."
"It's an amazing platform where you can meet friends (and play with them) and also have fun on different the games it's has to offer. Although it may glitch sometimes and you can't login, it does get fixed. Also the have many different categories of games to enjoy and play. Like horror,roleplay,comedy and more. I definitely recommend trying it out. Also games do get updates so there's always something new. It's also great for teaching certain skills(doesn't apply to all of the games). Enjoy!!!!!!"
I love roblox but sometimes it sends me off and is really laggy most of the time and the buttons don't seem to work. When I'm trying to play it is extremely annoying as it happens every 5 minutes. Sometimes it freezes and goes all blury. I don't know why it keeps happening but I'm definitely not complaining. I would definitely recommend this.🥰😍😘
"Its an great game! It has many games to play and you can make new friends. And I like the new update where we can get the robux from the deleted items we bought before. But, theres too many bugs. In my laptop, I haven't experienced any bugs. But in mobile, the camera gets bugged without a reason. It only moves upward and downward. And I neeed to rejoin to fix it. Please fix it because I cant play properly and I'm sure other people experienced it too. Theres more bugs so please fix it if you can."
"I personally feel this is a incredibly fun game and totally original, but it does have its faults, such as the games such as "" Club Iris "" and "" Adopt me "" or "" MeepCity "" which, depending on the people in the server, can be very inappropriate, but there is also the child friendly games. Then there is the occasional bugs, like when you're playing mobile ( atleast from experience) you're screen will glitch and not be able to move. Other than those faults, this is a very entertaining game."
"This game is really fun, You can play games with your friends or, find friends in games. There's obbies, Tycoons, Horror and more! But, when I play some of those games, there's always someone who wants to be friends with me. But, I don't really pay attention to friends when I'm paying attention to the game. So, can you make the friend request on the top? The mobile players have to click the screen so we'll accidentally click on the request. Thanks! 😃👍"
Roblox is a great and fun platform especially if u play it with friends (preferably on a call) however sometimes I get a screen glitch where it zooms in and out whenever I try to rotate the camera or it will just be stuck. I hope that gets fixed bc it's so annoying. I have to rejoin games again and all my progress/coins that I earn in that round/game can't be saved so I lose all of it. Other than that it's pretty good.
"My kids love this game, but they told me to add bugs and things in the Google reviews. 1. Whenever they play a game, the screen freezes and teleports them back to the home screen. 2. When they are playing a game, the joystick moves the screen up and down. 3. In a game, the screen freezes and it only zooms in and out instead of left and right. David Basucki, (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) please fix these bugs. Also the bugs only happens in a tablet and phone."
"i think that its awesome that you can play with friends, and theres a bunch of options of types of games to play. But the on thing that annoys me is that every time I play this game on my computer, it always starts glitching out, and then decides to kick me out of the app. Idk if its my computer that cant handle the game, but honstly thats the only thing that really bothers me with the game."
"In Roblox, I personally don't think its a good game for chromebook users. For example, you can't use / to type, you can't get shiftlock and you sometimes have the mechanics on a phone or Ipad. It's also super laggy. Overall, Roblox is still a really fun game to play and I suggest that others should play it aswell. It has many games to explore and you can communicate with others. Since you can make friends, it's way more fun cause you can also chat to them!"
"I love this game! It's very unique and fun. It's multiple games in one game. I'd rather play this game for 24 hrs! But I have a few problems with the game but it doesn't happen all the time but I'm still saying. The reason why I gave this 4 stars is because it lags on mobile. For example, whenever I turn the screen left/right, it just zooms in/out. It also makes my screen freeze that I have to restart my whole tablet or delete it and download it again. Please, please fix this problem. Ty."
This game is amazing when it's not laging and loading slowly it has amazing games but I have been hacked twice so they need better security and currently I can not log into my account it says username/password is invalid when I know for a fact that it's correct and I have the safety lock on it so I automatically log in but it won't work and I don't know why.. Overall the games are good and have fun things to do!!
"Very good game, but I would've rated it 5 stars if this was never occured. The reason why I have 4 stars through this app is bc sometimes it has a glitch through the screen for mobile players. I can't move the screen at all, It only zooms in and out, Please fix this , I'll change it to a 5. Although, Another reason. The app has certain games to play with , and some of the games won't let u in , it'll just kick you out of the app.(This only usually happens on my ipad) But it's still a great game!"
"There are some problems to this game, but still is a fun and entertaining game. Very fun to play with if bored and it is also a multiplayer game! I love it. There's just one problem for me, when ever I press the roblox icon, my camera always freezes! I can still walk though, but please fix it, I think it's only for mobile players for this issue to happen. Either way, it's still a fun game. I also recommend for you to add a feature that let's you make games for free. I don't have enough money."
"The game is great, pretty cool, interesting games, but there are Oders, bugs, sometimes you get disconnected for no reason, and there are times where it just breaks down completely. Overall there is some things you could fix. Sometimes the chat breaks down, in that case you have to server hop a lot of times, so yeah."
"This game is an awsome experience, you can never get bored exept for if you don't try something new. If you like fantasy, horror, reality or shows, you will adore this app. Although the sometimes laggy times, this game is perfect for you. It will crash a few times, but I have it 1-3 times per YEAR. Overall, I really recommend this : you can do anything you wish, if there is a game you cannot find of your dream. Make it!"
It's a really good game it has so much games but I would rate it five but it glitches. When I try to play a game on there it won't let me play it this might be a problem with Android phone's and the next time I tryed to play the game it would not work to the point where I had to install it it would just send me to the home screen
It's a good game but there are many slight problems 1st is (I'm in mobile) and sometimes when I play a game(in roblox) it suddenly quits on its own 2nd is I can't control my screen sometimes and it just zooms out and in and it forces me to quit or reset when I'm in a middle of a game and all my hard work will be gone(or something) that's all I could think so pls fix these problems.
"It is an amazing game. But some time it has glitches or bugs, example : players that use mobile sometimes can't move, And when your camera freeze and you can't do anything, also this bug when your phone fall or something the camera is fine but when you move, the camera goes up/down. But others are fine. And Im going to say this one more time, it's an amazing game"
"Good but fix some bugs. There's a glitch that when you accidently click the logo on the game and resume. Your screen will freeze. I think it only works on mobile. And i hate it when you have to update or upgrade the game like every month i think.. It's getting annoying and sad, because i can't play with my friends and i need to remove apps to update, Thank you for you're understanding🙂"
"Amazing. It's the best game in the world! you can play with real people and friends, and its epic because you can play lots of games in one. I would give it 1000,000000000,000/10!so many different games. My faves are minerscave and meepcity 😆🥰❤ But lately, people avatars are appearing bald in some games. I dont know if this is a crash or bug, but I'd be happy if could fix."
This game is amazing! I can get behind the fact that most games can't be supported by a mobile device but they're is one that has bugged me out ever since I discovered this. Mobile users can only hold 3 items in the main inventory while everyone else can hold up to 10. Just why? Very annoying and confusing but only a minority in the many problems that have rose over the years. 7/10 would recommend but some things just don't make sense. Keep up the good work!
"It is a great game with lots of features, including good graphics and fun multiplayer interactive qualities. The reason I am giving a for is because the game will often get very glichy, freeze, and sometimes shut down. Overall, this is a good way of passing time and exploring the different things Roblox provides. I recommend!"
"I don't know if this problem ever happened to anyone, but in a period of time, (not regularly) my games kept freezing for no apparently reason. I can't move my screen, etc... Like it's all of the sudden?... But then it went back to normal. It happened prob more than twice (in a certain games I played). Also, this problem even last for a week or more. Which is weird bcuz my Internet connection is stable? I thought refreshing the home page might fix this problem, but it didn't work."
The best game ever and I love it because I can play with friends and you can friend people and chat to them and there is lots of games to play and enjoy and even math games for learning and you can customise your avatar in any way shape or form. and this is why it is 4 stars it sometimes glitches and gives you some error codes But overall it's a great game
"The concept of the game is pretty cool. People can make games, and ay them. It's also a good game to play with your friends. The game made a bad first impression for some reason. Most people think it's bad for the wrong reasons. The main problems I have with this game is how slow it is. You have to re-open the game multiple times, then restart you device. It gets annoying. And the updates. So many updates. But over all, it's a pretty cool game, with a cool concept. Four stars."
"The experience I'd say... AMAZING! This app never makes you bored as there are numerous ways to be entertained by others, you can meet a variety of different people; servers being made and then published which are what adds all the existing content of fun! This application offers a lot to choose from which is optional. But one issue to be reported which is very recent: I was playing with a friend and we decided to go play some other game, we left and then roblox said retry! This dance went on..."
"I love this game but its too much data taking and expensive to use also I just hate that sometimes when I try moving my screen it just zooms in and out of my avatar , overall quite amazing . a lot if games to choose from . Some games ain't easy to understand but others are easy to understand and are amazing"
"I mean, hey, let's be honest. It is a good game, but the violation of rules that people break just really gets onto my nerves, even games deleted that made good memories with my friends, though. See, I know that it has to be following the TOS, but there is one game that just needs to come back. If so, that will be World of Countryballs. I really miss that game a lot. I bet there were many protests, but overall, Roblox is alright. Please bring back that game and any memories the players have got."
"I am playing it for 2 years now and I must say It's very cool game. There is practically everything free and that is what's the best about it. But there are also the called ""slenders"" or online daters who make the game worse. I'm not saying all ""slenders"" are bad but most of them are. I recommend this game but you must prepare for some good and some worse people. Enjoy!"
"The game is awesome! But there are a few problems...First there are bugs. Second sometimes when I play a game, let's say...Doors it gets really laggy and my loading screen takes forever o to load. Other than that this game is awesome! A"
"Roblox is super amazing. It has many diffrent varieties of games that kids, teenagers and adults have a good time playing it. Although unlike around the 2018 it has been less enjoyful recently. It's not because it's hard to play,but the series of games are quite the same. Around the 2018 it was very enjoyful and interesting that you have motive to try out other games too. But it's still fun if you play it with friends. So I highly recommend this app if you're in to discover new things!"
"I love playing this game so much! But there's some problems to fix. First and the most is when the screen glitches. (Only mobile players) sometimes when I turn the screen left or right it zoom in / out. Also sometimes when I walk it turn the screen up or down by the opposite control direction. Oh yeah, also avoid the dirty ppl who asks to do dirty things. But yeah, at the bright side roblox is on the top least of fun games, I really enjoyed playing roblox these years!"
"Theres so much games. It sometimes lag. It sometimes pay to win. It got a little less fun. It's not the worst, instead i like some simulator or tycoons. It requires internet, but it's still great so it's pretty good. (I like how in 2022 I said ""ITS THE BEST GAME"" and now I'm like ""it's pretty good"" in 2023)Also theres a couple hackers it's a little annoying so four stars will have to do."
"It's really fun and can play a lot of games inside, but sometimes it just lag.....like I can't go into Roblox but my friend literally can just go in without anything AT ALL. So a bit frustrating but rest of the part actually really good, so yeah. By the way my favourite game is Adopt Me, go and check out that game. It's really, really fun! Because you can hatch pets and have pets! That's all for now, Thank You for reading my text. Bye!"
Honestly this is a great game on my personal opinion. But why four stars?1: firstly I play on mobile meaning there is more lag like if I'm playing a game and I try to go forward and the screen goes up instead2:if I start walking and the screen it like stays in one direction and can only Chang the direction with the joy stick there way more bugs and they should fix it for mobile players. Overall that it is a good game. But Roblox should consider mobile users.
"Well, I got to say this is one of the best games in the entire universe but, normally it glitches and kicks me out of the game and sometimes for the touch screen, when your walking your trying to go straight but your screen goes up and it's really annoying but still, it's the best game in the world. Anyone would have to give it a 5 star rating of how good it is. Best of luck everybody looking at this and if your about to download this, I need to tell you something, ITS SO FUN!!!! :))))))))"
"I give it 4 starts since I've been playing this for 2 years and it is going great. The dance animations, everything! It's great! Also sometimes lags and bugs r there and j get disconnected too often even tho my internet doesn't have connection problem. Sometimes what happened is when I try to fix my screen like move my view and it just zooms in and out and it's only sometimes. The rest is O kaay"
First of all roblox is a wonderful game and it has many great features and people but I'm here about the avatar shop. Ever since the layered 3d clothing has been added I have not been able to get the classic clothing on pc or phone and I'm getting frustrated and It only shows a couple items when I'm shopping like 8 of each category. This is quite the disaster and it's getting old so please consider fixing the issues I'm not sure if anyone has had this glitch but none of my friends seem to glitch
"So uh once i was trying to talk to someone, and it said that i was offline, and they could not see anything i said. I had to go into a game to fix it. Another problem I've noticed is if you dont touch the screen for a while, it wont let you move, and to fix it, you have to go into the menu. Other than that its a very good game!"
Amazing app just in certain games there is lag and/or bugs or glitches and some games you can't play and sometimes even freeze your phone! so it's kind of glitchy but just fix it and I will be happy 😊 so yeah just fix it but other than that I really really really really really like it if you don't like games that glitch I don't recommend it but if you don't mind then I recommend it 😁
"roblox has a lot of fun games to play and I like how it is free to play. although it's very laggy on mobile, some times it just freezes for a bit and other times it just full on kicks me out of the app. it's a really great game platform but it just needs a few changes with mobile games. it would be great if roblox could make you be able to change the layout of the buttons on mobile, keyboards are getting more compact therefore it's easier for keyboard users to move around unlike mobile users."
"Very good game, but although when I move the thumbstick forward, it moves the screen forward. Second of all, it locks the screen and I cannot move the screen HALF the time. But very great game, although I wish this environment will fix bugs."
"Roblox is the best game I ever played, We can change avatars, play some games, and even make friends and this game doesn't have any ads. But the reason that I have four stars is when I join a game like Brookhaven, Then it glitches my camera and doesn't let me move anymore, and to fix it I gotta rejoin, This is the most annoying thing in the game. please fix it. Please I beg you to fix this"
"Fun! But is very laggy. Roblox is a good game because of how much games there are! There is a bug that needs to be fixed ASAP. For example, when you try to look around, it makes you zoom in its very annoying! Overall, amazing game! 😄"
"This game is AMAZING and so fun,I don't really have much to say but there are some bugs in the game like if you're in mobile sometimes your screen may freeze and sometimes it just moves randomly and it's just annoying,but the game is still so fun I recommend you to play it if you love adventure and also it has lots of games,and there is also one thing that robux needs money so please make robux for free and thank you."
AMAZING!! An amazing game love it so much. I love the games and changing my avatar. I play it with my friends all the time. Also I like that they have the button where you can change your profile emote but for some reason mine doesn't have it so if you could add that on it that would be amazing. Love the game so much!
"Well, the game is good and the upgrades are making easy but I wish I could play this game offline as well because I always go somewhere and when I play somewhere else it usually takes up some of my data which makes me pay lots. And if robux was cheaper I would get it instantly, because I live in the PH, so dollars are really expensive but not only make it cheap for my country but for all countries and some how make a discount for premium. Thanks for the understanding."
"I absolutely love this game! I've been playing it ever since I was 5-6! But I do have one issue! My profile picture just isn't working for some reason,I've tries restarting,uninstalling and getting back on my account or even seeing if it needs an update! Please fix this !"
"Really enjoy playing this game as much as my other games.One of the only things that's badis the waiting for crops to be grown, products to be made, and factories and homes to finish building. I understand that the developers are trying to be realistic, but sometimes fun and just playing the game in general should be prioritized over that. Also another thing that is a bit annoying, is that I wish there were more ways to obtain items to construct buildings. Ex: includes glass, brick, nails, etc."
"Overall, I really like the main game. I just wish they'd stop adding so many different mini games that have nothing to do with filling orders and competing on the different boards. It's frustrating to get on the app at the end of the day and just want to do a couple ""farm"" tasks, but first you HAVE to go through these steps of this mini game that you have ZERO option of skipping the tutorials on, and will likely never go back to play, once they finally release you to get back to the main game."
"Amazing, Fun, and addictive! Everything you need for a great game with in-app purchases that aren't needed. I wish I could give 4.5 stars! Only issues are the mini games... The only thing nowadays is the matching games that I now find impossible to beat, with a ""hard"" or ""super hard"" level among a little amount of ""easy"" ones. If we could get some of the old ones, such as the car one, or the bubblegum one, then I might be more engaged with playing them. That's really my only issue with the game!"
"The base game is great. You're not required to spend money to level up. It'd be faster sure, but you won't feel left behind if you don't. However, in the mini games, if you're not paying you're just stuck. The ""hard"" and ""super hard"" levels are ridiculous. And sometimes even with the power-ups the game just gives you an unwinnable match. Multiple resets and the like. I get they need that money, but if anything makes me stop playing this game, it'll be that. Still 4 out of 5 stars"
Been playing for months and am still obsessed with this game. Only downside I have at all is that I can't remodel my town anymore because the screen shifts to the complete other side of where I'm trying to place items and I am not about to struggle to move every single item across the whole map. I need to make room for more buildings but the materials to expand land do not come often. Rest of the game has been fantastic.
"love the game, it keeps you pretty busy. the reason for only 4 stars is because it takes forever to accumulate cash. i wish there was an easier way to get it faster. I'm not one to put real money into a game, so this is driving me crazy to get 1,2,3... dollars here and there. Also wish there was a little red mark above the friends icon to let you know when your friends need help. I find myself having to click on it every little while just to see if anyone needs help. And the mini games suck."
"This game is fun! The graphics are engaging and the game play is easy. A great game to play for 20 minutes and come back to. This game brings back memories of Farmville. There is one thing. The barn storage is limited, which is fine, but when I have big helicopter orders it makes it difficult. I wish we could fill parts of each helicopter order like we do with the trains. That would help immensely! I wouldn't have to delete crops I spent time growing just to fit in 25 cotton in my barn"
"Game is a lot of fun. It progresses at a good pace without making you feel like you have to play 100% of the day. The pay to progress options are very apparent but thankfully you are able to succeed in the game without buying anything. Update note Why was the ""home"" button in the bottom right removed? It was in a very convenient location and was a lot more usable than the ""back"" arrow you put in to replace it!"
I like the game. But 4 out of 5 of your display photos (and the video) focus on a mini game that is maybe 15 seconds long and pops up once a week. There's only 1 photo that actually shows the game you play the other 97% of the time. Seems weird to only advertise such a tiny piece of the game... it also seems weird that the mini game that's so heavily focused on is so short and infrequent. At least make it pop up every day if that's supposed to be the whole game. 🤷
"takes way too long to regenerate items & the game forces you to 'Pay to win'... if you don't pay, you cannot upgrade/build most buildings, including the storehouse and everything takes 1hr+ to regenerate... I literally have to set everything up, go do something else and come back after an hour or so, so I can keep progressing..."
"The mini game is ok, but the hard level and the super hard level suck all the fun out. They get you to spend all your money you had made and also all the bosters you have, then you run out of lives on top of that. And you're stuck on the one level for a week you come back and play, and it lets you win. It just takes the fun away. Thats why I dropped the rating. Construction materials suck too. You get 3 times on 2 items and 0 on the other. And it ties up way too much barn space."
"This game is WAY TOO ADDICTIVE! Wish it was easier to build plots to grow crops--too many restrictions. If you try to keep pace with the speed & dictates of the town population, it can bury you quickly. And Way to Easy to accidently use Township money--perhaps add a validation ""yes I want do this"" option would be appreciated. The cash disappeared & had no clue how! Ended up having to delete everything & start over because of all the above. Overall, Yes, I'm enjoying it. 4 out of 5."
"Love some parts of the game. Very frustrated w/others. New garage sale is very disappointing. Too many steps to make progress even w/ purchases and playing often. Really wanted the exotic greenhouse. Pls provide another way to complete the central garden. Other sugg: *Tool exchange should allow input for what need and what have *Tile games go on way too long (20 days then repeat too soon) & include too many hard and superhard. This is supposed to be fun, but frustrating too much of the time."
"I really enjoy this game! There are only a few things that are driving me crazy right now though. The piggy bank 1/2 off cash should be an option if you want to buy your cash not forced, bring back the home button when visiting, players should be able to request the amount of an item they need instead of relying on the algorithm , and in Regatta when a task is completed please bring back the check mark on the outside of the ship."
"I love playing this game, I love how detailed everything is and that I don't have to watch an ad every two seconds to play or pay to have a good time. But I do miss the Christmas decorations very much and I don't like the mini games they've had going on for a while. There used to be quite a variety in the mini games, but now they basically alternate between two games that are basically the same thing. I miss the chicken roller coaster game and the sheep jumping game and the gumball machine game."
"The tutorial is very helpful in helping you getting started in building your township town. Each item unlock at the corresponding level after you finish completing the task without any problems. One setback is that their isn't enough of the material coming from train to finish building the building to fully get it unlocked and open. Although a great feature is the ability to join a group when it is open to you, as you can get some items need to complete task along side the market."
Fun to play when passing time. I like that you get to build your own roads and decorate however you wish. I also like the real animal sounds ECT... But the puzzle games seem almost rigged into making you have to spend real cash to win. I don't like that but overall I rate about 4 out of 5 stars simply because it is a good game without ads to play for fun.
"The game is cute. I love the graphics. They have mini games within the game for events However, those mini games are repeating. They used to have different games but now they are repeating the same ones and it's the worse ones which are the snowboarding and rollercoaster and the explorer.THOSE ARE SO BORING and infuriating!! BRING BACK RESTAURANT! Enough of the explorer game! The dorky guy is annoying and he glitches all the time. Like his face is scrambled"
This game is really good but when it comes to specific parts I just quit. But I also am looking at the picture description to this game and none of it looks like what the game offers. I've downloaded this game multiple times in the past just becsuse I thought it would be fun and ended up deleting it because of how long it takes to level up and for the crops to grow and for how long it takes for the trains to come back.
The game is fun and you can play for a long time before running out of things to do. My 5 and 6 year old like it too. I just hate how impossible many of the games are because it's obviously they want you to spend the dollars you ha e collected and then eventually get so frustrated you have to spend your own money to progress and get the game prizes. It's about every 4 or 5 games are impossible to beat in the first set of turns.
This is a very fun game. So much to do!! Love it all!! But i do have 1 thing that upsets me.. im on lvl 1000+ with the match 3 games.. i have come across the extremely hard lvls that make it impossible to finish the minigame it has us doing.. like now.. im 4 to 6 things away from beating the game w 2 days left to finish and im stuck on a very hard lvl and i refuse to spend more money. Make them a little easier or give us more moves on the extra hard lvls But other than that its a great game. :)
"The updates are often, but require a lot of space. It's only a time consuming and very straightforward game that takes all your attention, frustrating and fun. The downside is these mini games that are continuous and required to do the ""Golden Ticket"" games. Too frequent, and annoying."
"I've been enjoying the game for years now. I love it and play it every day. The only thing that bugs me is that during regatta, it doesn't show me the task status (for example, # of picks I used / I need to use) on the right side anymore. This is so annoying because I need to constantly check the regatta tab to know how many more I need to complete the task. Please fix this."
"It's a buildable farm town. Create it as you go. There are cute options to customize, and you level up. It is slow paced but fun. There are fun mini games. IMO, it is adult and kid friendly. Cons: can't bypass ""update recommended"". Had it for three years, and lost it (I didn't save it, but I think you can)-after downloading this time, have noticed some of the glitches others have mentioned. Nothing too bothersome."
"I like the game very much but there is a problem it randomly shuts off and now it's frozen on a screen where it qualified me for some prizes and when I tap to receive it shuts down, very frustrating. Just wondering if there is a fix for this I have tried restarting with no avail and I am afraid to uninstall for fear I'll lose the game and have to start completely over! Please help if possible. Thanks!"
"This game is very fun, addictive, and user-friendly... to a point. After a while, the game becomes too intense with too many goals to meet and things to do. Boat races, painted block events, planes, trains, mining, collecting artifacts, and way too many factories and friends to keep up with. While I understand that games are intended to become more challenging over time, this ultimately is what made me stop wanting to play this game."
"Not what I expected. The ad that got me to download the app consisted of you solving problems in a town. For example choosing the right tools to fix a bridge or a plow in a barn. The actual app is nothing like that. However, it is fun to play. Not many ads to deal with so that's nice. The time to make certain items are a bit unbalanced but that's to be expected in an app like this."
"This is a fun game to play. But over time it just gets repetitive and boring. The ads are extremly misleading. They make it seen like a puzzle/choice game when its really a building game. You build you town (which takes an extremly long time). The items needing built cost WAY to much. The objectives for airplanes, helicopters, and the trains pile up and you get stuck with tons of items you dont know what to do with. It's fun for a few months but then it just gets boring. Good game tho I guess..."
"It's a pretty fun game. I go through waves of playing and not playing. I once left it for over a year and when I went back, everything was just as I'd left it, waiting for me. They've made some great improvements & while progress can be kinda slow if you don't spend money (and it's hella expensive if you DO buy the game's cash & coins) it's still decent. I do wish there was a way to cancel things in progress. I've bumped my screen & started things I didn't want but couldn't cancel. :("
"I really enjoy this game and the graphic are great! It is highly addicting. My only complaint is some tasks take too much time and then instead of being exciting to come back to, it becomes monotonous. For example, they should ask you which goods you want in the train rather than randomly supplying you with things you don't need. I have 6 buildings waiting to be built, because I have receive the same tools everytime."
"I really enjoy the game. The main fault I have is that they have an event ticket that costs $4.99. Originally you could do a bunch of different quests to try to win the reward. I loved that way. Currently the ticket is tied into mini games. You have to complete quests in mini games to progress, if you mess up it costs the premium currency to continue the level. The ticket is not worth the money if it is tied to the mini games. If it is just quests it it totally worth it."
"This app is great, you can join clans, send off ships, trains, and planes. But you have to work up to certain levels to unlock those things, which gives you motive to continue working on the game. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star is because sometimes it glitches and I can't get in, or it glitches when I am in the middle of doing a minigame. Also when I try to move the helicopter pad, it increases in size and takes up my whole screen, so I can't see where I am moving it to"
"I hate the zoo. I wish we could totally opt out of it, it feels like a clunky add on the enclosures suck up materials and the vistors want too much. I never help anyone with zoo requests. I hate that I have to be in a club for the regattas. Most aren't friendly or helpful. Besides that I have never had an issue with lag or freezing. It runs phenomenal. You don't have to pay a cent to play or advance, I love that so I always DO spend for the experiments and bucks. The graphics are INCREDIBLE."
Great game so far. Only complaint is it takes way too many tools to finish buildings and zoo enclosures. It takes too long to finish these items. The train does not bring enough of these items in my opinion. Also maybe letting the market man (whatever he is) fetch these items would be something to include in the game. I spend a little money trying to move ahead but I can't do it much more. Just can't afford it. Other than that I play every day.
I love this game so much. But... It got slow once I hit level 21 getting coins is super easy but takes a lot of time. It's hard to find building supplies and things to expand the land with. Shovels.. etc. Wish it was a lot faster and easier. I love the co-op of the game. Definitely makes the game with playing. Never can get tired of it for sure but it's not a daily player. It gets boring if you pay it continuously because of how hard it is to find materials. You just patiently wait unless you want to spend money on it. Not my forte.. but overall a great game. I hope they change it soon.
"Great graphics, colors, attention to details and was fun at first but costs too much real money, and items take waaaay too long to finish, such as buildings, properties, factory articles, and ships. We should be paid at least 1 green dollar for mortgages on all the buildings, houses, and businesses we have built that sit around doing nothing. The barn is a nightmare! So sick of up grading! With as many upgrades as I have done I should have at least 3 giant barns with 3x's the capacity. Maybe we could have a roadside farm stand and all those people wandering around town could buy from us, at market price. The only reason I am still playing is because of the Halloween Haunted House and the mine. Without those, I would be bored waiting for everything else. Thank you for a beautiful game, with just a few flaws, in my opinion."
I LOVE this game because it reminds me of RollerCoaster Tycoon. I get to create and build with someone elses money. I think the price for things is way too steep. And the time limits are also way too long...a little wait I can understand but I think it is excessive. I have many buildings still under construction due to no materials and the last 10 trains havent had them and I cannot afford to buy them. I watch all of the ad's but never can finish. Fun though!
"I like this game I do play often, however I feel it takes too long to build and expand on the town and zoo. I don't like how expensive things are as far as buildings and enclosures go, and waiting for materials from the trains to expand your land and barn takes too long. I feel stuck and it's annoying. I used to sit and play for hours but it's beginning to feel like a pick and choose game rather than for leisure and fun. The regattas are nice, the factories take a while to make some materials"
"Sim game, like many others. Very nice graphics. But it is very difficult to get materials for building. playrix tries to force you paying up for play money. This kind of mentality is short of robbery. The higher the level you get to, the longer it takes to get the materials to upgrade or complete a building. The constant ads for buying cash are VERY ANNOYING! The constant upgrades and special events are a very appreciated feature, keeps the game interesting."
I love the game. Been playing it longer than any other I have played but it is very difficult and expensive to expand your town. It takes FOREVER to accumulate the necessary tools to complete a building in both the town and the zoo and the cost of just starting a build gets higher and higher as you progress in levels. I love participating in the regattas and the graphics are awesome!
"Really enjoy this game! I have a stressful job and it helps reduce my stress level. One thing I'd like is to be able to get 2 hammers, buckets of paint, etc in the mini games. Also in sheeplechase and others when you start winning a lot of runs in a row it switches and speeds up so you can't win for a while. It also does that when you win lots of hearts as a prize. This makes the mini games frustrating."
"Game isn't pay to play and requires teamwork. building your town adds to the play, but the whole layout is awesome. addictive, but allows you to get to the point of putting your phone down and nit missing out. The events sometimes cost to much cash is my main problem. however, the interface and shortcuts all make sense and the game easier to play."
"I'm in agreement with Blair! I love this game! Been playing for 3 years! But all I get now is glitches, crashes and wipeouts of what I could get accomplished. I can't play in the regattas at all anymore. Also, bought the golden ticket but can't complete the tasks because of the crashes! Very frustrating! Been going on for over a week now! Please FIX ASAP!"
The game is easy enough. I just wish there were better explanations about what the rewards were for when I first received them. I cant tell you how many I sold. Overall it is a good way to pass the time. October 2020: they gave us a new upgrade which went hand in hand with the 7th year anniversary of Township. This upgrade has slowed the game tremendously for some and has prevented others from being able to log in. I am thinking it might be time to quit this game.
"Hate the puzzle mini game I've been playing for a little while, and like most everything in the game except the puzzle/match game. It's very difficult to get through, not enough moves, and too overwhelming at times, and they last too long. I'd like to see maybe a mini bubble shooter game or something similar. I enjoy the roller coaster, arcade style, sheep run, and the gum ball mini games. I even enjoy the little mini one you can do where you get your orders for the deliveries by helicopter."
"I really, really love this game. But on the negative side I don't like how the higher you get in levels the more expensive the new items cost. Some things take way too many hours to complete, the expansions cost way too much, the trains don't usually bring the goods you actually need, and I dont like how long it takes the dealer to rest when you have spent your tcash to use him. Overall the game is addicting and fun. I just have those small complaints."
"I like the game in general. Seems like the higher level you get the more difficult they make it to keep moving forward. You need more and more material to build things which takes forever to collect. Then they require you to get tools which you have to trade the same material for to get. Again a ridiculous quantity that takes avery long time to get. I refuse to spend real money on a ""free"" game. In addition this latest update has caused the game to be slow and glitchy."
"This game is really addictive and I love it. it challenges you to really think through things as you are seeing up your town. Items to produce are timed, crops and factories are timed... ..it really makes you think and prepare. however the are times when the server goes down and you cannot access the game, which I don't experience with any other games, that is frustrating."
"Love the game. The pace is not obtrusive in my life. The one thing I would like to see is improved ability to chat with other players - both in my co-op and in other towns. I would like to be able to comment on someone's town. The ""like"" system seems useless to me. I would also like to see better rewards for Consistently finishing in the top 3 in regatta. I do Love all the events and mini games. Good work!"
"I have played this game for 4 Years! I rated it 5 stars the first 2 years and then 2 stars after a totally messed up update. Those problems have been corrected. I now rate it 4 stars! It has a lot of in game items that cost money, but with no commercials within app, that is expected! I am a little disappointed that it appears they may be eliminated the championship corporate race. It is the most popular mini game on my team."
"The game is very fun. I've seen some other reviews about the update but I havent seen any issues. My only complaint is one mini game, the roller coaster chicken one. It hardly registers when you slide your finger up or down to match the track. So when it doesnt register you fall off and fail. I always skip this mini game, which is a bummer cause its 2-3 days long. Wish they'd take this one out and bring a better one."
"I enjoy playing the game, for the most part. It is fun and challenging. What I DON'T enjoy about the game is the frequency of ""timing out"" of regatta tasks hours before they are due to expire; the length of time it takes to amass construction materials to build community buildings and zoo enclosures; and constantly running out of space in the barn to store products because so much of it is taken up with huge amounts of construction materials. We need a separate storage place for them!"
"Love the game. There are definitely improvements needed. Like rotating buildings 360, being able to store buildings so you can redesign your town, converting coins to cash & vice versa, being able to sell excess goods to other players, I have many more ideas for improvements as well. I also agree with other reviewers that it takes too long to get building materials, I have several uncompleted buildings due to this."
"I love the game, but there are downside to the operations. It takes forever to gain enough cash to use once you level up without spending money. And you do not get enough building materials that you need via train. I will always have too much of one but not enough in the other. Plus the prices to purchase stuff get more expensive as you level up after level up and it gets Reddickulas. Over all great game. Just be prepared for this aspect of horrible game play."
"Very enjoyable! Building a town, producing goods and competing in games is great! The 2 negatives so far is the annoying length of time products take to produce and occasionally money and products just vanish! This needs to be fixed! Would love to see another longer event that has an opportunity to get bonus rewards at the beginning that last throughout the length of the month!!!"
"I love playing but the construction materials are getting to expensive, I don't mind spending a little here and there on a game (which I have spent a lot) I like because it helps the developer. Right now if I wanted to complete my buildings I have to wait for trains a lot of trains or spend $80-$90 to complete my buildings that's just to much money for a game. Ridiculous would give five star if could be cheaper."
"Sometimes have connection issues, sometimes the game doesn't work properly and I have to uninstall and reinstall. Definitely not my phone or connection. Also, takes too long for stuff to build and some things cost too much. But I love the game!! Especially love the special events, but wish they lasted longer."
"I really enjoy this game, its a great way to get your mind off things for a little while. Although, it does take a long time between trains, boats and planes if it had less wait time i think id enjoy it more. I also wish the building supplies were available to buy with the coins, i contantly feel behind when advancing to the next level because i cant get the supplies ro complete buildings or expand my land to build the next available community building, factory or decorations. I love the game!"
"I love this game! I first ran into it at the beginning of quarantine....my what a way to keep busy! So many levels to keep you interested. The graphics are amazing! I set timers to come back and harvest my farm, send things on the plane or recieve packages by the train🤣 I am so hooked. One suggestion - is there a way to have the game give you a bird's eye view of the town? As I expand, it gets harder to see everything. It will be great to for everything on one screen even if in edit mode."
Constant entertainment. I keep waiting for the pop ups and the 'need' to buy several items to make the game play more fun but even though there are options there is enough to do and keep you busy that you don't feel pressured to do more to keep playing. I love the little characters and how they have roles to play in MY city that I can recreate and expand. It is best to take small breaks so items can be made. I wouldn't mind them being built a little faster but it keeps me in check from vegging!
A game that anyone would love!!! Very creative! I have been playing it for about a year now and it's been the most amazing and fascinating experience! But here are some downs... takes a lot of space in my phone... It always needs internet and I.. I can understand about the co-op and in app purchases but we should be able to play offline... Last is that my game never gets mini games which is very sad😧 But.. overall perfect!!!!!!
"It's a wonderful game. I love playing the game. the biggest problem I have with it, is the barn always being full. that drives me insane. I'm close to deleting it for that reason. Building materials take way tup long to accumulate to upgrade. They're should be a separate building to hold your building materials. that would help a lot for freeing up room. Thank you."
"Love the game! Too bad the buildings can't turn 360°, when searching in any of the construction hat items, wish there was a back to beginning button and most importantly, when in orders from the helicopter, wish I would be asked if I'm sure if I want to delete this order if I hit the trash button. I've accidentally hit the trash button twice and oops there goes that order! Other than that, lots of fun!"
"This is an excelent family game. It would be better if they put the building that turned your bricks into gold coins back in the game. This is a ""free game"" so I shouldnt have to buy more coins to play. The new way to ""exchange"" tools for building makes the gane harder and takes up to much time to build things. It eas long and hard enough before the change. The regattas could be easier and refresh sooner. This game can be relaxing."
"I love this game! I have a lot of time and money tied up in it. I don't like the way things are now at the zoo! It took a long time before to get everything needed for completing construction, but now it is ridiculous! I've got 5 animal lots waiting for materials! For 2 weeks I've had animals being held because their pens aren't finished. I need materials in town too! Really?! A game stops being fun when it takes weeks to make progress!! Please rethink this new way of expanding buildings! Ty! 🤔"
"This game is great so far. Ive been playing for about a week and its so addictive. I love the small details like watching the people go about the town and engage with one another. Update - I'm removing a star from my review. I hate the zoo feature. It's already difficult filling orders for the train, plane, and helicopter to now have to fill orders for the zoo. Im trying to avoid this part of the game, and thankfully it doesnt seem to have too much of an interference with moving my town along."
Addicting game especially for time management OCDers. Updates seem to take an unusually long time which can hinder players from getting ahead in competitions. The barn fills up quickly a lot which is frustrating considering the number of news items introduced at each level. But overall fun game and like the ability to interact with others in the Co-op.
"I like that I don't have to spend money on playing this game like other 'farm games'. I also like the teamwork that is necessary in this game and the independent control of the teams. I really dislike that I can't insert corrections in the chat, that I have to erase all the words back to correct another word. This really slows down chat. Also ""help/tech' is pretty useless. Whenever I've needed help, the help has been slow to respond and the problems were never taken care of properly."
"A very fun, addictive game. Good for passing time! Eventually, you will need to make in-app purchases to advance easier in the game. Every other month or so, they do The Professor's Experiment event. In order to get 2x the bonuses and extra perks in the game, you will need to make a $5.00 purchase. Some players just want to level up. Others try to get every decoration for their Town. Pick a regatta team and get in game help/make some friends. Very detailed, interactive graphics!"
"💜 There is a lot to do to keep busy while building your town & it's event's are fun. My Co-op is awesome, I like the social part of the game, it's very interactive. The one thing that keeps me from not rating this game at 5 stars is that it can take quite a bit of time to collect materials needed to finish construction on buildings, to expand land & to upgrade your barn. I don't want it to be too easy, but not so hard that it keeps me from enjoying the game further."
"Super fun! Can not stop playing! Love it! It does get a little slower and ""harder"" around level 40 cuz things get more complicated to make and do so they want you to spend real money to speed things up, and if you don't, you just wait longer for things to happen and advance in the game. Made me start playing anther game but i still play this one at least twice a day."
Update: I still like the game but it is getting boring. I have a really hard time leveling up in the challenges and the regatta does not give enough 135 point tasks for the whole team to do. I am just bummed because I use to get excited for a new experiment and I even paid the $5 for the gold pass. Not anymore it is to hard and I pay money to barley earn anything cool. I like the challenges and the concept...takes way to long to upgrade and to collect enough materials to build.
"Great, but expensive! I love everything about this game, beautiful graphics, very entertaining and good learning... But you can't go any far without spending LOTS! of real money. The barn gets full quickly and every upgrade costs a lot of money and barely expands a little bit. The game demands a lot of upgrades to this barn and every building, so be ready to spend a lot of real money."
"this is a fun game if you join a good co-op, but there are far too many events that involve real money (you can spend to win), and the game has been built so that unless you're willing to spend real dollars, the storage versus town building versus zoo building just becomes frustrating at higher levels. their algorithm makes it so challenging it is more frustrating than fun 90% of the time...unless you want to spend money. it's better than a lot of free game apps, though. lots better."
"I absolutely love the graphics! In my opinion, Playrix never disappoints In regard to the attention to detail. In this particular app the simulation of the towns citizens is so realistic, I just love the creativity of this app. However, I would like to make metion that the levels are absolutely too complicated to pass early on in the game. It seems that the levels are set up for failure to force you to purchase more moves and special bombs on every level after level 4. It's very tedious."
"It's a fun time waster. I enjoy watching my town grow, collecting crops, playing the semi-competitive mini games. It's not necessary to spend actual cash on the game to have a full experience. I've experienced very little glitches. Sometimes the mini-games are pretty impossible to complete in a timely manner unless you're constantly on your phone. Enjoy!"
"I really enjoy the game. I would give 5 stars but I find it very annoying there are no ways to cancel or stop ships or factories if they are waiting in line but already ordered. You can't speed anything up without ""town cash"" and you can't earn enough to make much of a difference, unless you pay real money for it. But mostly it is fun and interactive."
"So I love the game, it's a great way to make the time go by. My only problem is much of the time I will create items such as sheets, cupcakes etc. Collect them then they won't show up in my inventory. l've restarted the game and my phone many times. I have lost so many times and it makes it that much more difficult to play and further myself within the game. Again great game and it's free to play so no complaints there, I just hope this glitch can be fixed."
"Fun game and doesn't force u to pay-to-play to advance. My only complaint is the special events, I easily win 1st place in every type.... except snowboarding events. Snowboarding event is slow to load and the lag causes me to crash almost every run, then it wants $3 tcash to make up for the slow loading crashes or lose. I don't really bother with trying to win that one anymore as it's impossible for me. Maybe it's my phone but every other event runs smooth so I doubt it. Pls fix snowboard race"
"Fun game, lot of down time waiting for item productions. The missing star for my rating is because they refuse to allow the option to cancel ANYTHING once it's been started (no cancel button, no undo button) . Something about possible cheating & exploitation causing an unfair advantage if there were an undo. But if everyone has it then it's not unfair or cheating. But really, there just need to be a CANCEL button, like when a field gets accidentally sewn, or we need to change a factory""s queue."
I love this game very much... The only thing I would have a problem with is that y'all try way too hard to make us spend our own money.. and why do we need parts to build our other buildings like nails bricks and paint? Not going to be spending my own money finishing them... And another thing some items take way too long to build over 12 hours for some buildings really. It is a good game though. Very addicting but needs some upgrades on the stuff I mentioned above
"My absolute favorite game. It's fun, engaging and colorful. However, some of its major issues cause me to dislike the game. 1. It costs TOO MUCH money/materials to expand. I keep a tidy town, and waiting for materials and money to expand, forces me to jumble items making my town look messy. 2. Having to wait for the trains to arrive takes too long. 3. It's very hard to earn money. I won't to into detail for each bullet point. Overall a solid game, but could use improving in these areas."
Love playing the game but levels are too hard to reach and makes you want to stop playing. I'm having issues with the latest contest because my screen blacks out whenever I click on the truck to start. I can see the leader board and how many points I have but I'm unable to continue this is disappointing. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game with no success.
"This is surprisingly very fun and yes you do play a few games that is advertised. I don't bother playing the event games with the match 3 Challenges though. They make it very impossible for you to finish it, giving you a very limited amount of moves to work with unless you keep buying more moves, which I refuse to do. Quite disappointing, but overall, the rest of the game is fun."
"First off, ads are optional. It's a fun game at first but after awhile it is very time consuming. Orders take longer to make, as expected. Money slowly builds up. They run events right after one ends, which is cool. You can interact with other people's farms, help them out, etc. Getting the parts to build buildings takes the most time, in my opinion."
I love this game and have been playing for a couple of years. The only thing I have a real problem with is the ads. I know it's needed and I don't mind clicking on them when they work. A lot of times they don't load properly and I don't get the reward which is a waste of time. Also those 2 and 3 part ads where you watch 15-30 second at a time before having to click and continue for another 15-20 seconds are just annoying. Get rid of them and go back to the traditional ads.
"A lot of fun, but there's one big problem. The barn. It is really bothersome when you are trying to collect crops or animal products and you simply can't. It interrupts everything and makes it frustrating to play. I would sell my goods to free up some room, but I've realized that that method is not very profitable. Maybe you could make the beginning storage 100 instead of 50. That would definitely help. Other than that, it's a fun city builder (although not super realistic)."
"I want to give this game five stars. I don't even mind purchasing currency from time to time. The issue for me is that the mini games are sometimes too hard and it hinders progress in some of the larger events. Specifically, I loathe the sheep game. The concept is adorable but it's too fast. I basically ignore the sheep and the roller coaster mini games while they're up. Bummer."
"Have been playing for a long time, still enjoyable but getting frustrated with the challenges, having to do a ton of match puzzles for the building/decorating ones and STILL not be able to finish is annoying. The mini games are great, but getting repetative. There are several we haven't seen for months: cooking, fruit slicing, snowboard, among them. I have enjoyed building my town and helping my co-op for several years now, and hopefully will continue to do so!"
"Great game! Just need to change the factory production option to start making as soon as box is filled. Waiting for an hour for a snack is frustrating. Also, an option to change the items in belt line. Unlimited friends would be a great feature to have, gives us more opportunity to invite people to play!"
"Fun and addictive game. Love the ability to chat with a co-OP. However, it takes way too long to be able to expand your territory which results in a sloppy looking town as there is not enough room to design an attractive town. Building supplies take up too much room in the barn and need their own storage space (like the mine). Overall, fun and addictive as stated."
"I do love the game- I play it every day. The frustrating part is the limited amount of building materials you receive making completion of buildings to improve your town takes way too long! I do like all the different moving parts (growing items, making things in the factories, helping friends/group members, filling the plane, trains and orders) a lot of fun and addictive."
"I had a wonderful experience with this game until a couple days ago when there was a request to download the update. It is a continuous spinning with ""pending"". I was at level 84 and had a very nice growing community. SO FRUSTRATING to get so far into a game while enjoying the daily challenges to not be able to upgrade/download updates at this stage. I feel this is a slap in the face! I tried uninstalling the reinstalling with still the same issue. Has nothing to do with my internet."
"Like this game a lot, although it moves very slow as far as progress is concerned. Wish collecting coins and cash was faster. I don't know if that changes as your level progresses, for now I've figured just produce certain crops and trees and sell them to make quick money although that doesn't help much when trying to complete development of buildings which need certain materials, which come every blue moon. But nonetheless, i enjoy this game. Also amazed at the detail when viewing your town."
"This game is addicting for sure. For a while I'd rearrange my town whenever I was board. Now it's too expensive to expand very often & it take upwards of 3 days for the land to be ready. Also, the materials needed to finish buildings increases in number with every building, so now I have to wait months to gain enough material to finish between the town and the zoo. The mini games are fun but they take away most points earned in the events if you ""die"", lame!! Puzzles are few & far between."
I enjoy the game but when you have an issue there is zero resolution. I am trying to play Mysteries of the Old Park. I have over 5000 energies but the buttons to clear the path have disappeared. So they have cost me the chance to win the rewards and prizes. I only keep playing for the Seaside resort prizes. I have uninstalled a reinstalled 5 times. Doesn't work. Put in 3 tickets with the support option and no contact or correction. I've played this game for years but may have to give it up.
"I really like the building the farm aspect of the game. However, I am really sad that the mini games to earn extra stuff are the same and then you have to pay for the really cool upgrades. Wish you earn them in the mini games instead of buying and then still having to bbn play to earn them. Also hate that the mini games are the same ones over and over. I sometimes just ignore them because they rarely help me get new items."
"I just started a day or so ago, but so far the main game is fine and there looks to be a lot to do and build. As in most games, there are side-projects and the one I'm doing now is a match-3 makeover game, but it's a bit tedious in how many boards you have to clear to accomplish anything, and the boards get stupidly hard. I guess the point is to keep you busy while the timers are counting down on your town, but it's more frustrating than entertaining and I'm not sure I'll keep the app."
"I have been playing this game for years and love it! I have noticed, however, this year you are no longer decorating the towns buildings for the holidays. That is so disappointing, as that made the game experience so much better. The animals costumes were adorable, but you have to purchase those through the golden ticket now and win them. I won't be able to decorate mine, I have been stuck on the same level in the match two game since the most recent one started. Thank you"
"I rate this app a four because it is a great game, but it has its problems. THis is not a big problem but it can take very long (to long) for food and crops to finish growing or done being produced at a factory. It is a little annoying when I just want to play the game and not have to put it down every other 30min to wait for one thing to be done. I had an idea event where you could make things be done quicker. Just an idea. That is all. Thank you for reading this reveiw."
"Ads saying the ads are not fake.. still a lie. l like the game, but I got it before the fake ads. We like the game the way it is, why fake ads? I like exploring the challenges, but there's no way I'll get to play out the whole story before it ends. I'm never able to finish the projects/themes in time. Pretty addictive. This is a match game, not a mini challenge game. So, it's not as depicted in the ads, but still pretty good. Keep making good changes."
SEE NEW COMMENT BELOW: Love this game and team players!!!. It becomes more difficult. But I like my team. Only one problem: Saw an ad on another game. It was false advertising for gardenscapes....Showing inaccurate way to play the game. Makes me sad. But this isn't the only game that does that in their ads. ☹️
"Great game! I like the challenges and the mini side quest games. The only thing I am nick picking is the butterflies when it comes to the games. When using the power bombs, the butterflies don't pop up like they are supposed to, and I have to spend coins or try again just to complete the level. So please fix that please."
"My mother and I really like playing this game. It has a great storyline, and the graphics are stunning. However, I have encountered an issue with the offline mode. Despite being labeled as such, the game actually requires internet connection to play. Hopefully, the developers can fix this problem soon. Update: it's working perfectly. I guess I was testing on downtime."
"I love the storyline so far, I'm hooked! I love the whole idea of the main character, but I get annoyed with the ""wow"" at the end of every game I want to like him, but it's repetitive and a kind of odd. I would've given 5 stars but there's levels you get stuck on at times and its frustrating there's really no other way around it, and your bonus items at the beginning of some levels make it impossible to have any benefits throughout the level when you start off with very little room to move."
"I am at well over level 4000 and for the past several months have been having issues with loading, and glitching. I have to shut my computer down manually in order to even exit the game. I'm thinking all the bonus games that are being added are causing the issues. Love them, but since they started adding these, the game is nearly impossible to play due to all of the freezing, glitches and just plain crashing. Please fix this?? I don't want to quit the game! :("
"Fun game. Unfortunately, it takes forever to beat the harder levels unless you pay for the health and booster bonuses. Additionally, in the recent cooking mini game, my game does not always save my progress when I close the app despite me saving my progress in the settings menu. Three times now, I've saved my progress, exited the app, and reopened the app to discover the cooking game didn't save my progress from my last visit, meaning I have to do everything over again. It's aggravating."
"I played this game for years, over level 1200. I really like the puzzles in this game. The game does sometimes make things impossible to beat. Hold out, after a few days they'll give you better moves and let you pass. I've never spent a penny on this game. As you get farther in the game, the pop ups of different events and story-lines are really annoying if you just want to hurry and play. But its not so bad that I've quit. The stories are cute and customizable decor is fun."
Been playing this game for a few years. Gave it 4 stats cause of the false advertisement of the game play that I keep seeing. Its not what the game actually is. I do enjoy gardenscapes...I can get on for about 15 mins each day. Just a quick game to do in between my real world tasks. I avoid the in-game special events...it waste your energy which is needed to fix/decorate the garden.
"A very fun & relaxing game! The levels aren't impossible too pass, but do have some challenge to them. The stories are cute & characters are lovable. It's quite a good game, and I'm quickly becoming addicted! The ads weren't misleading either as they do often have mini-games with what they advertised. My only problem currently is that some of the mini-game levels glitch out and I can't see the water. I can still play it, but the lack of visuals can mess up some gameplay at times."
"Great games overall! I gave it 4 only because I do appreciate the challenging levels, but getbored if I have to play several sets of lives, use all my boosters and spend too many coins to have even a small chance. Its much more enjoyable to win a challenging level while figuring it out on your own even if it takes a few lives, rather than money. I'm sure it's difficult for developers to find the balance for us!"
"The game is fun, I am at the highest level and I never spent a dime on it. Some levels are hard to beat, no doubt, you can get stuck for days, and then suddenly get lucky. I would definitely give it 5 stars if not for the deceiving adds for this game. This is a match 3 game with some additional features to get more boosters. The adds look completely different though..."
"I've been addicted to this game for 2 years now, and I would've given it 5 stars if it weren't for a couple of issues I have with it. First, when pieces fall and should form an explosive, many times the pieces clear too quickly and the explosive isn't there. Pieces shouldn't clear until all are settled. Also, the orangery flower gave more rewards. Now we have a bonsai tree that requires more levels cleared but gives less reward, no boosters until it's completed. Otherwise, I love the game."
"Really fun game. Just a few minor gripes that are keeping it from being a five star in my opinion. Firstly, there are sometimes chances to receive unlimited lives for a certain time frame. It's really annoying that you can't choose when to use these. I typically receive them at really inconvenient times and have no chance to utilize them. Secondly, cross save among different platforms is not available. Please add this, other mobile games like bubble witch 3 have it available."
"Overall this game is enjoyable. I find no large issues with gameplay, there haven't been any bugs or glitches I have experienced. the graphics are nice, and the levels are not unbeatable. I like the fact that in game characters will sometimes gift you life, so you dont need to ""connect with friends"", and plenty of events grant unlimited lives, which allows me to keep playing for hours and not feel pressured when I have a hard or super hard level to beat. I wish we had more options for decorating"
The game is fun! It really makes you think about how to solve the puzzles! The only thing I find myself wishing for is a back button to undo a move (but maybe that would make the game too easy!). I also wish for more variety about choosing a character as an avatar to my liking. I had a small amount of options to choose from. There were mostly white characters and a few ethnic looking people. I would also like to choose/decide how my butler looks the same way I would like to choose my avatar. 👍
"The game is fun and challenging but it also rips the player off by doing things like occasionally changing the color of pieces when you're close to winning so that you either have to use coins to continue or start over. Also, the amount that it costs for extra moves is completely disproportionate to the amount of coins recieved after winning a game and they're even stingier if it's a difficult level."
"I LOVE THIS GAME!!! The reason why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is b cause there are some really challenging levels that you cannot complete without extra boosters. They do give you some for completing a level within the first try and for accomplishing certain goals, but it feels as if you are forced to make a purchase if you want to continue playing."
"Not as fun as Homescapes is, in my opinion, but okay to play when you run out of lives on Homescapes. 😏 As much as I do love the outdoors in real life, renovating a garden in a game just isn't as fun or appealing as being able to renovate Austin's childhood home, having the ability to choose between different styles of furniture, & getting to know some of his friends & family. I do like that on Gardenscapes, you earn a lot more for each level that you beat, though. 😳 Maybe it gets better further into the game..? Just not enough story-line to draw me in (yet?)."
"I have been playing Gardenscapes for years now. I would have good luck mostly, and also times when it was more challenging. I always thought it was a great game until about a year ago. It started NEVER progressing... I couldn't get ANYWHERE! I had nothing to barter with and couldn't even win the most basic area's that I've played 100's of times before!! I finally, deleted it. Now I've been seeing ads for it. It looks different. Does it really have the fires, floods, accidents now like it shows?"
"Overall, I love the game. I can be stuck on a level for days then win with moves left over. It's challenging enough, but please, please stop having so many events piled on top of one another that constantly open popups. There's already an icon to click if I want event info. Likewise, I hate the mini games. They're childish and for supposedly being logic games it makes no sense at all to have them in this game. It detracts from the experience. The challenge levels are fun though."
"The game is fun and challenging. Some puzzles are difficult, but sooner or later you can solve them. The story is is a nice way to progress through the game. The animation and sounds are very pleasant. The demo of the game is misleading. It makes you think that you choose different options to fix problems, not a match 3 similar objects in a puzzle. Overall its fun."
I really enjoy playing this game but I recently had an issue with one of the levels and the feedback wasn't very helpful. Please make an update so that butterflies dont take more than 3 or 4 moves to show up. I went more than 10 moves with no butterflies and lost my winning streak. Very disappointed because this game is amazing otherwise. Would have given 5 stars.
"Challenging, without a ton of ads, but room for improvement Once you get over the bait-and-switch (because the games in the ads almost never happen), this is a decently challenging match-3 game. The early levels are really easy if you play these games a lot, but they get progressively harder in the triple-digit levels. There's just enough variety of tasks and boards to keep you playing. I wish you could turn off the match suggestions -- they get distracting when you're planning out your moves."
"Fun game to pass the time. With the recent update the pieces start flashing almost immediately to show you a possible move. I wish they would either give you the option to disable this or at least have a 5 second minimum before it flashes, it's really annoying and when you're trying to look for the best move, I don't need some flashing pieces to distract me. Other than that it's fun."
"I really enjoy the game, but the microtransactions are too over the top. The game developers really throw them in your face. That said, the game is challenging one you get to the higher levels, and the story line and garden options are very well written/designed. It is very satisfying to complete the new areas in the garden. I just wish the microtransactions weren't constantly paraded in front of me, it's the only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review."
"I really love this game, but after the last update I've been getting ads every time I unlock my phone; the same ads I get when I watch ads for coins. I cant get rid of spam ads and think I have to uninstall the game. Also, the ads are getting longer and are completely irrelevant. They are now so long they have buffering problems.  Update: Other apps were updated as the same time as this game.  I uninstalled them one at a time and resolved the problem.  The spontaneous ads that interrupted other programs were not as a result of this game.  The medication ads are still irritating,  but only affect me in game.  I have high speed connection and a current phone.  That is not the cause of the buffering issue."
"Beautiful game and a great twist on Match-3 games, but having to complete a level for the most miniscule of tasks gets pretty tedious. Plus it seems the more you progress, the more levels you have to complete for most tasks. I'm already past level 100 and I've only completed two areas. Combine some of this pestering multistep tasks, especially the ones that aren't even really related to restoring the Garden."
"Some levels will say they're normal, but they will be extremely hard to beat. Be prepared for extraordinary hard levels. I'll be stuck for days on a single level. The garden is super pretty and it is fun to decorate. I wish there were more things to do in the app so you dont just log in, play for 10 minutes with no progression, and try again in another hour or two"
"It's very fun, levels are still possible to beat without the boosters but easier with them. I don't like is that there is a lot of unnecessary things happening while rebuilding the garden like the guests are always coming through and you must do stuff for them that costs you stars. I want is to decorate/rebuild the garden not pull some helicopters off of the roof. Too many things going on, some of the missions require 3+ stats, gets irritating. All I want to do is to simply rebuild the garden."
"fun, addictive and challenging. it does get frustrating getting stuck on a level without coins or boosters - sorry, not spending real money on a game, I'll just keep trucking along until I get it. again though, fun and addictive. I would have to critique that every menial task requires a star - why do I have to beat a level to start a new day? I do wish the game play was more like it is portrayed in the ads, but it's all based on matching."
This game is challenging. I believe you are able to beat all levels without power ups. It comes down to skill and luck. So this is a fun game. My one problem with this game is the amount of stars it takes to complete a task. I'm past level 800. I now sometimes need 8 stars to complete a task and no less than 4. That's a bit ridiculous. I love how easy it is to get power ups and unlimited play. It would be great if you could lower the star amount I'm sure as i progress so will the amount of stars
Went back and edited my review. Great game. I love a good challenge. However as of right now I'm level 809 and I have yet to see anything in the screenshots above except the match 3 game. You most certainly do not get to choose which tool to use. You get to choose a certain color of an object but not what goes there. Misleading on that part.
"False advertising on what the game really is. I mean the ad is everywhere and looks funny. But when you actually start playing the game, it's nothing like that add. Thus a star being taken off. With that being said, it is a pretty fun and decent game otherwise for me to kick back and kill time while I'm waiting on other things in different games to finish. Graphics are pretty stellar, too."
"This game is pretty fun, and I like it a lot. The only problem I have is when you fail a level. You get the option to add five turns or concede, and if you hit concede you get an ""Are you sure?"" message and you have to concede again. My problem is that there is no ""Are you sure?"" message when you buy five turns and the buttons right next to each other, so if you mis-hit the five turns button your 900 coins are gone faster than OJ in a Bronco. I get they want us to spend and buy coins, but really"
"I enjoy the game for the most part. My only complaint is that they didn't design it so after say 6 or 7 tries on some level you still can't win that level. I just stop playing for a few days then go back. but sometimes it will take 3 or 4 times of doing that before it finally clears. at one point I was going to delete the game all together. like I said frustrating, cause I do like the game."
"This game is fun, but it ABSOLUTELY does not care. It's great that there are no commercials in it, and I understand that they give you a limited number of lives so that you'll feel inclined to purchase more if you run out...but at the start of some levels, there's no consideration to the setup of match-able items; and the levels can sometimes, literally be impossible to do beat given the board, in the allotted number of moves. Still fun though."
"I agree with the others. Its becoming to the point its impossible to beat, then after a week of trying all of a sudden you beat the level. 4 updates ago when logging on it gets a quarter of the way and stops. Takes a full minute before it continues to load. Whats up with that? I understand the higher you go it gets more difficult, but it shouldn't be impossible. I won't spend money just to enjoy playing a game. Ill delete it first."
"This is a great game, but it has been updated with less moves on the more difficult levels. It takes days to beat a level sometimes. I don't like how you can incidentally hit the 5 more plays button because of where it is situated. It should be moved or an ""are you sure you want to spend your hard earned 900 points for 5 more useless moves"" button. Should give you an option to deselect."
"I enjoy the game. It is hard enough to make me strategize, but easy enough to not frustrate me. There are many times I can only try a more challenging level 5 times before I am out of lives, but am patient, and try again later. I miss the garden bucks/deco, like the renovations, love the adventures, and don't really care for the makeovers. I haven't bought anything or been able to complete many renovations, but still have a lot of fun playing game, and have almost made level 7500. Thanks!"
"Game not as advertised. Not a choice game to pick objects to help out in situations. This is one of those building games. In this one you build gardens. It's ok, but I personally don't like these kinds of games. False advertising. Nothing like the ad at all. (Update:) Game has been updated to include choice pick mini games. Much better, very challenging."
"It's a great game! I love decorating my garden, and the levels are pretty fun! The art/art style and animation is absolutely amazing. It's overall great, and I'd recommend downloading it. There's just one problem that caused me to give it 4 stars instead of 5. Some of the levels are so hard it takes day/weeks to win them. Maybe it's just me, though. 9/10, awesome game. :)"
"I came for the garden, I stayed for the content. This game did change my mind about match 3 games, with the way it incorporates so many twists & obstacles, it feels more like solving puzzles than mindlessly matching 3 of the same thing. Some levels are extremely annoying because ""hard"" levels are only hard because of chance, luck of the draw, not skill or puzzle solving abilities. Some ""easy"" levels are actually difficult, some ""hard"" levels are actually easy. In game ads are optional."
"I like the story, I like the charm of the whole world, and I even like the teams. I DON'T like feeling railroaded to spend money to continue on ""easy"" levels whenever I've been given a timed unlimited bomb/rainbow/TNT timer without the unlimited lives. 4 stars b/c very few ads in game. Updated: I found that if you don't play (or even open) the game for 7+ days, your ""difficult"" levels may suddenly become easy or different levels entirely."
"I absolutely love this game. I have been playing for years-on many devices- without spending any money. It definitely requires strategy and patience. I love the new ""super challenge"" levels and the opportunity for the 15 minute power-up as well as other prizes. The only downside is that you can't go from one type of phone (I phone) to another phone (I believe it was an android) and keep your level. You can, however, go from an lg to an lg and save your game still. 4.5 rating!"
"Enjoyed the game despite the fact that the ads for it are very misleading. You only get to play the bonus puzzle levels about once every 100ish levels. Found it to be tolerable f2p (free to play) game, a little strategy and you can still make your way through the levels. Only ever get stuck for a day or two a few times, which is an expected nuisance."
"I play almost every day. Sometimes I can breeze through levels, other times I'll get stuck for days on levels that are regular, not super hard, which is frustrating. Then I lose out on 2x stuff. I do not p2p, only use Google credits I earn from other apps. The garden is pretty and I like that you can change things. The room decorating challenges get annoying because I've never been able to finish one in time because the stuff is so expensive."
"I really like this game. It's very well made and the designs are fun with some good options for customization. However, although I understand the need for in app purchases, I wish the coins and boosters went further. And that there were more times when stars where doubled per level. Overall though, this is a fun way to pass the time."
"Fun puzzle game with pleasant graphics and marginally customizable garden. You get a dog! The only thing I don't like about it is the constant ranking you're forced to participate in, as if you get stuck on a level for a while you can't advance and it's really easy to move back down a league, but on the plus side the leagues really don't matter lol"
"At level 5900. Thank you Gardenscapes for such a great game and great story line. Regretfully, I am about done though. The levels are just getting way too hard. I am increasingly unwilling to make increasing expenditures to keep things going. I will really miss Austin and friends even though they're just computer generated characters. Some things just become impractical after a while. For those of you just getting started, enjoy. But just know where you will stop when the time comes."
Love the game but be prepared to spend money as you reach higher levels if you want to progress in a timely fashion and not have to keep playing the same level for days. I agree with others that it is frustrating to lose all power ups on the difficult level. It would be nice to have the choice to participate in the level rather than automatically trying and losing everything. The prizes for those levels aren't really on par for the risk. But great job to the talented people constucting the game
"Started out fun and addicting, but it getting very tiresome. I really loved it, now it's soooo frustrating!!!! Some levels are extremely hard to pass, It costs 900 coins for 5 extra moves. Yet the amount of coins won for each level is so really low. 🤔🤔🤔🤔 I'm contemplating whether to uninstall. It would be great if the amount of lives were increased to 10."
"i really enjoy this game, fun way to kill some time or something to zone out to laying in bed unable to sleep, lol. giving it only 4 out of 5 though for 2 reasons. 1. Sometimes easy level are INSANELY hard and hard ones REALLY easy. Feel its a bit of developer trickery to use specials. and 2. Winning free lives time is fun, but kind of annoying it ticks away when it cant be used. Events end late at night when Im getting ready for bed and I either waste the time or cant play to save it for later."
"I don't like the fact that I was trying to play a puzzle solving game like in the demos it shows and I was let go this game, not cool and very misleading, falsifying pretty much, still looking for a puzzle solving game, some of the levels are way too difficult and time consuming especially if you get the 30min or higher infinite lives. I am enjoying the game disregarding the issues I stated."
"While the game is fun to play, it isn't anything like the video portrays, pity since that looks like an amazing game! There isn't any options to exchange items with other players, you don't have unlimited design choices, only 3, and it would be really helpfull if you could save the unlimited lives instead of having to use them immediately when it's inconvient to do so."
I play this game from time to time and enjoy it from time to time as well. The reason I gave one star to this app is that the game makes it challenging and difficult to beat sometimes and after some frasturation you start paying money to beat certain levels. Sometimes you never get to pass levels without spending. This is a very dangerous game for younger or older.
"Nicely done so far (I'm at Level 34) Like the graphics, the details, the interactivity with the game was an unexpected delight. Only 1 Star rewarded upon completion of each game puzzle. However, as long as only 1 or 2 stars are needed to do the projected projects throughout the garden then I am content with it. BUT as I get further in the game...I hope the ""stars"" DON'T increase to complete said projects in the garden. Thus, would likely deter me away"
"I like this game immensely, however I don't enjoy when it makes you do all the side tasks, with the dog for example. That just takes away stars from doing tasks that actually involves restoring the gardens. Seems like as you get higher and higher in levels the hard and super hard levels are more frequent. Also some tasks should not require as many stars to compete and I don't think it should take stars to start a new day. Otherwise I really enjoy this game."
"Really loved this game, even when it was a hidden object game on the computer. The ""choose-your-own-decorations"" feature is a big plus, I think it adds to the appeal of the game being able to customize freely like that. The side contests also are a great competitive influence with great payouts to help you in your game. Hope you guys make another game, thanks so much for the fun times."
"I enjoy playing this game on the whole and I understand higher levels should be a bit challenging, but it can take several days to get past a level and it is only worth 1 star. What are the other areas, that are dark now, going to be like? When do you reach them? It would be nice to have some easier puzzles / games / challenges thrown in once in a while. Maybe different kinds of games, other than match 3 types could be used. Please and Thank you."
"-1 star because the new ads are misleading. Otherwise, this is a great match 3 game. I have NEVER had to buy currency to finish a level - the harder levels DO take a bit of luck but I save my power ups until I am really stuck. There are always little challenges that earn you power ups, or infinite lives for 30 minutes (which stacks) so go for those!"
"Gardenscapes is a super addictive game! It combines ""Candy Crush Like"" levels with renovating a mansion garden. Some of the levels are easy and some are very difficult. It can be extremely frustrating when you get stuck and there is no option for skipping levels. overall a great game!"
"Love the game, strongly disagree with the cost of playing. 900 coins for 5 extra moves is ridiculous. We aren't rewarded that well and most games end in failure if the players choose not to buy the boosters. So try, try again. The game is kept interesting with the many side quests which are fun and can be quite challenging. Regards to the game programmers. Thanks"
"Like the game. Story line is cute, like that I can choose to interact with it, or skip, and whether I chose to complete tasks or not doesn't affect ability to move to next level only if I beat the previous level. Also like it's either I did or didn't best the level, no go back because I haven't connected enough starts, gems, diamonds, are whatever due to only 1or 2 out of 3 on a level. Hard levels are hard levels. No matter which match 3 game you choose they'll always be a hard level you can get stuck on for days, every weeks depending on the'power ups' you've collected. My one complaint about Gardenscapes is more than once I've come levels with rocks that have to be cracked to remove, and they have to be removed to beat the level. I've spent weeks playing and only ever have one or two options of moved from the very beginning, none of which allow the pieces to drop so that a any type power up that would break apart/crack the rock can be formed. Unless one can be contacted on a daily spin this makes the level impossible to beat. IMO there is simply something innately wrong with that. Three initial layout of pieces should allow for the creation of at least one of these items. It's never completely random, but it should be at least possible no only 3 match options for every move allowed."
"This is the game you're looking for, as in there are no pop-up ads, ability to play offline, purchasable items but they are not necessary in order to advance in the game, create or join your own interactive team and compete together, there's plenty of lvls and new areas added often, very challenging and overall just a good game. If there's any negative, it'd be that it takes 25 mins to regenerate a life and it only stores up to 5 lives, so every 100 lvls beat should give us an extra banked life."
Have really enjoyed the game but have noticed as time has gone by that it's not worth buying the tickets now. Use to you could get prizes of play time individually or in the mystery boxes but not anymore except maybe at the last stage of the event. Some of the levels have been made so hard that you have to spend coins to finish that level. So it comes down to money.
"Great game. I've played this off and on for a long time. It's a matching, and some of the levels get hard, but you do get items to help with the levels. This game does not get 5 stars due to false advertising. Ads placed on the internet and within other games do not reflect the actual gameplay of this app. This is a matching game; not a pick what item best fixes the problem game. You need to fix the advertising."
"honestly...i love the game... designing the gardens anyways...i like the story... it just bothers me how many levels you have to play to get anything done... and all of the little things that are thrown in that take two and three levels to do... that have nothing at all to do with the gardens... just really frustrating... but otherwise...i appreciate the thought and time you've put into it... especially the ""zen"" garden"
"Addictive for sure but it's really satisfying when you finally solve a puzzle you've been stuck on. The garden renovating is fun, too. Some of the mini events feel impossible to complete sometimes but over-all the game is a fun way to kill time. Also, sometimes I'll move a peice one wayand it goes the opposite way and ruins my chances to solve a puzzle but that seems to be happening a lot less lately."
"It's very fun. There are a lot of challenging levels that you have to fail at a couple of times before you figure out the strategy for success. It has a lot more interesting elements to the levels than other similar puzzle games, and every so often they'll add another interesting aspect to the mix. There's also a decent story, and the garden itself is fun to build. Really, there were only a couple of things that I'd like changed- In the animated version of the characters, a lot of their eyes are bulged out and it's kind of weird, haha. And finally...The storage it takes up. I was up to 390 MB, and it was still growing. That's just too big. It's over 100 MB more than any of my other apps. I ran out of room, so I'll be uninstalling it today. Sorry, I had fun."
"This is a game where an easy round can take you 5+ lives to pass, and one shot to pass a super hard one. It depends on rng. I haven't spent any real money in it because I don't feel it's necessary. They give you ads to watch for coins. Additionally, they often give you 1-3 hours of unlimited lives as rewards. Every time you start a new day, they refill your lives, so I usually play until i lost all my lives then start a new day."
I like the but the levels with blocking wall is a little bit on the fair side towards the player with you could destroy the walls. I understand what they are trying to do as far as a new element to mess with the player. But if you get a fruit and it makes a bomb it goes on the wall side. I feel if the fruit is being blocked but could make a bomb it should be free to use. Not the other way around
Fun to pass time. Playing for over a year now. Some levels are so hard it's ridiculous. You literally pay money just to beat the level and that's a turn off so I haven't played in a few months. At Level 9267!! Unreasonably hard levels with not enough power ups given to enjoy the game without emptying your wallet of all extra cash. And what happened to the mini games??!!!
Enjoy the Butler's adventures and movie through the levels. The graphics are really good and there's no glitches with the software and crashing on you. If you looking for a good way to pass the time unlike this type of match game this one's for you. I'm already on my way to the 3rd level and having a great time with the adventures the butler goes through. With the stranger in the woods It's also Kind of mysterious. Can't wait to get back out on the Lake or up to the waterfall are some of the other adventures that are included in the game. I highly recommend this game to people to like match games with something a little extra on the side.
Help Playrix!! I am on level 8040-something! It keeps advertising for the homescapes game and I have clicked both options but it won't let me play!! I am trying to finish the renovation thats going on plus I paid for fluffy season and I CAN'T PLAY!!!!! It is just staying stuck on the same screen with ZERO options to move past the screen talking about playing the other game!!!
I've been playing thus for a long while and I love it. Unfortunately there is a bug my game has where after I complete the Austin's dream mini game the prompt to play another level but with no image pops up again and again no matter how many time I close it. Gets really annoying and makes the game unplayable and I have to keep restarting the app.
"It's frustrating at times, either it doesn't give you the pieces you need or worse! There are levels that start with certain pieces you need to do first, but if you have the bonus boosters it messes it up so you have to wait until you lose your boosters to actually do the level. Maybe add a option so you can use boosters when you want."
"I got sick of seeing the ridiculous ads, so I downloaded to see what it was all about, and while the ads are NOTHING like the actual game, the game itself is so enjoyable! It's calming. The music is chill and the visuals are appealing. It's basically Candy Crush but with more gameplay elements and a more laid back aesthetic. The game itself is 5/5 but it loses a star because of it's unnecessary advertising."
"Fun game to pass the time. Sometimes it feels like you will never pass a level (hard levels) without spending money. This is when I start getting discouraged with the game and not play it for a couple of days. Then eventually I pass the level, but not with out thinking I am going to delete the app. Fun times!!!"
"As a parent I like the game for my child. It's very intriguing and the puzzles are challenging the more you go up and it goes give a sense of accomplishment. Like the dog and Austin. Overall, however, its way too expensive especially if your child is playing it. More parent friendly ways to make Gold etc is really needed."
"I really like this game, but it is a bit too difficult at times and lives take too long to replenish. I would love to see the option to watch ads or something to earn more lives. Depending on friends for lives doesn't work because my network of friends don't like to be bothered by game requests. 5 lives isn't enough when you consider the difficulty and the amount of time it takes for them to replenish."
"The gameplay is interesting, but the storyline is lacking. The storyline is interesting for first few levels. after a while there are no choices to make and not very good options of things to buy. So you don't have much control over what the garden looks like. If you are playing for the story, keep looking. There is very little that distinguishes it from other matching games."
This would be 5 stars if it weren't for the spiders. I'm arachnophobic. I have downloaded and deleted this game dozens of times hoping the add will be gone but it always pops back up and I can not touch my phone until it is gone. I have been on winning streaks ands it messed up the run. Some times I will be able to flip it face down long enough to power the phone off which works but I lose any fun I had built up in the game. Hope this will help. I'm sure you lose a lot of players.
"Sometimes very difficult but great and relaxing. If you don't want to spend money in order to continue play, you'll spend a lot of time waiting for your lives to refresh. Unfortunately you cannot buy the game, you must buy tokens within the game on a recurring basis when you need them. If this game are available as a full pay app where full payment removes the need to purchase anything more, I would definitely buy this game!"
"ADDICTED...Love this game! The only thing I don't like is if I earn free time, I cant come back to use it. I earned 3 hours one time but once I touch my phone screen to do something else, the time starts and I end up loosing/wasting most of it bc it starts automatically and I can't play straight thru that long. I wish it wouldn't start until you were ready."
"I didn't spend any money playing this game. I finished the original gardens and have just moved over the river to a new site. However, since doing so, the game's performance has gotten sluggish, the games are harder so it's taking me more and more time to even win a single game and so many of the challenges are for petty stuff that need 3 or 4 points and it's sucking up too much space on my tablet. Bottom line, it's not so much fun anymore and I will be uninstalling it."
"Game is nothing like its ads! No logic puzzles. It is a builder theme, restoring a mansion . You must complete Candy Crush type boards to pass levels. Otherwise, an engaging game. Drawbacks: higher levels nearly impossible to beat without in-app purchases. Really do not design your own garden. The butler makes all of the decisions. You just occasionally choose a colour or style of an item. Takes 2 1/2 hours to refill 5 lives. Unless, of course, you purchase them. Better than most!"
"I would have given it 5 stars but it's hard to get people to join your team, it is difficult when your team members don't help other team members and because some other levels are ridiculous Hard It's a great game if you like a challenge and puzzles. But as I said they don't rotate the teams and enough in order for people to be able to join your team at random. Basically you have to make friends through Facebook to find friends in the game. I thank the players in the game should be avail 2 all!"
"Not what was advertised, which is why it loses a star, but rather a very challenging match-3. You can play for free if you are patient enough to attempt some levels a dozen times & save up your specials. The rating of the levels as hard or super hard seems pretty random too. Developers do pretty regular updates and I really like the new team format and events."
"It's a little too easy to fat-finger a switch on accident, and ruin your chances of winning that round, so an Undo button would be nice. Hard Rounds occur a little too frequently. I do not care for the addition of the renovation money challenge. Other than that, I play this game non-stop."
"This game is fun in many ways but it has some flaws. 1. The game disconnects easily and whenever I try to shut down or close the app and re-open it, it still wouldn't reconnect. 2. Whenever you are disconnected, you can't access your team (which is understandable) or the competition that you are in (which is annoying because your place doesn't move whenever you get disconnected.) 3. Getting new lives takes forever. How about lower the time to a good solid 15 or 20 minutes."
"The game itself is actually one of the most well done I've played as an app. It's surprisingly dense and you can tell the developers were top notch. However, the ads for it are very misleading. The ads you see with puzzles/ mazes are actually mini games that only occur every once in a long while. I don't understand why they didn't advertise the actual gameplay. It's a good game so why not showcase it correctly? A few months later and 1.3k games in there have been a total of 2 mini games."
I Love this game! would have given 5 stars if I had a better experience when buying coins for extra moves. About 30% of the time the game ends then I have to start the level all over- which defeats the purpose of my buying coins in the first place. I'd also like to be able to trade in the upgrades for different ones; esp. holiday decor.
Some levels start off with only having 1 or 2 moves. Those moves give you the powerup to pass that level. Unfortunately when you have a winning streak your own power ups get placed in the beginning of the level. They take up the spaces that make those first moves possible making it impossible to pass the level therefore losing your win streak because you have to start over. That's why I give it 4 stars. I've been playing this game for a few years now and I love it!
"The game itself is fun to play, but there are no true instructions for the game nor the levels as you get past level 9, it becomes more difficult & at level 15, it is even harder with the items blinking ... So I gave it a four , should have been less. You don't even receive enough coins or hearts when you do pass the levels, too much up and down on it. I am uninstalling it..."
"Quickly addicted to this game! But 4 stars because I can't switch devices and keep my current game. After logging in with Facebook, can switch devices with current progress saved. Happy with that. I wish the game made it possible to complete a garden area or room before running out of time. I am in the 700 levels and have not been able to complete a room yet. The ticket prices are too high in my opinion. Feels like it's unobtainable. Same with garden areas."
"I enjoy the game. It's a good way to spend time and you don't have to spend money Edit: I still play the game in 2021 but, as expected, the levels have gotten more difficult. It would be nice if we received more power ups for logins or if the cost for 5 more moves was reduced. There are $0.99 packs you can buy that are helpful but the costs add up after awhile. Still a good game however"
"So this is a fun game with great concept and no forced ads. Hence, this is the only game i still keep on my phone. I understand development isn't free and the strategy to have difficult levels that drain you of all your boosters and coins and still does not complete at least for a few days. So either be patient or spend money. But my complaint is the timing. It seems even easy level gets stuck if there is a challenge going on thus NEVER giving the player a chance to complete it which is unfair."
"A nice take on the match 3 game, especially since there's a story and visible results. Only downside is the usual free to play ploy of having infuriatingly difficult levels to try to get you to use up your boosters to the point that you feel you need to buy more. Lots of in game contests that award boosters helps offset the mechanic to some extent, though. Overall pretty happy with the game."
"Great game, great animation, fun events, fun storyline. Sometimes levels are annoyingly too hard to beat, meaning several hours of my life were lost on one level for way too long. And unfortunately, once the levels get higher, I understand a decent level of difficulty in the loss of 1 or 2 lives, but not hours worth. Sadly, this happens very often."
"Really love the controls! My only gripe is that there's no touch option to Expand the map on the upper right corner of the screen. But this game really is good, though! I'd give the 5 stars... BUT! IF y'all can do me a solid and make that function real,'tap to expand map' to full screen and move (and shoot) at the same time, I'll reconsider! But to anyone reading this! Great visuals! A realistic lighting and you'll see when you play the game and everything else is 😩👌"
"Its good so far. Fun action, entertaining, engaging, stimulating. I'll write a review when I finish. My only problem so far is that I don't have enough control over the camera angle. When I click outside of the shooting circle I thought that would let me move the camera but only the option to move it behind the player works. I almost feel bad about how good I feel blasting these mutants, though. Oops."
"Good shooter gameplay. Controls are hard to get used to and I always end up switching guns inadvertently, and camera movement makes gameplay and hitting the mutants difficult. In light of all this, there's no interruptions from ads, except by choice and you can skip thru some of them and still get the reward. I would recommend it!"
"This game is old by now, but still totally worth it. It has micro-transactions (which I despise) but they were done correctly and not at all a nuisance. The gameplay loop is a solid, pick up and play for a few minutes one. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that all the levels are essentially visually the same. They're detailed and look good though, so it's only a minor complaint, frankly."
I struggled with this game the first time I tried it. I found it difficult to move the figure where I wanted to move it and to shoot accurately. I tried it again some 4 or 5 months later and either I've matured and improved or someone tweaked the settings or the game a little. I still struggle with the same things but not as bad as before and I actually enjoy the game a great deal.
"I think its a good made especially for mobile. Graphic arent too bad, neither is the gameplay or even the atmosphere of the levels which is awesome. If give it a five if there was more that happened with the story like when you first install it, maybe have the scientist pop up. Maybe the main character has a pop up in game from time to time to give personality. The concept art in the loading screen makes me wanting more and I'd feel more immersed if there was"
"Overall: 6 - Colorful variety of weapons and armour, sound design and the visuals are great, it's a very action packed game that rewards you for being fast and efficient, but none of that matter if the environments is nearly identical or if the enemies are the same 7 designs for 100+ levels, it's too repetitive for me but it's a nice game to play when I'm out and about. If the devs could add a few more enemy types and level designs I think my review would go up greatly. - by Death-Spider"
"Great game, gives my mobile a console (or at least handheld console) like experience. Works great with my controller and looks great when I plug my phone into a monitor. Woukd be 5 stars if we could be able to remap buttons though... Not a fan of the camera rotating with the player, wish it was more twin sticks to move and aim with the shoulder buttons to rotate the camera instead."
"Delving ever deeper into a mutant infested subterranean military facility, one begins to wonder if they will see the sun light again. Your only super power is the ability to carry nearly limitless amounts of ammunition. Fire your gun until the barrel is white hot. Then switch to the other. Familiarise yourself with retrograde maneuvering while firing, or die alot. It's a simple yet fun waste of time."
"Really good game you can actually enjoy without incessant prompts for microtransactions and pay to wins. HOW REFRESHING. HOW NOVEL. Other creators should take note of this! Also great that it works offline! My only gripe is that it took some time to adapt to the control scheme and the 3/4 top-down style. All in all, a lot of fun. Good work."
"Quite fun and can be played entirely legit, however there is technically pay-to-win features scattered about. The combat, while simple, feels satisfying and the weapons just as much so. It get's quite difficult the further you get in the game, so get gud, grind, or pay for better weapons. The graphics and animations are nice, and the attention to detail on the models + levels is great. *4.6 stars*"
"Lots of fun. No purchases necessary. Pretty good replay value. 3D roamer through interconnected rooms and chambers. 3rd person elevated view (whatever it's called) shooter with fun weapons. Last series of levels to descend through ridiculously difficult due to timer being added, which, indeed, makes the whole of it useless. Falls short of five stars for that reason. Nevertheless, every series up to last enjoyable, and replayable."
"It's a good game with lots of potential but I think that you need to fix the maps (It keeps moving in different directions so it can get confusing to know at the moment where to go), also the movement. I like space marshals 2, their controls are very fun & easy. Good game though!"
Great shooter with a couple issues. The first issue is that the control for the gun (right) will sometimes cause the character to run instead of shoot. When this happens it can be difficult to get it to work normally again. In addition this seems to happen at the worst possible moment. The other gripe I have is with the camera. It will occasionally refuse to look in the direction you want and it would be nice if it were at a slightly lower angle. You often find yourself shooting blind.
"All in all decient game,good way to kill time.Compatible with xbox controller via bluetooth,simple button layout. Playable online and off,with easily earned coin by the choice of quick ad or earned through playing.Cool variety of weapons.Multiple level with increase in monster difficulty.Only note Id like to add is the levels are repetitive. Would like to see some variations of missions and/or locations.Also would be nice to have some scavage opportunities."
"Cool game.. Gameplay is fantastic, and guns are neither too toyish nor overpowered. But there's a major flaw. It's pretty linear though, and there aren't any secrets... It's waaaaay too repetitive, I mean, the levels don't change that much. Level designer/s were a bit uncreative. ""Yeah, I'll just change the layout a bit, add a few more monsters on the next level and done. Next level please!"" That's it. Or at least that's the impression. But for some odd reason it's fun to repeat the experience."
"Fairly good. The controls are a bit confusing though. There should be more options of control configuration. Like the option to have separate buttons for each action, and if we could drag and drop the buttons to where we want them that would be ideal. I would have the movement joystick on the lower left, the fire button above that, also on the left, and on the right side everything would stay the same, except the aim joystick would just aim, it wouldnt do nothing else."
"Honestly very good game, you can see that is was made by people who cared. One medium-sized gripe, the powers are very hard to activate, especially in the middle of combat. The powers are somewhat unresponsive and can lead to me dieing. One change I would make for them is slowing down the game when you open the wheel so you can activate the powers. Otherwise a solid mobile game."
Nice game and it is fun to play. Everything is great except one thing that is camera controls. It is too wacky and makes your head spin for some time. Please improve the camera so that it stays fixed or it changes a little faster than right now. It makes the experience slow because you have to wait for the camera to catch up when turning around or fighting in close corners. It takes away from the experience. Please fix this. Overall I liked this game.
"Fun game but gets repetitive. Needs more variety in levels and weapons, add grenades and maybe some sort of system for setting traps. Only the assault rifles and shotguns are truely useful imo and once I got the plasma variants, I don't really feel the need to buy any other weapons so far. All that said, I play this game fairly regularly and it's a lot of fun. At the end of the day it can be played offline, it's immersive and runs fairly well with few ads, and it can be played in short bursts."
"Been playing this for 4-5 years. The touch screen controls are hard and I agree on some review that you have to aim and then fire. It's really frustrating at first but I believe you'll get used to it. Also it's repetitive; lacking of story on why she is in there and what's the relationship of her with the scientist, no cutscenes, the same enemies even if your progressing, same environment design. I will give 5 stars if they listen to the players."
"Great game (already fully played 2 times) but camera is annoying : the game is really dynamic as the camera is lazy. Camera is too close (just a little bit, but too close), is too slow (pretty good when super speed activated, but really to slow most of time), and it is fixed when you fire. The more you advance in the game the more you fire all the time, so the more you advance the more the camera is in the wrong direction all the time ! Center button doesn't help, it needs to stop moving/firing."
"Great fun, and with a PERFECTLY balanced learning curve. Starts off easy and slowly gets harder and harder, unlike a lot of shooting games I've played which start off easy then BOOM, next to impossible in the space of one mission. This game lacks instruction but it's easy enough to work out just by playing. Well worth a spin! I'll give it five stars when some more mission types are added; right now it's rather plain. But still great fun!"
"The game is good ,the graphics is little animatic which is suitable for the size. Controls are weird aiming makes difficult. Tasks are same in most of the levels. Boss are not shown in map but its nice to have a surprise attack. The character is in the middle of the screen and the zombies are out of the screen. The zombies comes near to the character before he notice them. And the map changes everytime when i open it . Other than these its a good game. Thanks for a good game."
"I really like the game style, even though GUI design could be better. I also found out there is a glitch with the minigun ""the ripper"". Another problem is when you pause the game and then resume while shooting (I guess it also must happen with other automatic guns due to the reiteration of the script code line, I guess) the sound suddenly vanishes and doesn't play anymore for the gun sound effect, except for the other sounds in the physical environment like walls and other objects."
"Fast, fluid and enthralling. I wasn't sure if this would be good but it's actually fun to play and very well done in terms of graphics, controls and gameplay. I like that you can endlessly respawn. I was surprised to see that there no way to buy this game outright. I suppose there hoping people will buy in game credits but it's totally playable without having to do that."
"Sharp graphics, good effects and fun gameplay. However I'm not sure why they made such an awkward camera - it actually makes it difficult to see what's ahead of you, so you end up relying on the minimap ( which shows enemies). Would also prefer it if the weapon/ armour choices were less linear ( basically they just get stronger as you go up tiers). That said, I like the fact that there is no pressure to spend real money - you can earn enough to upgrade your gear just by playing the game."
"Basic third person shooter with a few RPG elements. The best: the variety of guns, the casual gameplay and free to play. The worst: there are only 7 types of enemies in all the game and you get the feeling of playing the same scenario again and again. Overall, it is relaxing and entertaining."
An exceptionally well done mobile game. Love the feel of the old classics like Alien Breed. Ver very nice. Great atmosphere. Has that certain something to it right away. Very well made 2d and 3d graphics and gameplay as well as music/fx. Amazing job. The critique id have is that all that is somewhat tinted thru highly repetetive gameplayand graphics. I literally have the feeling of playing the same map over and over again doing the same things. Which for me is a no no and why I stopped playing.
"This game is so much fun. But it gets boring after a few levels because there's only 6/7 types of creatures and their AI is not very advance, the often get stuck behind walls. So, the game becomes repetitive. The weapon are too OP, once you buy the best guns and armor, you are unkillable. But still it's fun to get back to."
"Sure does remind me of Alien Swarm Reactive Drop. The controls are pretty simple yet the gameplay is pretty intriguitive. There isn't much in this game, aside from cleaning up site-infested mutants, farming coins and buying weapons, and playing the same level repeatedly. I lost my interest in it within my first 2 weeks of playing it, as it was lacking some other content such as a larger variety of sites and weapons. Nonethereless, the developers really did good."
"fun, conceptually simple dungeon-crawl shooter. runs very smoothly on my phone. levels come close to repetitive but have remained fun so far. impressive selection and scaling of weapons/armour. loses a point because controls are not the most intuitive, and especially the 'powers' menu being difficult to use quickly."
"Awesome game. Love the graphics,level design & the sound effects are amazing. Definitely a recommended game especially if you're into zombie shooters. I just think a little more could've been added to this for a little more depth such as optional rooms you can enter but requires you to find a key or collectibles hidden in each level that'll give bonus points at the end of said level."
"I d say it's a pretty good game, but would like some stuff to be present in it like some sort of a story, to make it deeper than just level after level, and it would be good if there was some sort of a looting system in place so you could enjoy the exploration more, and maybe different environments as well, i know that the developers don't enjoy sticking to one project but the game has a lot of potential."
"Good f2p game, but the ""highest kill streak"" rating i do not like. Once you get a higher streak, you are required to always hit it, otherwise you'll never hit 3* completion for any of the other maps, including earlier ones. Eg. you hit 11 kill streaks on map 2-3, then when you go back map 1-2, and you cant hit 11 kill streaks, then your score will always be 2 over 3 stars completion, and it's irritating that way."
Its not a bad game to be honest. The controls took some time to get used to seems as tho it was made to be played with a controller rather than the phone itself however. Some adjustments needed to be made from my end still a bit too sensitive even though. Many repetitive floors but still interesting enough to see what new monsters might pop up on you. Weapons and level ups are not that bad either. In ky personal opinion id say its a fare gam3 to pass the time with
"Pretty fun action game. Load time is really fast, don't need to pay at all, no ads, you could collect enough coins for equipment. The only thing I don't like too much is the counter for killing combo in a floor, is not clear at all, you could have secondary goals to read before start a floor."
"KILL 'EM ALL RAAAH! Also, the gameplay is pretty darned good. Solid controls (I need practice) and a good, simple gameplay loop. Probably the best twin-stick shooter I have played on a phone (looking forward to getting my controller on it)."
"Almost overall is amazing. The problem is why can't my score in the leaderboard increase even If I killed a lot of enemies like what the heck! How am I suppose to increase that. Since I logged in my google account, the score hasn't increased or decreased at all. Yes it has no connection to the game but it's there displayed, ""Zero score"" in the menu and it annoys me so much. Please fix it immediately"
Great Game! I enjoyed this game so much that I went to find more titles from the same developer. Pros - Nice shooter - Great graphics - Leveling up can be easily attained by watching ads - Controls are easy to figure out and (somewhat) intuitive Cons - Gameplay get monotonous - No variety in the levels or gameplay mechanics - Limited enemy types and no boss battles - Camera view hampers gameplay in some ways (you can't look ahead) - Aiming can be tricky - Objectives are pointless
Not bad has a lot of potential. These are the things I would change. 1: have a control setting where the camera always faces the laser. 2: have a higher veriety of enemies and environment. 3: change the goofy looking walk cylce animation. 4: have the flashlights correspond to their weapon color and have them all be the same brightness. 5: have an option to choose your own character. Things I liked is how you can watch ads to earn money for good equipment. Good job keep it up 👍
One of the very few great games here you can play to have a good time . Would like to see alot more enemies and environments in the future . Everything from the UI to the graphics is very well made . A little bit of story new monsters and levels will really help the game
"Great game but UI needs improvement. Would give it 5 stars if I could do 5 things...... Change camera distance, move the camera reset button to the right side, move the secondary skill button/wheel, and have a dedicated weapon swap button, and DISABLE SCREEN SHAKE. Seriously, this last one is a no brainer. Just give us UI customizations. Also don't need some interface graphics so large."
Good Game but needs improvement. I like the gameplay but there needs to be an option to adjust zoom levels as well as one to crop the game so parts of it are not cut off by camera cutouts on newer phones. I also noticed that it hasn't been updated for three years.
This is a nice game. However it would be cool if you add multiplayer parties to complete missions and tasks using personal hotspot without the use of internet and add more different maps because it gets too boring if you would play the game over and over again for the same places. And also please add storyline or something to make the game more definable on how did the allien landed and so on. Hope my review helps! Looking for the next update.
"Pros: Not P2W. Decent Graphics. No Ads. Wonderfully Paced and Free? This game is too good to be true. Con: Control sensitivity is unadjustable (even after adjusting it). Needs to be fixed as it makes aiming difficult. Would also appreciate a Graphic setting for the game. Because, theres a lot going on, Gameplay can lag or slow at times."
"The game has a rigid structure even though it has great graphics et al. Apart from the differences and complexity of different monsters, the game doesnt really look different. I'm giving it 4 stars because i enjoyed the game for a while and the developers have great apps that i love."
"Its not a fantastic game, it lacks in replayability. what it does have is smooth gameplay, i didnt feel too challenged and enjoyed the high intensity fights. I have a personal issue with the walking animation though, it looks like a 70s cartoon tiptoeing through a sea of lions."
Started playing it but I disliked the fact you can't move character more toward the bottom of the screen. It be much easier to fight enemies. Character is fixed just slightly above the middle screen which gives you little time to blast enemies. Fun good game but Sucks in camera position.
"Admiring the console level graphics and the refined gun sounds,lighting and all the tech going on in this game,haven't played it for long but,so far so very good. The reason of not giving it a 5 ⭐ is the camera angle,which is not much of a problem but I would rather have it in a bit lower angle....but great gaming touches in this app which is worth trying out."
"I like it so far, reminds me of the ""Alien Shooter"" PC games. Controls are a little clunky but work OK. I just wish it wasn't quite so zoomed in, the angle makes it difficult to see well. So far I haven't been slammed with ads so that's a nice bonus!"
"I like this I like it a lot...I gave it 4* because of a little thing but its not right. This game is excellent. Nice graphics, sound effects, gameplay. Dont need to spend your cash just play the game. Seriously if you looking for a fast paced shooter this is it. Levels start easy but get harder and harder but still easily accomplished."
Great game but extremely annoying moaning noises made by female character whenever she's damaged. It is very noticeable and loud Please add an option to reduce character speech volume. Good graphics and gameplay. Cool weapons.
"Its okay, I guess. It has the potential to evolve into a really good story based campaign, but I don't think the dev has any such plan. The gameplay is solid, but gets repetitive. Same environment, same enemies, just shoot 'em up. It will keep you entertained, but for how long will depend on you. Yes, I would recommend anyone to try this game."
"Ads are optional, gameplay is decent, level design could use more variation, use arrow on left to navigate to objectives and exit, use map top right to see threats outside if view on screen. Overall average difficulty in early stages once you figure out how to get from point to point as quickly as possible."
does this a beta version? it's totally potential but it seems unfinished project. i believe that Xenowerk has connection with Space Marshalls games. so this will be better if include more stories on every shaft plus people will be more curious about Space Marshalls that it's become a free ad. but please fix the camera and map movements. also add more features for upgrades especially on suit armor and combat effects. give arrow guidence to the target objects. fix also map interface
"I love this game so much. I actually downloaded this game for some time pass. But this game just sucked me in, now i cant stop playing. I like how this game manages the ads. But i agree with other reviews, that this game needs a Multiplayer Mode, if not multiplayer, give us a Lan Wifi mode, in which we have to shoot other players and be the last one, and it take upto 30 players or somewhat less at once. Thank you for this wonderful game."
The game is fantastic with a lot of shooting and the maps are awesome. I love the 3D movement of the character and the change of perspectives. The game could be improved a lot but change the effects while using different guns. The angle and the view could be improved aswell
Good Game! The Swivel joystick mechanics takes a bit time to master but is easily achievable!! Only disappointment is that there is no Story to it! Just going on killing those freaks through many levels! If u put a good Storyline to this game it would make this game more playable and add some animations whenever we touch the computer! and make more objects! destroyable! The Flower pot is literally unbreakable!! For now its just a good game! 5 stars if u add story to it and all these things above
"By far one of the best experiences I've had with a mobile game. It's a pretty cool game. My only issue is how repetitive the levels are with the layout, enemies and missions. And I really wish this game can have a co-op mode in the future. Overall, I had fun, extremely repetitive but, very fun"
how can i describe this game....all it is.. that every so often the level gets reapeated....but with more added levels....its not exactly mind blowing stuff... upgrading is no problem...and if you look at the gameplay.....the levels they are repeated every two to three levels later..... nothing changes...
"clearly a really well made game with beautifully crafted graphics. however, for me and I'm guessing others the main challenge in the game is controlling your character and not the gameplay. that's not how it should be."
"A marvellous game, offline, never requires app purchases and easy to play with its effective controls but there is a serious lack of storyline and some thrilling elements, you just spawn then and there when you die even the same missions bore you down soon enough. PVP mode, diiffrent styled Maps and enemies except mutants could also help."
"It's a great game, I mostly progress through the levels very quickly, which is personally my preference. However prior to installation, I expected this game to be more in tune with the horror genre, but it turned out to be more of a action shooter. Its worst flaw is inarguably the camera angle and movement mechanics which gives the game an awkward mechanic."
Love this game!! Really good graphics and great time killer. But i suggest to add multiplayer option to play with friends. Sometime it lags in some devices which i have seen and it needed some fix so please fix this bug and keep up the good work!!.
Pretty good like a low grade timesplitters minus the first person view more of like an angle shot 2d stlyle though ther is a camera corect button hardly use it but i can see how it might be important to some ...would be cool if you could choose a guy character not that it matters had to work the option menu to get the controls customized to my liking which is helpful it has that capability really like the sound controls as well has a nice atmosphere
"It's a great game with decent graphics, a healthy catalogue of weapons to choose from and monsters to kill. However, my only gripe will remain with the level design. The game is fun in the beginning but get's repeatitive after a while."
"The gameplay is fun, the game is immersive, the equipment is affordable and, yes the MT's are there but earning money and progressing is possible without them... The only draw back is the player camera, it makes aiming a rather tough job, it is a bit on the weird side but all in all, game is practically awesome."
"Excellent game . Some things should be enhanced like more weapons but less amount of money , guns , armours , I will give it 5 stars when u guys will add a multiplayer mode . The camera angle sometimes make it hard to play the game ...... Otherwise the game is very good and addictive ."
"Actually, this game turned out to be more interesting than I presumed. Controls are simple, making combat a breeze. The gear is has a very unique style to it. As well as the creatures. Overall a well designed game that doesn't require a connection."
"1. I hate that heal/haste/freeze/???/double-damage wheelie at the side, especially when mobs are swarming and you continuously miss that itsy-bitsy-tiny-little freeze icon to buy some time. Can't they just put them in a better way, maybe just icons below? 2. I love the gameplay, I just hope there was some story or something. Maybe you wanna show what a mercenary feels but nobody wanna be them. 3. Please put em little money and gears on the map so we can collect them later."
"What an instant blast! Literally @blast! I enjioyed this game from the start and especially when I adjusted the controls so that the D-pad was on the left side of the screen; once you fix it where you can run and gun its really fun mowing down the aliens. I find myself wishing the Fox movie franchise had done this earlier with a Ripley character. Oh well,this game makes me think its like if the movie ""Aliens"" had a baby with ""Baldurs Gate."" The graphics are nothing special but adequate enough."
"Great time killer, my only two issues with this game is there are no customization options for your character just armor upgrades and the map with it not having shaded areas to indicate that it not a path throws me off a little during gameplay. Besides that addicting game."
"Cool game for killing aliens. The gameplaya and graphics are awesome. However, it lacks the element of surprise, as you move on, the same species appear. Another thing I would like added to this game is the ability to try out the guns in the store."
"More of a proof of concept than a game. The animations and sounds are super satisfying, the difficulty of the game comes only from you trying to adjust your aim with the camera movement, everything else is repetitive. Worth trying out"
"The game has the potential to be one of the best mobile games, but you have to readjust the controls and the camera distance, the view is too short and suddenly you see the enemies in front of you which somehow frustrating and kill your planning for attack instinct."
"The game is very Good. Brillaint Gameplay and Graphics, only thing I suggest is the prices when it comes to buying better Armour and Weapons. Also I think you should add a Multiplayer player mode so u can play levels with your friends. If we can do that then I'll give it a 5 Star straight away."
A very fun game that isn't very easy. It has a nice idea that was executed well (well done devolpers) and has very basic controls. Overall a fun game that takes up almost no space on your phone that makes for a great past time.
"Works smoothly, nice graphics, easy controls. The only thing is that it starts to get repetitive after a while. Could use more features or gamemodes perhaps. Looking forward to future updates."
The gamd is very fun to play and you can play offline which is great. A bit repetitive but a good time killer. You can buy new guns which is quite interesting. Keep up the good work. The graphic also is very nice. Overall I recommend the game.
It's a good game. Easy to get into. Levels are short so you can pick it up and play anytime. And it is really free. No pay to win bs. Camera angles can be improved though. And also the environment. This game can be much better if the developers pay some attention to it. Still an enjoyable game.
The game is good. I mean I love it except that the camera is too near you can't see something coming from your front except when it's close.. the camera is supposed to be high in the sense that you can view the whole perimeter within.. Sometimes while playing I do get attacked suddenly cause I don't even see them coming cause of the camera closeness.. please try to improve it. Never the less it's a cool game 💯
"Ok so the game is really good but i have some suggestions. The camera feels weird and the button that readjust it doesnt help much. I feel like u should make separate buttons for changing guns , aiming amd shooting cuz with snipers it's kinda hard to hit (havent finished everything yet but just some suggestions that's all)"
"This game has potential to become a really good action shooting game so far this is the most refined and detailed game with smooth graphics and interactable environment, i hope you add more game modes like survival mode or skirmish rather than just the campain and also having unlimited ammo seems too op why not add an ammunition feature where the players have to collect ammos all around the map and also adding more objectives every round , great game so farr"
the game are great easy controls and ood graphics. the only thing that i THINK that its lacking is that the ability to zoom out the area. somehow. i look at the map more. this gives me difficulty on where to flee in case of bosses.
"Nice game, good visuals and optimization. But doesn't support 18:9 aspect ratio screens, if you've got a tall display then you'll have to get used to a huge black bar on one side of the screen."
"Pretty well made game. Reminds me of the Alien Shooter classic. Could use some new content though such as new Secret territories, Multiplayer Team Arena defense against waves of mutants/ giant boss and Event exclusive equipment. Some new mutant varieties would be a fresh thing. Would be fun if there is an auto-Turret slot or for players to use for firing assistance."
"Weird at first, once you learn the fluid controls it you can really mow down some aliens!! really needs more updates, definitely worth adding more stuff, only negative is the specials wheel, really temperamental on being able to press it to open and even if you do open it you dont end up pressing anything"
"Loved playing this game....but the only problem is that there is no progressive difficulty or variation in level design. It's same after the same except number of enemies and their health increases. Other than that, top marks for graphics and gun design."
Very nice game but the only problem is that at a point of time... The levels start lengthening alot as a way of making them harder...but in fact it makes the one level take so much time even if sometimes not even hard which makes it boring a bit
"This game might be one of the best in this store that outrightly justifies what it means to be a third person run' n gun. But desperately needs more variety in terms of missions, maps, features, and along with few new armors with weapons. Hopefully justifies actual narrational story telling in game which will actually make this even better. Yet, still gives me an actual sense of achievement when achieving high-end gear. Somehow needs more in touch with features while still being a great A-Lister"
The game is great but the abilities the way they r gotten I DNT like and it takes forever to get them then they degenerate after a while and the aiming is a little whack it's off when u aim like it takes a while then shoots over where u want it and it's not very precise like I should be able to make little movements but I can't the only thing it really responds to is bigger movements
"Controls are broken. When I press the fire button sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Please fix this developers. Otherwise it's a perfect game. Great story, graphics and action. So far. Four stars."
"Good, the flame thrower make me feels like I'm on aliens,con: it's hard to get used to the aiming and auto firing, instead of aiming the gun without firing towards where you're walking, this is more like walk back and still the aim is on the other direction but when you aim to where you're walking let say back or (down in this case) when you aim down (backwards) starts firing and wasting ammo, it should be a wider bigger area to aim and the fire just on the X"
Good game but the camera angle get in the way sometimes. The control is bad since there a lot of time where I accidentally switch weapon when I want to use a skill. Still it's fun to play and I watch a lot of in-game-ads since I don't have a lot of money to support the dev.
"Only played this game for a few minutes now but it seems great except for the camera view. I wish it would be static. But the commercial game is on point and kudos to the dev team for that. You wanna restart, np... you wanna respawn, watch a commercial. Makes sense to me."
"Pretty fun game to pass time. Though there are a few things that bother me. The story is not that interesting and it leads to repetitiveness. Also the fact that you have infinite ammo is kind of irritating, for me at least. But overall it's not half bad."
"this is a really good game, i just wish it had more content and we could choose the camera zoom. edit: after trying to reinstall the game to finish the last level, the game just doesn't download the additional content needed to play."
"I love the graphics of this game....simple controls...the gameplay is also good....map is not proper, it some times confucing.... otherwise everything is really good...And one more thing I like about this game is that provides free gems on watching ads.so you don't have to pay real money to buy gems or coins...hence you can buy all weapons as soon as possible by just watching the ads...."
Great game even though it is repetitive. The various upgrades and bonuses make the progress of the levels enjoyable. A stronger narrative delving into the protagonist's and commander's character would make the experience more immersive.
"This is the best mobile game ever created. I am a big fan of the Dead Trigger series and Unkilled. The upgrading system is perfect. The campaign is awesome but it is quite short. There is a wide variety of many weapons you can craft, upgrade, and choose. The only thing is that sometimes the game starts getting laggy and then freezes but it rarely happens. GREAT GAME!"
"Been playing on and off since the first cities to be saved. The game is fast paced, with a slightly grind-y side to it. Hoping to see more unlockables/upgrades and maps added to the game. The only thing that truly bugs me about the game is the pop-up ads for the shop/giveaways that could just be kept in the mailbox, and the Tapjoy offer screen disables all in-game audio, regardless of wearing headphones or not."
"Been playing for a while now and keep coming back. The enemies are repetitive, but the enviroments do change some. My biggest complaint is the controls freeze occasionally for no apparent reason, but not as bad as in the past. This usually means you lose significant health and at times your player's death. You have a choice to use gold to revive or end the game and restart which is a pita! Overall I really like this game and is one I try to play daily. Give it a try, I think you'll like it!"
"I would rate this a 5 stars, because honestly it IS an amazing game...however the ONE issue I have is when I'm trying to do the x3 daily challenge and I have to use the sky bomb drop thing...every single time I go to play it, I get a few bombs in and the game just completely crashes and kicks me out. And it will NOT allow me to complete the level...it let's me play everything else which is great and all but that is an important part of what I look forward to when I go to play this game. PLEASE FIX THIS!!! I will change my rating to 5 stars if so."
"My hats off to MADFINGER GAMES. All of their games are outstanding. Great gameplay, gorgeous graphics, excellent selection in weapons. The difficulty ranges from fast- paced and challenging to insane and nearly impossible to survive. My only complaint is:it becomes almost impossible to progress without spending real money to get bigger/better guns or to upgrade the ones you have. This is common with all free games. The game devs have to make a living, folks, so i can't hold it against them."
"The ads. I feel very drawn to exit out of the app after every mission, when an unskippable ad plays almost longer than how long the last mission was. I like the arcade gameplay and I think that more blueprints could be dropped. Also find a better placement for ads. Even if that means making the missions more exciting or longer. I would happily watch an ad then."
"Very good in part and very frustrating. No new missions have been added in years. Very easy to control, even on a phone. Takes too long to build or update a weapon or technician, sometimes several days. Wish I could sell unused items back. Don't need to spend $$$ if you don't want to, just a video or 2 every now and then. Remember, the Benelli shothgun is your best friend."
"Great graphics and great controls, but the game needs a little work to make it more playable. Like the prices for weapons and the amount of time it takes to upgrade something. It takes literally like 48 hours! Thats ridiculously long! It should upgrade instantly or atleast within an hour or so. It also needs more survival maps and different missions and more locations to play in. Other than this, its a great game! One more thing, zombies take too many bullets to kill in survival mode. 4stars ty"
"Great, especially for a free game! Wish the regular story game wasn't so short though and that the timer was accurate for when you finish missions with 3 seconds or less to go; if there's less than 3 seconds left on the clock when you finish a mission, it counts it as a fail, even though the mission was technically finished on time."
"graphics are nothing short of amazing, on high 60fps (of course.) But one thing I have to point out is that you walk as slow as a crawling Z in the middle of all hell, like ""yeah sure just let me casually walk over there with 100+ zombies behind my back."" Please make running a normal mechanic, not a pay-to-use mechanic. It does not change the difficulty a whole lot, and you've already done it once with Shadowgun Legends."
Love this game. Blew the first game away. Usually the 2 game is just like the first or its even worse but you guys did it . Super fun. The time you have to wait for upgrades at times is a bit much tho. Only complaint I got sucks to save 150000 coins to upgrade a gun but it takes 3 weeks to make it. Haha. Not quite but you get the drift. Thanks for your time
"It's probably one of the better zombie games that I've played but the blueprint system is a little frustrating at times cause I can kill around 10 bosses (vomitron, scienfists, ragers, panzers, and kamakazy) and not get a single one and then next mission get two in a row. This is frustrating because of how many different guns there are that I'd love to try and see how far I can get but I can't access many but maybe 5 to 6. If there's anything I'd change it's making them a little more consistent"
"By far the best zombie shooter on the mobile platform! No other zombie game even comes close to this! Ive played since it came out and my only real complaints are that the controls aren't always responsive and that unlike the first dead trigger, you can't just buy and upgrade the weapons. You need blueprints and you need to upgrade your tech. You also need to continuously purchase auto heal instead of buying it once. If you fix these aspects of the game, my review will go to a 5!"
Really great fun game. I was just disapointed that I beat the story mode unknowingly. I had just started getting better guns. This game should have been more challenging with bosses near the end of each level. It was rather unerwhelming. Hopefully they update it with more mini games or make a Dead Trigger 3 with way more bosses and harder challenges.
"This a damn good game that has a mechanic fans of Final Fantasy VIII will notice, if you level up, so will your enemies! A bit repetitive in some areas of the game, but the environment is usually always different, awesome assortments of zombies await you at every turn, some even run at you😬, but unless you have max level assault rifles, Shot Guns and a very fast Melee, as well as lots of strong healing, stay out of the arena even if it's required as the zombies are all Max Level and your not..."
"This is quite literally the best mobile game out there. This would look normal on a Switch, and if it got a graphical update going onto a Switch/any other console, it'd look stunning. However, I wish there was more to the story, as it seems relatively short, not including the 20 minute wait in between story stages. I'm hoping I see this on the Switch Eshop, 'cause it'd be amazing."
"VERY good graphics, decent (thus far) story, easy to grapple with mechanics and movement control, solid bonuses WITHOUT the demand of spending real money... I give it a 4 because honestly a 5 would be perfect and there is hardly an app out there that is 100% zero flaws and perfect, but I'd give this one a 4.5 if I could. If you like zombie shooters that dont feel like a linear arcade game, give this one a go. You wont be dissatisfied."
"It has good gameplay and good storyline, but where you are supposed to snipe the zombies from the rooftop, there is no button there to shoot the rifle. If you can soon, please fix this as I am looking forward to playing the game but I can't get past this one level. Dev, please fix this and I will change this to a five star. Thanks!"
"Honestly one of the best zombie games out there. Yes, one of the best mobile, but also one of the best zombie games in general. Game runs smoothly, modes are awesome, designs, graphics, controls, the whole thing is awesome. Like a console game. But that pineapple event was so short. I spent $5.99 in extra support to get the Brain Washer and Sunflower and why can't I just HAVE the paddle for spending as much as I did? There should have been a depending price range of if you get all three or not."
"While this is the most fun mobile game of its kind there are 2 big flaws in the game. The 1st is the idiotic auto reload which always seems to activate when I have a target in my sights and with over half a clip left - Devs can we have the option to replace the hardly-ever-used zoom button with a manual reload? The other downside is the campaign is too short, should be double the length. All that said there's a lot of fun to be had here, a game I would definitely recommend."
"One of the best zombie shooter games I've ever played. In fact, it's far more refreshing compared to Dead Trigger 1 and the gameplay is still as amazing as that game. Even the melee combat is so satisfying as hell that I've enjoyed slicing and beating up those zombies with my Wrench (it's your first weapon, though) and Machete, it's really getting even better. However, while the story is at least ok, the main weakness here is that an Internet connection is needed to play."
It is sad that the game is online Only but it is still very fun. There are a lot of quests to do and the gameplay is tight. The audio does break when you launch it and the shop shows up but it is fixed once you disconnect and reconnect your Bluetooth earbuds. It works fine on earphones.
"Hi. While I'm in main menu (hideout) my game is not full screen. There are big black borders two sides of the game screen (Left and right sides to be exact). Please fix this. There are several parts of the game that have this state. I also have this problem with your other game, Unkilled. Also I have the ""game gets muted"" problem others mentioned and no i'm not using a bluethooth device."
"Fair Game. It takes 20 mins before another story stages opens which will keep players not to be bored easily while reaching the end game. Not to mention collecting blueprints system of items and weapons. there are a lots of modes you can play. Operation,Assault ,Defense mode , Seek and Destroy including arena rank survival and tournaments. .Hope there will be enemy soldiers too. Theres an adding friend system but why no coop?"
"This game is just perfect, the story gets better and better each missions, I like the voice lines they're cool, and the daily missions and the combat this game is just simply perfect, but it's hard to get new guns so it makes ur Boring and when you upgrade your gun it would drain a lot of your coins leaving you broke, the 20 minutes between every missions get the hype out of me tbh like make it 15 minutes if you complete it on medium and 10 on hard, overall this game is perfect other than issues"
"Finished the Campaign 2 years ago, good memories.Now still no new missions. Please, why do I need to wait weeks for upgrades, grinding beyond tech 5( I am 8 now)for no Campaign missions, same zombies, etc.I apreciate the new daily missions that u get(with infected chicken, mortar etc.)But please Put new Campaign missions, new zombies/Bosses etc.Same as others that finished the game, we like to see where the story can go beyond flooding the Black Coats Base.Thank you good luck in your journey ^_^"
"Please help, I got logged out of my game and don't remember my login. I have spent so much money on this game and do not want to loose all my weapons. 🙏 PLEASE HELP 🙏 This is such a great fantastic game, I've been hooked for about 2 years now. An all around fun zombie killing game with tons of weapons and originality! 5 🌟 if I can get my account recovered!"
"I love zombie games and this one is pretty fun. However, one thing that doesn't make this 5 stars is collecting the blueprints to unlock new weapons. Three days ago I was playing the arena to finish getting the last two blueprint pieces I needed for the M16 and I got to round 35 and I got stuck in a glitch and had to close the app. I lost everything I have earned which was pretty frustrating. I'm level 20 and I only have three guns. There should be an option to buy the weapons with money earned."
"I like this game so much!💝 But after this recent update, there is a bug! Game screen freezes after completing the mission.. It's not getting back to the game, have to close the app! Please fix this issue.!🙏🏽 Like to play the game 🎮"
Everything is okay and i have played this game once except the fact I never completed it. But bow that I have downloaded it again I'm always running into a problem where after I complete a mission the game is just stuck at the loading screen so maybe do something about it cuz I can't progress anymore. I'll try reinstalling
It's overall a good game.. even the levels go on like a story of sorts.. i have like one issue.. the Russia leg is not showing any levels for me.. i don't know if it's undergoing some update or any other reason.. kindly fix this
This is a very enjoyable old school FPS that handles very well on the mobile. The game does not seem to be to overly pay for play but does have some stuff that requires purchase. The only reason I gave it four stars was it was tagged as offline also and as of a few weeks in the game that is one thing it does not keep it's promise in. Besides that sit back and enjoy a fine zombie shooting game
"The overall game is good. Graphics , controls , animations they are excellent. Now why I give it 4 stars. It is because of the tutorials. They appear in every level and it is okay because you have to tell us what to in that level but the problem is the size and the position of that tutorials. It appears in middle of the screen which is very annoying. Fix this, just make them smaller and in side of the screen."
"Been playing this game for years and I still think this is one of the best mobile fps you could find, but the graphics really showed its age and I hope that the devs can ramp it up to match with current mobile games' graphics standards. There's still an issue where the loading screen freezes after completing a mission, it's really frustating because I am forced to restart the game and play the mission again."
"Honestly I like the game, everything is great but one thing, you shouldn't have to wait 20 mins for a every single campaign mission, 1 campaign mission last 30s to 2 mins, and you have to wait 20 mins, honestly, I think you should take that wait time out, I'm sure other players are annoyed with that aswell. Also, wait time to build the hideout.That's the only thing that is blocking me from giving you 5 stars to be honest. The rest of the game is excellent. Graphics excellent, gameplay excellent."
"Game is fun, but I'm stuck in the final mission for the Africa campaign because the game returns me to the main menu each time I finish it. My internet connection is stable, and I've been repeating this level three times now."
This is a very good game but after some mission it gets stuck on the loading screen with guns and gunsman it is very annoying . Please look forward to this matter I would be very happy :))
"This is one of my favourite shooter zombie game, the graphics are good the visuals are good and really great zombie game I like Dead Trigger 1 instead because it's just classic and one problem is that the zombies sometime deals damage with out even touching the player, nothing else 😁"
This game is so so fun!it's not like the other games at all the graphics and storyline is so good but sometimes it crashes and it also said it's offline but it's not the others it's pure fun! (can you guys make it offline so everyone who downloaded this is gonna have fun without internet)
I was begginer in this game but it is really good but sometimes after a mission my screen got stuck on loading and I can't do anything please fix this graphic are not that good but we can compromise and this game is also multiplayer thanks for this feature
"One of the best zombie games, love the graphics and the gun upgrades, would really love some more missions added, has been a long time waiting!!"
"I really like the game ive been playing for almost six years now the campaign is not so bad not so good either i like that its very forward about the action. recently in this new 3x mission specifically the mortar shooting one, the hands is really oily in higher graphics it feels off, and sometimes i just turn my graphics to low it removes the weird oily hands and its way better looking at it, i dont know why it is, but please tone it down a bit it really feels off."
"Fantastic zombie game for mobile devices it controls nicely they're responsive and the graphics are pretty good for mobile my only complaint is the slot machine, not a fan of those but other than that it's pretty good"
Where is my gun. Bought a gun. Played the game had fun upgraded it. Had some more fun. Had some extra in game cash so bought a new gun. I can spend more in game cash upgrading it but it isn't available to select as one of my weapons. Gimme the weapon.
Its good to play great and also graphics its all amazing but i have some suggestion. 1 If anyone buy the guns that don't complete blueprint. Auto build no need to build i mean not people rich that after you buy it with gold you need to build money please change to past 2. Fast farming blueprint too and money thats all. Also about loading screen plase fix that bug it's really dissapointing and im a little angry about it. I'll make 5 star if that bug fixed. Thanks.
It's a great game however during gameplay I encountered glitches like when a zombie gets on another zombie that zombie that is being pushed will move at insane speeds and also grenades will only kill the impacted zombie but nearby zombies only get damaged even if there really close to the explosion but overall it's a good game
"Hello, I'd like to file a bug, everytime that free gold screen pops out, it breaks the audio and has no sound. Please fix this bug"
Dear David This is one of my favorite games. I've been playing for years now on and off. There was the audio issue that I managed to fix by changing accounts. It worked for a while but it happened again. Ples fix Sensearly A fan Update because after update the game no longer works. Please fix
"Fantastic zombie game. The only qualm I have is the story mode. Please update the story mode for the remaining regions. I've reached Russia and was shocked to find no story mode after waiting 2 days. In fact, all of the regions have a ""not yet"" status for the story mode. Please update this. That aside, great game. 8/10"
I just started playing and its good the grind is enjoyable and the upgrading system is ok.Minor suggestion a little somethin in the store now and again would be nice and probably some new mission types might keep the gameplay fresh jus some thoughts but its good so far.
"Sometimes when I finish a mission, the loading screen will be stuck. Please fix this bug and I will give you 5 stars."
Better then any game I played on mobile and I played alot of them this the best zombie game to me and I always put it on hard mode it's awesome for a 15 kid like me that plays games 24/7 if you want your game played just give me news and I got you 🥱🤎🤎🤎
Please notice this⚠️ the game is having some glitches the audio of the game goes off quickly and atleast one mission so far is also not working when I shot explosives is doing no damage at all to the zombies
Although this game is really good we need more campaign levels. After you get to south America the campaign does not continue I would love to see a russia Antarctica and Australia campaign. Besides that this game is amazing
Game is best but it takes too much time to open guns. I am in tech level 6 and level 25 I have only 2 Guns I can't get more blueprint. It's very bad
This game is very good but one problem is that when you complete missions the game didn't go to home due to which we have to close the game and reopen it and again do the mission
"It's a good game actually.but about the upgrade somehow is to long and need Alot of money,too. I still don't where can I buy weapons and guns."
I like the game very much but it will be more easier if you make the game offline so that every player can easily play this game so I have rated it 4 stars and but if you accept my request then I will surely rate it 5 stars . Plz accept my request
"Pretty good. Tech upgrades way too expensive. Please fix the following bug: when I customize the HUD and place the fire button on the left side, it randomly places itself on the right side. Also, sometimes i can't move the camera; there is no sound when connected to Samsung Galaxy Buds2."
One of the best zombie shooters on mobile. This game is amazing the bosses are great I also love the minibosses like the kamikaze they spice your normal machines up by a notch cause you don't know when their coming. Overall great game but it has issues. The game has very bad story progression or it's just my simple opinion but once you finish the missions of one region you have to pay the scientist a fat stack of cash to go to the next region I personally hate this. Overall I recommend.
"This is one of my favorite FPS zombie shooters in the app store, why 4 stars though? The game crashes by random chance in a loading screen after completing any mission, and loses any recent progress, fix this anamoly ASAP, please, without this bug game would be easy 5 stars"
"I like the game but there's a particular mission in African Campaign called ""Scientific Peek"" wherein after finishing the quest, the loading screen took so long or it's stuck there. I reopened the app and then I need to play that mission again. I hope you can fix this."
The game is fun plenty of things to do. A bit money-based. But overall well balanced game.
This is actually a really good game! Most of the zombie shooters i play are garbage. But as i'm speaking this game only has 50+ million downloads at the time i'm speaking. Even though their game lied about having 110 mil downloads. But overall the thing that bugs me the most is that you have to wait for levels. GET RID OF THAT.
"I love the game but the way of getting gold is no there at all. You can only get it by doing everyday task , watching videos. I'm a free to win player and please add more quest like weekly, monthly etc.etc. Also like daily 2x,3x make gold ones too."
This is most fun I am all day and every day I play this game i can try to unlock every waepon and kill every bosses but I need very time but this game have every time ads i am so editet but I like this game this game is so big story and grafix is most best
I personally like this game because it's better than most mobile zombie games. I also like this game because there are no forced ads.
If you are finding a game like doom This is it the perfect game i have been looking for The reason why i gave it 4 stars is that it has no offline mode and the text is in the center of screen and we cant even change that please fix this 2 problems and this app gets 5 star by everyone
"This game is fun to play, the shooting system is well done, the controls are user friendly and there is a good variety of weapons to obtain. The only thing is the weapon blueprints gained from completing missions and tasks disappear after a certain amount of time it would be better if you keep that which you collected until you use them."
"Game mutes sound after the gold offer wall pops up when loading the game, other than not being able to hear anything it's a great game"
Sound problem in my device all mute automatically don't know why. After login sound is on then some add pop up then all mute. No sound after all???
"why is there words in gigantic white letters across the screen to tell me in the middle of me aiming at a zombie? put it above the target not smack dab in the middle where nobody can see. also if I get a part of a blueprint for an item why does it stop the game to tell me? like that's irritating af, it knocks you out of game mode for something that is seriously unnecessary. if I only got 1 piece out of 4 them it doesn't matter that I know yet, even if I did get 4 don't stop the game to tell me."
"I've written an okay review on this game before and now the stairs glitch isn't happening anymore so now the game is really enjoyable. That's all I have to say but I feel like there can be more weapons and some way to add multiplayer missions but other than that, well done MADFINGER Games😄👍🏻"
Its a great game to have. The graphics are okay and i think you all should try it if your this kinda game fan .
I love this game but every time any kind of pop up happens the sound shuts all the way off until I shut it down and restart it
Five stars if the upgrades are completed much quicker. Otherwise its an enjoyable game.
Just started playing this game yesterday and it's very hard to put down. Great graphics and easy to use controls and directions. I'm sure it will get harder as I progress but it's really a cool game to play
Overall game is nice but whenever ad comes game the sound of game stops coming I tried restarting game but still it was not working solve this problem
"Best and nostalgic game. Used to play it when I was 13 on my grandpa's ipad. But when I finish the match, I am stuck at loading screen. And it didn't save progress. Please fix this."
This game is epic with high graphics but the problem is that if I played a game then next will be started after a few minutes
"It's fun and lots of action. Missions aren't crazy difficult, and upgrading equipment is achievable(not crazy expensive). The adds aren't intrusive, the slot machine took care of that, well done. Only downside is the crazy long time it takes for upgrades to be finished. I upgrade and then close the game and play something else the rest of the day."
"It is a good game but, unfortunately, once the story mode ends, it becomes a little bit boring. I mean, ok it has the tournaments, the arena and some same missions to liberate cities but, other than that, I think it becomes a little bit repetitive. It has good graphics, not like some of the latest games that have come out, but for its age is rather competitive."
"Probably one of the best zombie shooting games I've played. The campaign is very good but the story is way to short. Could do with an update to add on to the campaign mode. The biggest problem with this game is the build time, 2 days to build certain weapons and now 3 days to build the next area when the story has finished is a bit of a joke to be honest and needs looking at. Apart from that it is a very good game"
"Easy to play game with good graphics and good weapon availability. You can get far in missions without spending money for gold- which is great. Only thing I don't like, is you have to wait days just to upgrade a weapon, or your overall tech level. Like 7 days sometimes, just to upgrade a weapon to next level. Also, not a great thing is that it is hard to get a blueprint for weapons in the game. Sometimes you have to play for an hour just to get blueprint, good game tho..."
"The game is pretty good. The graphics, as you have promised us, is also good. The only thing that is annoying is that bug where if you finish a level in story mode, you load, and load, and keep loading and it takes forever to load. That, make no mistake, is annoying. Buy while you can cope with it by closing the game and opening it, the level progress resets, making it even more annoying. It is my kind request to fix this bug.."
"Crashing has been fixed! I've upgraded my save all the way to Tech Level 10, and I'm still enjoying the game. My only complaint is that the timers later on can get very long. It can be planned for, so don't worry about this game being p2w. This is one of the longest living games on the Playstore for a reason. It's fun, there's a little bit of strategy with gear choices, and a great amount of skill if you wish to push the arena mode."
I have a bug if you join the game It shows you a menu with a coin When you close the menu The noise and music stopped please fix it
It's a good game. Full starts from me if you could please fix the layout customisation. I cannot bring the trigger button on the left side of the screen. After I click customise it shows that I can but during gameplay the trigger button stays on right itself. Please fix this as some people want to aim and shoot at the same time and that is not possible if controls for both are on the same side. I want to bring the trigger button on the left of the screen above the movement floating butting
"It starts off pretty good, levelling up tech opens up new levels, abit frustrating having to wait 20minutes for the next mission to open, even more frustrating is opening up a new area and not having any missions to do, so you have the option to keep replaying same missions(boring) or spend money to level up weapons and tech level. If you haven't got deep pockets, give it 2 weeks and the gameplay is very repetitive."
To me this game is really interesting to play so much action packed .gun lovers this is the game just watchout for the zombies
"No trriger!!! Second time installing the game on my phone and the same problem, no trigger no way to shoot in sentinel missions I used to love this game and now I can't play it anymore Edit: a developer contacted me and showed me how to solve the issue, the game now works fine."
"The best game, but sort of wish its offline for upgrade. But it's fine the way it is. The graphic is stunning, I assume it's not only to impress your players but you enjoy of what you do and create as the maps expands. I been playing Dead trigger original long enough to get bored of, even this version has abit some issues. So no matter what I'm trying to say. It's hard to find a good offline FPS game. But this is no doubt best for the performance, graphics, and gameplay, and it's free to play..."
It is a really good game but if you are 8 or under do not play this it has a lot and a lot of violence But I love this game really good one
"A good shooting game among many. I like that there is no ""energy"" system to keep playing. I like the gameplay, the weapons, the mission designs, and the upgrade system, with only painful area that the upgrades take painfully long but that is understood that it's required for gold sale purposes. But there is only problem, game lags or freezes even if there is a slight ping of network fluctuation. Lost achievements & good rewards as missions don't complete. Please improve that. Offline mode pls."
"Bruh,very good game but We need an update.Dear Madfinger Games,pls add more campaigns and more areas and also add new bosses.Also fix the glitches and bugs of zombies and bosses.By the way i like the graphics and control system.pls gave us update.🙏"
"Excellent customer support, very little down side w/r the game. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it now can not be played via FB or via a web browser."
"Game is awesome but I have some problem now.Tech level 7and campaign 15 finish but I will not found campaign 16 and disappearance tech level 6 zone from the world map, so please fix this my account name is jOhnwickx31."
"Really like the game. It was fun, entertaining, plus the controls are smooth. Didn't really had that much problem with it, plus there's no add that constantly pops up like in other free game. The reason why I'm giving it a four star is because I wish the main campaign was longer and the story didn't end abruptly like it did. The story is good, it can be more enjoyable with a few more tweaking here and there. Hopefully you guys would add more story into the game in the near future :D"
"Now, this is a good game overall, Graphics look like they're from PS4, Gameplay is Amazing. But for some reason, everytime I complete a chapter, on the loading screen, it freezes. I am actually able to go to the next chapter, but I have to restart the game all over again and then play the previous chapter, then I can play again. This process just goes on and on and on. So pls fix this, I don't want to play this great game like this."
"I'm not usually into mobile first person shooters, mainly due to the non-intuitive and awkward controls involved. However, this was not the case here, the controls were fluid, intuitive and bafflingly easy to pick up. This genre of game is to my taste, but if it is yours, then give it go. The controls alone are a triumph for the mobile gaming community."
"I love the game, I always have and always will, I even watch an ad every level to support the staff so we get more like this and ITD2! Problem is that I haven't played in a while, and before my break, the touch controls always worked great, but now, some months later and they don't. It almost never turns, OR it fires incorrectly when I should turn, I die much sooner than I should. Some update changed and it doesn't work right anymore. I still love the game so don't get me wrong but I'm annoyed."
"This is actually not what I was expecting. It's a running game like Subway surfers, but you are avoiding Zombies and other obstacles. I assume its endless, but honestly, it was too easy, and got repetitive, HOWEVER, I really like the fact that it did something new, and was unique, not just another half-assed Zombie game. I really like the graphics and layout of the menu and everything, so overall, not bad, was a bit refreshing, so, yea, give it a try I suppose."
"NOT RUN OF THE MILL!!! so I like that the most! The steering is a little vague, as is the generalized crosshair (guess where youre about to shoot) for whatever weapon your using. But the weapons are awesome, the graphics are well done, the companion is awesome, the way you can hear the zombies being ripped apart as you pass him running against an insane herd of undead obstacles. Cool with me! I love going out with my manstopper and killing some brain eaters while I simultaniously kill time! 4*"
"This game is by no means the epitome of mobile gaming. It's more of a time passer. It's repetitive and simple and the gameplay is pretty linear. That being said, it's a really great time passer. The weapons and are diverse and fun to use. The pets are useful. The gameplay is balanced and the gamemodes require you to apply different strategies. The only problem with the game are the microtransactions, which disallow you from having a better and more diverse arsenal. Other than that, great game."
"Game is good in my opinion. Alittle different than what I'm used to in these types as far as the constant running. But I found it to be very fun juking my way thru the crowd of zombies, I love a good ole stealth game. Graphics r good, online challenges r abit easy though, how about 50,000m or 100,000m overall challenges,kill 75,000 zombies tasks."
"Alr pik pok, I am really sorry to say this but, the new update has made the game unplayable for me with all the graphic design its way to much it lags the game hard and its annoying to play. I've been playing this game for 7 years and I wish this couldn't have happened, I guess I will delete the game or try it on another device. I'm not sure if this is happening to anyone else. Some advice pik pok is you may want to get rid of the new graphics, don't have to just saying."
"This game is quite good. But it's a linear type of game. The game is too simple. So, I would request you to spend some of your valuable time to make this game a little more interesting for us. Like story mode in where we could play as this carecter's story before the plane crash. And by the way the graphics was marvelous. Thank you very much."
I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for one complaint. You can't restore you're progress if you reinstall the app. You can restore your purchases for the guns you can buy which are reasonably priced. That is the only bad point with this game otherwise it's a great time killer
"Best zombie game I've ever played, good graphics, physics and others, but you guys could enhance it by making the character able to escape a zombie when caught just like ""into the dead2"". Well its a really nice game, y'all tried👍"
"An amazing game! I love it you know the last time i played a game like this was about 4 years ago amd i didn't feel like exploring this genre again amd i was a little skeptical but i love the graphics,controls and gameplay.Its pretty addicting aswell and you can play it anytime 😋 BTW i would be sure to check out Into the dead 2 after i have enjoyed this one to the fullest Keep up the good work😁"
"strangely addictive. the options available to control chracter through the levels is very unique. and adds replay ability to the game. they are many things it lacks. however, it so worth spending a few hours and a few bucks. i think its time to download part 2."
"I recommend going with ""tilt mode"" for controls as I've had some issues with the responsiveness of tapping. Oh and if I'm not careful enough about tilting I might accidently minimize the game by mistake. Aside from that and the insidious facebook related ads & excess bothering about ""sharing your score on facebook"" , it's a pretty fun game overall."
"The game is fun overall but it gets a bit reppetative once you get the hang of it. I used to play this game when I was 9 and found it really easy. I'm not sure if it's meant to be scary or not because when u die u don't see any zombies or anything, there's no jump scares and u can see the zombies for miles because there eyes light up so I wouldn't rate this game pegi 16 I would probably give it 12. I think everyone is focused on the latest version of the game to much. I like this one better."
"its a great game, but jesus it is scary. the sheer amount of blood and gore you see just because you got ran over by a zombie, leading to a horde turning you into an all-you-can-eat-buffete. besides that, it also gets low-key sad, considering if you had a companion with you, when you died, you could also hear the some of the zombies going after it as well, and succeeding. over all, though, its a great time-killer and thriller, but not the game someone as timid as me would want to play."
"Overall it's an ok game. Simple to play, controls are pretty easy, graphics are decent but nothing special. Probably the best part of this game is that you dont have to make purchases to progress. I would've given this 3 stars but that alone gets it an extra star."
"Great game, but I play it on TV and I've unlocked all the guns. But my TV has run into some problem and I have to factory reset it. I can't find any way to sync my progress to another device. I seriously don't want to lose my progress. Can there PLEASE be any way to connect to google play games and get my progress on phone? That would be great."
"Like the game, like the developer, but the prices are pretty overboard, especially since gaining access to them is sporadic. Fun & there's always a challenge to strive for which keeps you motivated. Well worth a try & worth trying out some of their other releases also, good developer."
Very very fun. The daily trails are a good way to try out exclusive weapons and dogs and the weaponry is pretty satisfying too. My only real complaint is that the grenade and impact of weapons don't have an Oomph feeling to it. If there were more better sound effects for weapons or at least show the zombies acthally taking the bullets hard then it'll be more fun. Still though 8/10
The game graphics are damn good but the main problem is that it say's to play with the controller and also we can't change. Is that a glitch or its permanent. I wanted to play it without controller. Cause I don't have any controller. ThankYou
"This game is so great. I love how you can get all sorts of weapons and play cool game modes. The bad thing is that it's a little difficult to move. It's kinda slow when you try to go to the left/right. Especially when there's a heap of zombies Infront of you. other than that, really good game. 4/5. 😃"
"The game itself is very fun and addictive, but unfortunatley the touch controls dont work on the right side of my screen and it also happened with my previous device, which forces me to play only with the tilt controls, pleade fix it, I have seen other people with the same problem in the reviews."
i give it a 4 star review because: the game is AWESOME. ITS JUST EPIC! But... it is not as realistic as i expected it to be and there are bugs such as stopping and not being able to move or dying from a far distance.
"It was fun but for some reason, my control scheme displays the controller layout. So I can't select tilt, touchpad or the joystick. Is this an issue with the game or my phone because I can only move tapping on very specific areas of my screen 😥"
This game is pretty good we've all of the weapons and the dogs that can help you. You can make the game better by having multiplayer. But the graphics are very good and it will be good if you can customise your person. Like adding different shoes I like this game and I hope the developers put more stuff into the game
Good game. Initially you feel it bit difficult but soon you will like the game. First try to run simple then collect arms. You will love this game once you keep trying it. The games must have alternatives levels in short distance so that players have a continuous interest. This game has a capacity to suceed over temple run and subway surfers.
I usually don't give four five stars to any game or app but. there are so many ģood thing about this game platform that I can't just pick one. So my top three are . 1 multiple storylines and levels with excellent quality dialog. 2 the game play interlace isn't too overly difficult so its easy to immerse your self into the game. 3 the game gives you a good diversity of weapons and companions to assist you from dogs- other people to bangal tiger's . 4 the games excellent fun
"addictive zombie killing game , you have to stay alive for as long as you can by dodging the zombies , picking up weapons to kill the zombies , you can upgrade your weapons and even have a dog companion ,change the look of your zombies but this may mean in app purchases . the longer you stay alive the more points you earn , the more zombies you kill the more points you earn then you can turn your points into upgrades , i do wish though you could choose locations like a prison,a town etc"
"I really love this game! it's very fun and addicting, it kills alot of time I would give this a 5 stars but the controlling is a bit hard. Can you also make the dog save you? if you get caught by one can the dog please save you? you should also find a dog near 1k or 2k so it can be easier to fight of the zombies since there is a lot! I really love this game 9/10 friends reccomend... 😊"
"Exceptional graphics even for phones with low space and a low ram . Easy to play and learn yet challenging the further you go . If you're reading this review then I suggest you give this game a quick trial run. You'll most likely become a fanatic like me ...if not , what have you lost ?"
"Holy Moly, Amazing Graphics, amazing story, amazing...amazing....amazing. Just one thing is off. The Controls On Mobile are hard to Deal with. I'm sure this affects Gameplay and hope this issue will be gone in the next couple of weeks."
Run games are always fun to me! I like the control method options and haven't had any trouble the 1st day so hopefully nothing bugs me too much although the 30 second adds you cant skip do get a lil annoying 😅 but besides that it is a great game!! Love it👍
I really love this game but the only reason why I gave it four stars is because sometimes when im trying to shoot or kill a zombie and i tap on the screen it doesn't work and sometimes my character runs straight through a tree and causes me to die from the zombie behind the tree i don't know if this is happening to anyone else well anyway thanks for reading this and making such a great game
"Very simple yet pretty fun,but there is a bug with the chainsaw that has caused me to die several times,the chainsaw has 4 uses normally,but often when I use it till it should have 1 use left,it magically becomes empty even tho I didn't use it.It pretty much counts like it has 3 uses,it wouldn't be such a bad bug if I didn't die because of it."
Great game. Downloaded again becuse of new phone and still my progress didnt load. So now i must start all over. I had purchased the football team. And almost unlocked all the weapons. Wish there was a way to save. And when i push restore purchases it does nothing.
this app is great fun. it doesnt require wifi so its great for trips. there are only two bugs that can be anoying but over all they rarely happen. this game has lots of new weapons to unlock so you never fell bored. my only real complaint is that its slightly anoying to play on wifi because of ads
It's very good but I faced a problem in my run infinite ammo my guns suddenly didn't run out of bullets or reload it was kinda fun at first but i logged out of the app to not cheat the bug for the leader board still great good details good items good models and graphics.
"Best game but 4 stars because the control stops working, Minor glitches and bugs etc. are there but they are not a very big problem..There should also be an option which makes the game without blood and those things because sometimes people may get scared and its very nice game..Thank you"
"It's a good game, it doesn't have force ads. The only problem is that touch control is not working properly, I was tapping my right so that it fires the gun but its not firing and there's a zombie right infront of me."
For me the zombie game was to kill them but this game changed the definition... Nice game really good but I fell the game is limited... The graphics are awesome but you just have to do the same and same thing over and over and u get bored.. overall initially it's a very addictive game ....
"Need more development, need more guns, graphics is good, accuracy of gun is little accurate, more maps should be added, like snow, desert, grassland, etc. Unable to make purchases items as it does not have option like Google pay."
"Fantastic game, graphics are depot on. Lags a bit when dodging between zombies. Been playing several years on different devices. Suggestion maybe add a story line to it or a free adventure mode"
Its a classic and I appreciate the improvements. Side to side shifting need to be smoother with less reach from the dead... Make the running on this as as good as the 2nd one but endless. Thanks
Great Game: What Earns Respect Pros: Addictive Fun Fulfilling Awesome Features: Keep Players Hooked There are NFL and Nazi Themed Zombies! There are plenty of weapons to kill with and earn over time. You can compete globally with other players. Cons: Reason for Only 4 Stars Advertising; (Long Repetitive Unskippable Ads.) Exclusive In-Game Purchases; (No way to earn some items.
Ive been playing for a bit and the game is great. Only reason I gave it four stars is because it kept glitching out after a run and was not saving what I completed mission wise. If this is fixed then I'll give it five stars for sure.
Pretty good so far. Controls are not complex at all. Only gripe I have is that the movement is too stiff and aim is slightly inaccurate. Overall though I like this game a lot.
"A solid zombie runner unique out of the many I've played it has a lot of microtransactions but if you grind the game out enough you can unlock many weapons they're are many trials that let you use the premium weapons and it changes daily so if you don't want to spend your money you still have many weapons to use, its pretty fun."
Great game i like it way better than into the dead 2 but somtimes when it has the cutseen in the beggining it freeses and then crashes. And also almost every time after a run it just crashes. So its good game i do recomend but just know it crashes alot
"This game used to work so smoothly, now the new updated version has terrible frames per second for a mid range phone and the whole theme of the game feels less atmospheric"
"I really liked the game. And even the story line is good. There are limited ads. The graphics are good with reference to the size of the game. Fun to play when you are bored.😊😊😍 The reason why I gave it 4 star is because, most of the weapons and pets can only be obtained through real money. Other than that everything is good."
"I played this game on my old tablet in middle school; loved it. Could never get the Facebook reward thing no matter what I did, though. But you don't even have to buy the extra weapons because they appear as gravestone-like power ups so paying isn't necessary. Great game."
"I personally think that this game is very neat, great when you have no WiFi and you just want to do something that slaps the boredom out of you. I find it really fun to butcher zombies and live in the apocalypse. It's nothing really more than that."
"great way to kill time its challenging without being unfair, the boosters can be obtained by watching adds, any add interruption is minimal, lots and lots of good sales for good weapons."
"I love this game, but lately its been dropping frames and lagging. Please fix! It used to be my go to, and i miss it"
its very good game you run with diffrent guns u pick up out of these green crates with green flares u can also have an dog and the only reason a 4 is because u have to pay for most things instead of unlocking it free but evrything else is good would give a 5 if you could get more things for free like the sabre the tiger but u need to play for a year or something like that
A bit distracted on the movement. Need a smooth way on the left and right side. And the way on running cam be added with another mode/style. Overall 4 starts game
the game is very very addictive and good the graphics are also good and gameplay is also good but the reason I gave it 4 stars is the timing of our pet he comes very late and there are very less chances to get a machine gun in the crates please solve these essues
"Kind of wish there were floating buttons for the left and right so i won't get lost and end up firing instead of turning, but overall it's really good!!"
The controls could do with being a little more responsive but once i got more used to them I'm now really enjoying the game. I can recommend it and if it's new to you ( like it was to me ) give it a try.
"Play this on my chromecast with a bluetooth controller. It's way better than using the phone. Games fun, it is repetitive though. Definitely fun to play to burn a little time."
"Good game pretty fun and exciting. But its better if you can equip atlis 2 or 3 weapons, and the random boxes are just ammo. It annoyed me picking random weapons."
"Great zombie game with challenging, but not impossible missions. I used to play it a few years a go and was amazed when I found it again."
"The game is fun but there's no real ""end game"". Run, die, get money, buy guns, repeat. This was most likely a concept game of into the dead two. Which actually has a story and levels."
"Dear Devs: this game is awesome and sooo fun, but I wish the weapons didn't cost real money, or at least not all of them. Either way the game is still awesome. Pleeeease devs please add a doggo companion! Please! Even if it takes all my money I will buy it without a second thought! Doggos are awesome and I would thoroughly enjoy a doggo companion!"
"it is very hard to beat your high score. But other than that it is really good. The ""controls"" every is talking about is just asking what side of the screen do you want to move on."
"The graphics are good but could be better, one thing about this game that really touches my soft spot is the multiple advantages(perks,coins ...and so on) that comes with playing with internet connection, ON."
"Into the Dead is one of my personal favorite mobile games on the play store. However it's a four star, because while it's fun and a great time killer, it's also very repetitive. It's kinda just the same thing over and over. But it's still a fun game. Overall four star review"
"I like the game so far. I havent played a whole lot, but I'm getting the hang of it. Starting at 1500 is kinda rough, given i only have a few things unlocked, but I'm sure itll level out."
"Great game but some weapons are very weak, and the game feels repetitive. The perk and money system fell fair, but some perks are just worse than others. But overall it's a great game."
This game is amazing with all the details. I love how you can have your own dog with you or a new starting point I just downloaded it yesterday and I automatically fell in love with it! So far the best game I downloaded by far.
Very good game but when you get the pistol and there are zombies you can't shoot it and you die and same with the chainsaw. But other than that it is a very good game
Latest update has Fabolous graphics! But some glitches of course... Some guns such as machine gun just cover all the screen which we can't even see the zombies!
"Nice game to play. But every thing needs to be purchased. And cannot connect with Facebook because of some age, country or other criteria. Cannot understand what the criteria actually are."
"This game is cool and awesome but sometimes it crashes and the next thing when I launch the game again it says ""the package is unathorised with server please reinstall the package on Google Play Store"" I ended up deleting the application and downloading it with my other Google account and it worked"
"It's fun so far ! Has a lot of zombies , I think the levels should have more detail ( meaning slow it down an work on picture quality)."
"Quite decent game. Simple, with easily unlockable weapons, excellent for mind relaxation and killing time while waiting. Better than the sequel."
"I can frek'n hear my breathing, while im running, dodging those zombies while im thinking, when am I gonna get the next weapon and the dog, when I'm killed so is mans best friend, i am trying to use less of the dog, its the whining i cant handle, so glad this is only a game, this game has my full attention. AWESOME!!!"
"Excuse me, I can't even move or shoot in the game. Is this some sort of bug? I've exited the game and came back several times, but it still isn't working. Can you fix? I like the game otherwise though."
I'm a big fan of zombie games into the dead is fun to play and the weapons and companions are amazing!!! .
It's a very fun game. Just a little problems. Please add a reticle or crosshair when we hand a weapon for increase accuracy.
"This game is awesome, i like the graphics and the game play as well. I also like how terrifying the zombies are when they catch you."
Realistic thrilling game! The guns and modes are amazing. Maybe just need a little improvement with the companions so i can buy them without connect to internet
"It's a really good game but since it's considered in offline games so it should've have more offline assets like more weapons, dogs etc etc which you should be able to buy with in-game coins."
I do like the game it's just that I have a Facebook account and I want to get the world war 2 zombie skin but it keep coming up as a error will you please try and fix the issue.
"Amazing game I felt like I was running but I spotted some bugs Like while jumping , when running through the corn field that's why I only gave 4/5 . Overall it's a nice game to play and the makers please look into the bugs"
"Very fun ngl, bit too many ads though and the cost is quite high like for a gun it's about £14??? Srsly? 𝑮𝒐𝒐𝒅- Fun Exciting Good graphics Smooth gameplay 𝑩𝒂𝒅- Lots of ads Prices are slightly too high Repetitive"
"Had great fun dodging and killing the undead till I nearly sparked out some bloke who was stood next to me at the bus stop with my elbow, not the games fault, mine totally. Great game, love it to death. (sorry random bloke at the no 17 bus stop)."
"This is an outstanding game. However, i have one problem. I want to use my Google opinion rewards for a dog and even though I have ₹ 83 in my account it shows only ₹ 47 in the purchase window. Please fix this !"
Its a great game with great graphics. Plzz add hands while running without any weapons which will make it more realistic. ITS A REQUEST PLZZ ADD IT
This game is amazing it's really worth it to download ghraphics are great and I've been playing this for 3 years now this game is so fun!!! I rated this 4 because the controllees are so FREAKING N HARD TO CLICK!!! I know it's worth it but WHY IS THE CONTROLLER SO HARD CAN'T IEVEN FIND IT PLS UPDATE THIS APP!!! 😤
"I like this game very much , but i rate it 4 stars because i can't understand, in the part 2 we see that james is saving his family and taking them to the helicopter, but i heard a crash sound, then i rememeber that in the starting of game, i saw a helicopter, now my question is is the part 2 is the starting of part1"
Its good..but its a little boring to just run endlessy how about adding a story line or lore or more maps and areas and more guns then it would be cool.
Extremely Fun! hardly any ads and very challenging! I can't wait to try the second one!
Not very much content and the weapons cost money to upgrade but the flashlight mode I really liked. The Into the dead 2 game is what gives this a 4 star and not a 3 though.
best graphics zombie game I play ever but I am giving four stars because some weapons in this game is not good example : grenades are worst weapon' s and more so I would think you can fix some bugs in the weapons but really fantastic game
"❤❤Its the most....no,but one of the most amazing game,which I had played..;)...the game is so INTERESTING...The weapons can be improved...A CHILL GAME...The graphics are good.This game has its own good qualities as well as bad , & I am not interested to have those in here...and that's all,ending up my words...❤❤"
"The graphics the modes are great but its getting boring because there only thing i can do is to Run,Shoot and Survive (I forgot about competing with the other players) but its a great game anyway"
Would have loved to give 5 stars except I find that I dont seem to move left or right fast enough. Its like u are only allowed to go a certain distance too the left or the right resulting in me missing crates because I cannot get there in time.
the overall game is fun. but classic mode is the toughest to complete missions on unless it is a distance mission.
"its an awesome game by all means. the guns are great, the challenges are. Playing for last 6 months."
Really good game the reason im giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because while im doing classic mode i go through te zombies. So its kinda hard to die so please fix that Im keeping it at 4 stars until its fixed
"The game's a great classic with a lot of replayability. No two worlds are the same, so there's a lot of exploration to be done, which is fun. So many diverse biomes. One thing I'd love to see is an End (or Desert) revamp. Sountrack's beautiful, and makes the experience a lot more charming and unique (Pigstep go brr). As for interface and controls (for mobile) they could use some tweaking. They made GUI smaller (which makes the hotbar smaller) and there's no way to make it as big as it was."
"Great game. The new touch controls from today's update are a little same and placing blocks over a void seems like it's harder to do than before. Haven't tested on switch or keyboard yet. Overall updates have been great additions or improvements to game. Naming mobs like endermites needs polishing. Getting knocked back, waiting for the ""name"" button to appear adds challenge that isn't present on PC."
"I love the game, and I appreciate the updates, but not the updated controls. The controls are harder, and separating and placing blocks on the crafting table is unnecessarily harder to do than before. If you don't change them, could you at least let there be an older control option that you can turn on instead? Thank you! 4 stars for now."
"I enjoy the game a lot but unfortunately, in the last couple of days, I've been unable to sign into my Microsoft account and it's lead to me not being able to join realms or wear my skins. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game and it ultimately said ""error code: creeper."" After looking up the issue, it gave me possible issues but none of the possible issues seemed to be the right one."
"This app is fun and I like building and creating houses. Recording videos. And playing on survival. The only problem is that the app would start lagging and would manually make me have to update it. Then I had to reinstall it multiple times because whenever I'd press ""your worlds"" It would freeze my game and kick me out. I need help fixing this issue. Thank you."
Minecraft is a timeless classic. I enjoy building exploring worlds! Wish the game would move from giving higher end smart phones just 8 chunk simulation distance though. It's annoying knowing I can't build bigger bases without cramming everything together like my crop farms and trees I grow compared to PC/Console do to this. The new touch controls are much better but the Pocket ui needs to be redesigned as well to work better with it in the crafting menus.
Pretty good! I love minecraft and enjoy playing it a lot. One main issue though as of right now My friends cant seem to join my world? It just doesnt work for them and I dont know if this is just my device or something but I've gone through all of my setting and it still hasn't fixed :[ But that's basically the only bad thing about this :] It's been great otherwise! I've seen some people talk about the new controls on here- yall can just go to settings and set it back to your preferred :P
"I love the concept of Minecraft 100%. Everything is super fun to play, the graphics are always smooth, the game play is flawless and fair, and overall, the game runs extremely well. Unfortunately, the only thing I have to complain about is the multiplayer. For some reason, when me and my friend go to get on the same world, it only loads one of us on, and kicks the other one off. Everything is up to date, wifi runs fine, and we can't find out why this happens. Maybe a bug?"
"I was able to install it! But to be honest, the buttons aren't that responsive like the way they use to in 2019 (last time I played minecraft on mobile ) also you have to have a lot of space for the worlds but other than that, graphics are good, cross-play is still fun, you can use a xbox (or playstation) controller using bluetooth for this game! To be honest, $8 for this was worth it!"
"Great game. I have put in dozens of hours in playing with family. Some of the controls are a bit wonky and hard to get used to. Selecting specific amounts from a stack of items is random at best, jump attacks are near impossible to pull off, and controls are not customizable to any degree of personal preference. These issues are possible to become accustomed to, but the ability to customize your interaction button layout would make the game much better."
"Great game, played it since I was 9 on PS3 and then eventually PS4. Finally got it on my phone and now it has a repeating glitch where it won't let me into marketplace and skins won't load. It doesn't even let me use my purchased worlds, which is also frustrating. It happened before and then got resolved, but it's back again and it's frustrating."
"This is a great game but I have run into one flaw. It is that I had a world that I've been working on and when I saved it to go do something else and came back the world had reset. I don't know if it didn't fully save but I had 64 levels and it moved down to 30, I lost all my items and progress but it saved buildings. Please fix this, it could have just been a Glitch but this has happened before."
"I've been playing the game for a while now and it's fine. The controls are a bit janki almost. Whenever I try to move sometimes it reads that I'm placing and or mining and will do those actions. Also recently I can't seem to install any shaders, it's worked before. I think it may be the version of the packs but some of them are for the newest version so please help if you think you know what might be wrong. Overall I really like the game."
I'm going to put this in the best way possible. It doesn't let me play with friends. Updates are too big for mobile players. Custom skins are too expensive. If munecraft was free I would be okay but it isn't then they charge you 20 dollars for a skin. But I like spending money so that's a plus and I like being steve so that's a plus. And sometimes you. Need some alone time in minecraft that's a plus. Finally when it crashes its telling me I need a break that's a plus. Overall score 4/5.
It's still a very great and nostalgic game to play. love every detail of it. the only issue I'm having is with realms. I can never seem to get it to connect to the realms servers and it will not allow me to create or use a realms account. hoping it's temporary but if not I'm hoping it gets looked into. until then it's 4/5 simply for the realms and connectivity issues
"My skin refuses to load in no matter what I do and it gets a bit laggy at times if you raise the chunk rendering distance from 4 to 6 or 8. It'd also be nice if you could reposition the on screen buttons from the settings, the D-pad on my screen is nearly clipping, it's caused some bad luck in game for sure. Otherwise a great game."
"This game is genuinely one of the best I've played. The new control scheme, well, exists. And you can switch between the old and the new at anytime in the settings. There's a glitch with the new one tho. Whenever I place (or destroy) a block with the NEW split controls, it can sometimes register a hold instead. Now this isn't really a problem in survival like, at all. But in creative it can get pretty annoying. Misplaced a block? Now you misplaced multiple. Please fix this. I'd type more but yea"
"The graphics, textures and aesthetics are absolutely gorgeous, of course, for a pixel sandbox game, which makes this game really great and it's such creative for a lot of people to do whatever they want. Even this mobile version it is still good, but the only thing that I don't like about is the gameplay, which makes it somewhat difficult to turn around to kill hostile mobs at night or watching out for lava while mining, building expert house, etc. But it is still a great experience by the way."
"Honestly this game us an artists dream, you can build basically everything. You can use add-ons easily, and you can customize your skin easily. I dislike the new update tho, I liked how I was able to take all items out of a furnace at a time but now I have to spam click to take all the items out. This is very annoying when making items in a crafting table, the amount of times I've accidentally made too many items because I clicked to fast is infuriating. All that time mining absolutely gone!!!"
"I love minecraft and how far it's come. I remember building towers as a kid and now I find survival to be more for me. Exploring, discovering, you name it. one thing that bothers me is the fact that, at least for me, the controls are really really bad.. I'd much prefer a joystick option or at least the ability to customize where each button is located. I can just imagine people worh bigger hands playing this game.. it's already uncomfortable for me, I'd hate to hear worse."
"Great experience overall, takes some time to get used to the controles (inventory and crafting) when you came from java. The only problem I have and the main reason that I bought the game for was offline play when bored without an internet connection, the thing is it keeps crashing everytime. I hope you can fix this, cause when I play with an internet connection it doesn't crash at all so I hope it'll be an easy fix. Thanks in advanced."
"An amazing game. I love the features, gaming style, and the ability of being able to freely explore the game with so many limitless possibilities. Until recently, I've had no issues with the game. As someone who plays consistently on multiplayer with my friends, I care about having my own skin for identification. That being said, a glitch has recently occurred, where the skins often get mixed up. Please fix this, Microsoft."
"It's the Minecraft I wanted, runs great on my phone, and for the price it's a no-brainer for a solid mobile game. The only, and I mean only issues I have are: understandably the game force-pauses for an incoming call. However this causes the game to become unresponsive when returned to the pause menu. This causes a loss of any unsaved progress, and I tend to play Creative so that tends to be a whole lot of lost progress. I've restarted worlds six times so far. I hope an update addresses this."
"Once you get the game running and close it, it is impossible to get to run again. Sometimes force stopping works but other times it doesn't. But other than that it's a great port of the original minecraft. Works best with a controller though. Edit: After a few updates it's gotten a lot better. No more force closing, but the best way to play is still with a controller. I hope you guys can add settings to move the on screen controls."
"For a mobile version this is an excellent game. having fun with friends regardless of the platform is great, and controller support is a plus. The problem is the monotization. I play Java Edition on PC, and if i can get a better version of the same texture, skin or whatnot for FREE on Java, why would i pay for it here (or on any of the other platforms that Bedrock Edition is supported)? I hate the monetization, but it is what it is."
Being an avid minecraft player in the Java days (still is) it's cool to see this work as well as it does on the phone. However I need to point out one critical error. You can't join any of the featured servers. You sign in to your microsoft account and then you try to get on to one of them and it says unable to join world. This happens for all of them. That needs fixing. It use to work before and now it don't seem to anymore. Not even reinstall fix it.
"Perfect for fueling your imagination. You can play survival and explore an infinite world or try creative to transform the world. Amazing... except for one thing. If you pause the game, it doesn't actually pause the game. It just brings up the pause menu. Who does that? I just paused my game and turned off my phone, next thing I know I'm dead and my stuff has despawned. If the developers learned the definition of 'pause' I would rate 5 stars."
"Pocket edition is great for those trying to play but don't have the gaming consoles. For me overall the game quality is good, but there are major late sometimes and multiplayer should be worked on. I think multiplayer could be alot easier if I didn't always get ""can't connect to world"" various times, with no explanation or solution on how to fix it."
"Ever since the latest update, Minecraft has barely been able to run on my Android. So far, any and all of my worlds which have blocks that came from add-ons are missing, so most maps are severely distorted. I also haven't been able to play with any other people since the update. When I try joining other realms, it'll get stuck on ""Generating terrain,"" then it'll just shut off. I've cleared about 3 or 4 gigabytes of storage just in case, with no results. Otherwise, quite an excellent game."
"It's minecraft alright, but there are some not-so-nice issues. Whenever I try to connect with my Mojang/Microsoft account, it crashes. So no online play. You also basically require to have a mouse/keyboard or else you're extremely limited on how fast you can do anything. Nothing that I have a solution to, so it's not effecting my star rating. I feel like this is a worse experience from when I first played pocket edition almost a decade ago, back when zombies weren't even in the game."
"overall it's a pretty fun game, but one thing I've just been hating lately is the camera stutter. whenever I move my finger across the screen, most times it goes smoothly, but sometimes it just constantly stutters. it would go away but then it would come back and stay for a while. it's so annoying while I'm building because of the constant stutter while looking around for places to put blocks. please fix this so I can give it 5 stars. I dont have an old phone, I have the Samsung galaxy s9."
"Loving the update but small problem. The game keeps force closing me after a bit. Its really bothersome because each time I have to relaunch the game. And after I do get back on everything i did for about three seconds before the crash is undone. I'm pretty sure it's the app not my phone since I'm using a galaxy S10+. Please fix this, I love the game and dont want to lose the ability to play."
"After an update, the game finally runs well on my OnePlus 7T. Minecraft is a great game that anybody can enjoy, and the mobile version is just as featured as the console versions. A controller can be connected for the best experience, and players can customize their experience with behavior packs and skins. The crossplay is one of the best features (One can play with friends on console). There is a bug that sometimes prevents me from playing the game, which is pretty much my only gripe."
"Overall this game has transferred great onto mobile, however there are a few issues with performance that occur even in high-end devices. For example, repetitive crashing, blank music discs, and my worlds will not copy. though in the end this game still provides an immersive and seamless experience. Thank you for the hard work you've put into perfecting this game."
"So on the fold 3 device this game is stunning, fast load times, beautiful graphics, and can handle mods and textures quite easily. But this doesn't mean it doesn't have a bunch of issues, for one, there is absolutely NO FIX for when whenever I play with a wired or wireless keyboard the space bar will stop working and I have to change the keybind in order to jump. It's really frustrating, I'd add more but I'm at the character limit."
"This game is absolutly amazing! I love it a lot, the only downside is that in some of the servers you arent allowed to have a party with more than one person. All my friends play minecraft so this is really upsetting. Another problem is that the game crashes randomly at times and every time you go onto the game it changes your skin to a defalt skin and you have to change it back to your own skin. Lastly i wish you were able to exit a world without saving. That sucks when people blow up stuff"
Excellent app!! I enjoy playing it a lot! But once I was building and it said I was out of storage so I shut it off to fix later but when I came back on it had deleted all my work on that world. It can also take over 15 minutes to load. Sometimes glitchy but very good. When I started playing I learned what I was missing out on. Also when played on Xbox remote the buttons make hardly any sense. You should really enjoy this game.
"Well, I love this game. A problem is that when battling someone or walking/running in general, the screen goes wacko. I mean, you suddenly face the opposite direction. in a lot of cases this gets me KILLED. Please, update the sensitivity settings as I've tried all. Thanks, Mojang! ADDED, When the app signs into Xbox Live as you first open it, the app closes! multiple times! It won't let me in the app."
"I love minecraft, but recently I've been having a problem logging in on bedrock. Whenever I close and re-open minecraft, it doesnt let me play with friends or save any progress. The problem can be reset with a simple reinstalling.. but it's still annoying to have to go through every time I close the app. I couldn't find anything on it in the help center either. Please get to the problem when you can."
"Great overall experience with this version. It's a fully featured Minecraft (Bedrock Edition) on the go. The only issue is after the recent update it crashes on the main menu after a few seconds on my Galaxy Note9. Before this started, however, game ran flawlessly and was exactly the same experience as playing in any other platforn (which, was the goal of them unifying versions). But please...fix this crashing."
"Since the moment it was released, a classic. The mobile version is still wonderful, but it does have a few things that could be fixed. We don't get updates as quick as users of PCs and sometimes even consoles, also it's much harder to get things like mods, as you have to download separate apps for that. Overall, the app is always wonderful."
"This may be one of the greatest games ever made, besides Minecraft Java. Its easy to pick up and challenging. After you beat the game, there is more game. Unfortunately, there's no official way to go back to older versions. The controls make it so you can't select while jumping. Maybe there could be a way to map controls to phone buttons. Also, you need a Microsoft account to play online. Not the case before. Four stars due to this. But well worth the $7.99. Would recommend."
"Great game! However, I have a few complaints. Firstly, Java edition has several more features, such as improved combat, off-hands, and Hardcore mode. I would improve my rating to 5 stars if these features were added in. Secondly, the game lags a little bit if the world size is too large. It makes it difficult to enjoy the game to the fullest when a monster or animal takes damage a full second after I hit it, or a block breaks several seconds after it should. Gladly 5 if these are fixed."
"Love it and I've been playing on Xbox for about 2 years and I heard there was the app on Google play so I downloaded it and the touch screen is confusing but you can fix it by Bluetoothing an xbox controller and it should be good. I'm just a little disappointed that you can't transfer console worlds to the app. But this game has survival mode where you can gather resources, build a shelter and fight monsters, creative mode where you can fly everywhere and literally do whatever u want, it's fun."
"It's a great game, but it keeps having this problem where it takes forever to load (it shows a solid grey screen for like ten minutes). I deleted and redownloaded once and now it's having the problem again. I really don't want to delete it again, but I probably will. It's nice that there are no ads and you do not need to pay to play (just the purchasing of the game, which is a fair price). Any in-app purchases are entirely optional."
"Minecraft is doing great for mobile so far, but theres a few issues with the framerate, sometimes slowing down a bunch just from wandering around near forests or oceans. On a LG 7 thin this is pretty surprising. And with crafting large amounts of one item, placing a bunch of blocks quickly, and sprinting, it also slows the game down. And with controllers, the game will sometimes make the player spin or walk in one direction for a while before stopping. Hopefully these issues will get fixed in the next update. Keep up the good work Mojang."
"Amazing, best game I've ever played, would rate it ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ if the microsoft accounts didn't unlinked and disconnect every 10 minutes. This gets very annoying, and one time earnable achievements go to waste and don't save, everything freezes, and nothing's working. It also says it's not connected to internet so I can't use the store or look at achievements. And it only works with certain internet, refusing to use certain kinds... Please fix this issue, the last ""fix"" for this only made it worse"
"I enjoy playing this game with my friends. It is a very wonderful game that I would recommend. I have been playing it over the years and am still having a wonderful experience. But, when I went to activate a texture pack I bought, the app suddenly closed itself out. I tried to reopen it, everything seemed normal, but then the app closed itself again after it finished loading. I tried restarting my tablet and powering it back on, but resulted in the same outcome. Please fix this issue! From Bob"
"This is by far my favorite game, along with Roblox. I don't have many issues with it, aside from crashing from time to time, but that's always because of my device. My tablet crashes every game I play. Other than that, my only issue is that every so often, I have to click in a completely different place to actually get something to open. For instance; to open my inventory, I have to click really far down on my screen to get it to open, thought I usually just have to click close to the bottom."
"A few bugs in this game: the parent consent thingy doesn't work at all, so I can't play multiplayer or realms. It randomly signs you out every time I open it. I can only do one thing in a furnace each time I click into it. I hope you find a fix for these soon. Thank you and keep up the good work Mojang! Update: Also, in the new update, I can't spam in the crafting menu when I want to craft a lot of a certain item. All I can do is click a lot of times with 0.5-second gaps. Still a great game!"
"Hi, this is a great game with infinite possibilities, and really helps me get creative, but since the new update, I have encountered a problem where on creative it takes as long as survival to break blocks which is weird, I don't know if it's a new feature or a glitch but it's very annoying so please fix it thank you very much!"
"I mean I love this game and all but the marketplace won't respond half the time and I can't play on realms it always says that the problem is in the accout although I've fixed it like Infinite times! Please fix this, then there's this annoying music that plays every time I open the game and, it would be nice if there was an option that makes you insert the kind of music you ACTUALLY wanna hear."
"Love this game, it's been a favorite for years, but lately I haven't been able to play because my buttons just vanished?!? They disappeared shortly after the last update (not the one that just came out, but the previous one) and I'm so sad! I've tried going through every setting I can think of and I can't get them back. Not even able to access my inventory without using a crafting table or something. Idk what's going on :("
"This game is AMAZING,I love playing this with my brother and building and surviving but I have a few suggestions 1. Add hardcore to bedrock. 2. Let us be able to put banners on Shields on bedrock. 3. Add more fruits. There's a few glitches like when I play it suddenly turns into a black screen or just frozen and when I get out of a boat it sometimes just disappeared and sometimes some of my worlds got deleted and I swear I had wifi and signal but overall great game!😗"
It's a really good game. I've been playing Minecraft for over 5 years now and still love it. Tho I have to give 4 stars since somehow all my worlds did disappear. I just left the beta Programm and had to reinstall the game. This is when I discovered the article that explained that you might use your worlds on android during a reinstall. Bro thanks I just figured. That's so frustrating since I lost a world with over 100 hours of playtime and I'm left with none. I just wish I had seen it earlier.
"I love the game and why I didnt give it 5 stars is because of 2 reasons. 1 Everytime I open a chest, an item wants to split in half. 2 When I play with my brother, my game crashes and kicks me out of minecraft, so I have to log in again which is annoying. The bugs also get annoying as well like, when I am swimming in a ravine, I see slimes through the water and both glas pains and glass blocks. Good Job mojang for the game and hopefully the sniffer can find us flowers for my mom when she plays."
"Really good game. However I recently created a custom classic skin on an app, and the game told me it wasn't a Minecraft skin. I have tried everything from multiple different apps and deleting and reinstalling the game, and waiting weeks for the next update, but still nothing. I would really appreciate if this was fixed."
"I really like the ability to choose how many items in a stack you want, but I noticed recently that when you drag the stack over already occupied areas (even if they are the same block that isn't at a max stack) it doesn't work. It used to be able to add onto the stacks in the crafting table."
"Okay I believe this is an AMAZING APP- It's free2play and you are able to do alot without buying ingame purchases, one small note, though. Theres ALOT of excessive updates often and it happens so much I cannot really expect it, whenever I divide to play with a friend it just randomly says ""Outdated Client!"" All of the time, I understand this game is high maintenance and is worked on alot, but I feel as though all of the updates are making it harder for me to play since I cannot auto update."
"Really good in general, but I since the recent update I can only delete blocks if I hold twice as long instead of the usual time, which is really annoying. At first I thought it had completely stopped working, but I really hope this can get fixed soon."
"Item despawn time sometimes bugs out, despawning items much more quickly than normal. (lost good loot trying to recover in alotted time after death, was in time back at death site, but no items) Also when inside inventory, sometimes the cursor snaps from the right window (paperdoll/lootbox) to the left window (player inventory/crafting) without any input given. Using Gamesir X2 bluetooth controller on my S21 FE. Controller has no issues when moving or being used in any other game. Otherwise GG."
"game been great for such a long time, always working normally, until lately i haven't been able to use my xbox one controller to play, the app refuses to detect my (two joysticks, d-pad) some of the other buttons work though. I'd like this to be looked into please and hope for a good answer"
It is a really cool game. It is even one of my favorite games and i really love to build but when i add the windows there are lines on it that makes it look a little messy. I hate it that you can only do clear windows on a laptop or computer. I searched everywhere for how to get a clear window but when i look at the videos they all say i need to download this i need to download that. Can you please set a clear window settings on our phones to
"The game is well and all but there are still some few things needed to be fixed 1) there should be a a button on the screen to change the POV from first person, and third person. 2) we should be able to hold anything on our left hand or the off hand like java edition. 3) item splitting button on the screen so can drop item one by one. 4) enchantments list show in inventory only because it covers a huge part of screen for some seconds. 5) redstone mechanism should be same like java edition. Thank"
"Download failed... I've purchased several packs, have a couple realm subscriptions and can't download ANY packs. Every attempt just says Download Failed. I figured it out. My version is 1.16 and I am not getting the update option. Well, since I didn't receive any feedback or help, it took me a while to figure it out. For some reason I have to type minecraft in the search bar to be able to update it. Now that it is up to date, everything is fine. I'm enjoying the game now, and have lots to learn."
"Haven't played mc for almost 10 years but it's still golden. My brother and I never gets bored. We always build and try something new. On the other hand, whenever I uninstall it, i'll unfortunately lose my world and despite I try to find it in the given files, nothing occurs. Pls fix this just so I don't waste my efforts into the world's that I've created."
"This game is phenomenal, just one small problem. I try to import a custom skin into the game, but it keeps giving me the message,""That's not a minecraft skin silly,"" even though it's the right type of file and image. Please fix this problem Mojang."
"Minecraft is a great game! I like all the new features, except the new controls. The new controls are unnecessarily harder and complicated. Please add an option to revert back to the old controls, as I have been playing Minecraft on mobile since the last 7 years, and I've gotten used to them so much that I can't even play Minecraft normally with these controls! Although, everything else taken in factor, Minecraft is still a great and classic game!"
"I have an issue with the 1.19.63 update. I can't craft a stack by double tapping quickly. In other words, if I want to craft a stack of gold blocks, I have to tap the screen 64 times instead of the previous double tap that would auto craft whats ever left in the crafting table. Pls reach out if you have a solution."
"This game is pretty good. I've been playing for years. Right now, the most recent update won't let me play. It just freezes. I thought it was space. But that wasn't the case. The wifi wasn't the problem either. As soon as I updated, I stopped being able to play. Please fix."
"Awesome game. I downloaded it for my son now I'm into it lol. I love how we can build and visit different villages and I like how we can scavenge for supplies in survival. One thing, though. Is it possible to let the villagers keep building while you're with them? I noticed they disappear when you're in their village too long? Also, add markets to the game? It's a wonderful learning tool as well between me and my kids. TIA!"
It is fun! But I don't like how it says outdated servers when you accidentally hit a button sometimes and it's hard to get it to go back. And I forget how to do it. But it is a fun and exciting game. I would rate it a five but the outdated servers I do not like (Minecraft if you can fix that please do)
"The game is ok with it's yearly updates and It very fun to play with friends, explore, and build big things. One thing I would like them to fix is the commands list, it's complicated to use now. Fill and execute commands don't work anymore. I hope they fix that."
"Minecraft is always awesome. But still there are some lag issues. Even when I have an Excellent processing android which supports Gaming hassle-free, it still lags. I do think Minecraft should think about some updates to fix lagging issues more than other updates."
"I really like the game but, there are some problems alot of time it doesn't let me join my friends also on bedrock this is usually fixed by making sure we are both updated to the latest version but it does not work sometimes. Overall it is worth the $7.99"
"When there's an update, I have to delete and download the game again and most times it just won't download, even if I've closed the tab, restarted my phone and switched to a different account back to the one i bought it on. It just won't download. Overall the actual game is nice, it's cool that on mobile you can pick your controls to whatever is more comfortable for you. The carnival/fair game is my favorite and it's free. My mom likes it too so that's cool too."
"The new update with the controls has made it unaccessible for me to create and join worlds. This is because the pop up for explaining what to do takes up my whole screen and there is no way to proceed, the only way to exit this pop up it to press the back arrow in the top left corner and that only brings me back to what I had been trying to do. Even when going into settings there is no way for me to prevent this, and it causes me to not be able to play Minecraft at all."
"Update 1.19.71 made the game lose my world. Maybe it only affects Android, I'm not sure. I found my world again so try this if you have the same problem. From the title screen, tap ""Settings"". On the left side of the screen scroll down and tap ""Storage"". Under ""File storage location"" tap the box below that said ""External"" for me. Then tap ""Application"" to use the app's internal storage. Go back and try to play the world. This game's great if it doesn't lose worlds."
"My only complaint is when you open and close settings, or change the game perspective it lags the game for 4-5 seconds. Besides that minor inconvenience, Its great! definetley worth the money."
"This is a very interesting video game. The aspects of it, the building, the redstone machines, the hunting, the pretty much everything are really good in a way that's sort of adventurous."
"- the game is great - the mobile control sucks - there's the... marketplace? - when you died, all items are dropped and will despawn for 5 minutes. I fell in the nether and I can't go back because my bucket of powdered snow is down there a small island in the middle of the ocean of lava. If ou want to turn on keep inventory, you need to enable cheat and it will disable achievement. I guess that's how it is. - creative mode is great. - I still like minecraft"
"The game is good, very good, but the only thing I don't like, is that when I use /fill command, it says ""can't place blocks out of the world"", and the command don't work. Me and my brother likes to make build battles, but when I am placing the bedrock wall, that is technically 100 blocks long and tall, the /fill doesn't work"
Minecraft has to be my favourite cross-platform fame that you can play on different devices . One problem I've been having recently is the marketplace packs/world's not downloading. It's been really annoying since I can't access any thing from the marketplace . Wether I use WiFi or mobile data it still doesn't work and I cant see a solution to fix it . I tried clearing marketplace cache but it still didn't work . And that's why I probably gave this a rate of 4 stars .
"I purchased the skyblock pack but, I don't know how to access it. Update*** I finally found it but, it would have been nice to have a way to select or filter to purchased/owned items, skins, worlds/maps, etc. I'm leaving the 3* review because of how difficult it was to find the appropriate skyblock that I had purchased so I could download it and have it available within a reasonable amount of ease that does not currently exist. *Updated to 4*"
"A truly amazing game, minus some little bugs like how it kicks me out of the whole app when I try to get something from my inventory. I hope that gets fixed in the next update soon,other then that its fairly good game very fun and let's you be creative with what you build."
I love this game but lately my friends has been removed from my friend list. But when I search for their name we are friends and I want that to be fixed. I wanna play with my friends sometimes too. Now I can't anymore. And I also keep disconnecting when I can join.
"First of all this game is awesome I love playing on survival with friends and on the servers! but when I switch emails the game had a bug that u can't fix forcing me to delete it :( but don't worry it's free cuz I already bought it, NOPE since I switched emails I had to buy it AGAIN and on top of that it won't let me sign back in so annoying 😠 now I can't play with friends and that's the reason I haven't been on it in awhile but it's still a great. ( also the crafting table is lagging)"
This is a really cool game I have been playing for a few years now on different accounts the only problem I have had recently is the game saying I need to buy it through okay store even though I did this is only when I am offline and not all the time it just means I can't always play it gets annoying but in the end it's really fun and you can do almost anything with your worlds
"This game is amazing, and I love it so much. The main issue I have with this game is the fact that Java Edition has so much more features compared to Bedrock. Features like being able to stop vines, glow berries, etc, from growing with shears, Hardcore mode, same entity AI as Java, etc. Would make Bedrock easily 5 stars."
it's amazing! the only reason why I dint put a five star review is first when u pop up in the main menu u are really laggy and when u use the ipad part u are laggy a bit as well but when I use the computer I'm totally fine? I still would like Mojang to fix the ipad part and the menu part but other then that it's really fun! I can play with my friends and I can go online and also offline playing to! I'm really happy with this. of course there is bugs to be fix but I'm glad I payed and played ^^
"This would be a five star review if there was the option to play different versions of Minecraft like you can in the pc version using the Minecraft launcher. Otherwise this is a brilliant game and I highly recommend that you buy it, especially if you don't have a pc or a console. This is a great alternative and is available on most phones."
"The game is as good as it gets. From the first launch till today, the game has somewhat evolved. However, what lacks today are meaningful community-developer interactions and engaging multiplayer base. The mobile version is always gonna be a different experience from the computer version, and the player base has always been on the younger end. However, if the game is to persist, Mojang as developer needs to tone down their approach on so-called new updates and communicates the game meaningfully"
"The game was great until the latest update. My brother had just done the update on his tablet and for some unknown reason, had deleted all of his worlds, but I still had all mine. My mom/dad thought it was a glitch or something until they asked me. I was really disappointed with Minecraft when this happened. Can you please fix this? Also I really wish you change the control buttons back. The new drawstick takes up more than half of the left of my screen. Everything else was fine 👍"
"The new control methods are pretty good, my only complaint is that it is virtually impossible to swim. Pressing the sprinat button in the water dose nothing. Other than that I absolutely love this game."
"Minecraft is great and all but weird random glitches keep happening like I tried to import one of my skins, but it just brought up my old imported skin and when I tried to join one of my worlds it but said ""failed to load world"" I tried all my other ones and it said the same thing for all of them so l logged out of my account and it said there was an error that has happened to me another time so now it's 2 times it's happened so please help me fix it Minecraft."
"I really only have one suggestion? Rather than pc players being able to simply download a mod to smooth out glass, I think it'd be nice if it could just be a feature in minecraft itself? Or even have separate blocks and panes that don't have checker lines all over what's supposed to be a window? That's my only problem that REALLY annoys me. Not sure about anyone else. Other than that, I've always loved minecraft since I started playing way before bedrock version existed."
"I gave it a 4, but sometimes when I tryto update it, it just stops at like 50%-60% and when it DOES get to 100 it doesn't even update and sometimes after the first update, it makes me update, AGAIN. Although besides that, this game is pretty entertaining, and you can make friends, add friends, and build. Pretty nice game mojang. Keep it up! hi im glad ur here"
"This game was amazing at first I got to have a lot of fun playing multiplayer but what I don't like is that the Minecraft updates do not update on certain phones meaning I cannot play with any of my friends if they have a lower phone or a higher phone than me and also the new control buttons are really hard for me to use.this game was fun as it was,there was no need for it to be changed if things went back to normal than that would be good"
Controls could be better but other than that this is nearly identical to the console experience and great for when I need to game on the go . (I play in creative and have realms but I've never used survival on here)
"So just a minor issue but why cannot i import a skin texture? It's a 64x64 .png file. I keep getting ""that's not a skin silly"" message. I don't really understand because before the latest update I was able to. Currently using a Google pixel 6 pro with Android 13. Can't seem to find a to make it work. Would love some feedback."
"I like the game so far, but, as an official veteran of this game, I say that you changed it too much... I remember this game from a long time ago, and I think you went overboard when changing it. Everything slows you down, you have to get coins, check the passport, camt be free when entering an area, and the controls are annoying. Please the the old game back!"
"Overall very fun if you're into this type of game, one thing that could make this better is going with a more gta type style not in a bad way but like the ability to walk around the city and airport. I also think that they need to either make more maps or add locations because it can get boring just driving back and forth from the city to the airport and the outdoor area that I don't remember the name to."
"The game is great, and I'm surprised it's possible to be played on mobile considering how detailed it is, but I have one issue. The micro-transactions. I get it. It's a thing of modern games, and why I mostly play games from 2005 area. But 20 USD for a single car skin is insane. Make it cost in-game currency. Not real-life money. People say GTA V is a cash-cow, but at least money is easy to get, and nothing costs real money. Real money is optional. But not in this. Nope."
Really fun to play and if you turn off your internet you can play it without ads just fine! Runs pretty well on my phone and my main problem with it is there is a limit to how much you can destroy your car and that limit is definitely noticeable. I have never been to a point where my car couldn't drive anymore and yes that is probably to avoid frustration if would be nice if there was an option for it.
"It's a really good game and provides plenty of entertainment. I love it and I keep coming back to it. The ads are quite excessive in amount, though, and I really wish the interior for the interior camera was different for each car to give variety to this game. Also, the truck available on the game is quite pointless, and not being able to paint it is just stupid. At least make it paintable or just remove it from the game and add another, paintable, different-model truck or maybe even a few trucks. Also, on the Radar trials, it should not be scored in miles per hour. 240000 miles does not make sense. They should be scored in points which match the amount of miles per hour reached. These are just the many improvements this game can have. It's still good, but I wish it was better."
"The game itself is extremely good considering the digital storage it takes up. However, I find that many people hack it in the in-game competitions, and I hate that in the 2WD vehicles, it won't put the power down when it is only available to one wheel, making Trial extremely difficult. Also the LaFerrari in the game has some issues, like how it slows down and spins out randomly. The game will crash of you're playing for too long. There should be a button functioning like the ""restart"" button in Trial that doesn't spawn you to the last checkpoint, along with the button already there. A good game, not without its flaws."
"It's actually so jarring how much this game has changed since I played it way back in like 2015. It went from basically a tech demo with a few things to do and some cars to unlock to a full-on driving sim with missions, collectibles, daily rewards, microtransactions, and more. I must say I'm very impressed with how far the developers have come since then."
"I remember playing this back when I was 7. I suddenly found this app and downloaded it for nostalgia. One thing I noticed is that the car that WAS a Mustang, looks pretty ugly. I also recommend adding more cars, like a school bus, some more pickup trucks (such as a Chevy Silverado). Maybe even a Tesla will do. I also recommend adding more songs instead of having just one through out the entire gameplay. Other than that, it's a good game and I recommend getting."
"An absolutely fun game!! If you like cars and free roam games, this is the game for you! There should be a GPS feature, though. And there are a few things I would consider to be problems though: 1) Not compatible with computers. 2) The other cars in traffic mode always run straight into you if stand still on the road, but they'll wait for each other. 3) To. Many. Ads. Either way, this is a free roam mobile app game."
Pretty good game. But the only problem I really have with it is the ads. They are constant and disruptive. I also don't know why you have to get your passport checked by just going into a different area of the map. The passport check is a little annoying. I also think it's kind of odd that their is a empty space where a human should be driving. Can you add a update where you can costomize a human that is the driver of the car? If you fix these I will change review. But overall it's a good game.
"Incredible game. I'm a teenager and I've been playing this since I was probably ten. I prefer the old version but the new one is awesome too. The single reason I have four stars is because of a visual glitch. When you turn traction control off, and turn left after getting up to speed, the camera lets it turn and looks more like an action cam. When you turn right it stays on the bumper then gets weird. Super fun game. One of my favorites. Just please fix this super annoying visual bug."
"I really like this game. The controls and graphics are very smooth for a driving game on a mobile device. I don't really mind when you have to watch an ad to paint your car, but I would recommend an update for less frequent ads. I totally understand if you can't get this update, because like every mobile game has ads (I'm not braging). I don't really like how you go crazy fast and you get frequent dents on your car, but I love that you can fix your car with a push of a button."
"This is the perfect app for if you're 11-16 years old or if you want to get a early start (at 8-10 years old). The controls are hard to use because when you try to make it a slow speed it goes faster than I you expect it to be. Besides that, you could only give possotive comments. They also make great graphics and a great gameplay."
"This is a really fun game that I've been playing since 2015 or 2016, and the graphics are so much nicer compared to then the physics are decent, but the ads are a huge downside. They appear mid-driving, and it seems that doing anything gives you an add (you get an ad most menus you enter.) I get that you need ads to keep it free, they're just extremely annoying."
"Its insane that this is the same game i played many years ago, and it still is very fun. I do have a few suggestions though. Add a gps, add more biomes, make names for the cars, make an easier way to get money, and lessen the ad amounts. The ad amounts are a little frustrating but their not enough for me to throw my phone at the wall, and it is just WAY too difficult to make money, like, there are some of the cars that cost WAY too much for how difficult it is to make enough money. Fun game tho"
"It is very fun. A good way to get miles is to drive laps around the airport. Needs online multiplayer though. Also, why are all of the first person views the same. Like why does an old Camaro have the same interior as a Tesla cyber truck. I also don't see the point of the checkpoint mode. Kinda useless. And the fact that you need to earn it, yuck. Also the ads, 🤢🤮. Other than that, awesome game."
"I played this games years ago and it is different now, like different. There's a day and night cycle now and u have lights u can turn on and off and other things. I see that they HAVE been working on the game still and it's still fun to drive around and destroy your car. So if your looking for a decent car simulator to just destroy and drive your car in, try this one. Another thing I like is that there's different challenges and modes you can do."
"Amazing game. However I hate it when you hold the acceleration button for a little while than it slows you down and thinks you are not pushing the button. You have to press it again then it works but then it repeats. Also add more cars and make them at least 500$ cheaper. Also add more maps because it gets boring when you keep driving in the same map. And lastly please stop with ads every minute, really ads keep poping up and its very annoying.This is a good game and I'm pointing out its flaws."
"Great Game. The graphics are okay, but it runs perfectly on my device. but, I get bored after a while of playing. I own most of the cars ingame, but you can't race, most of the cars sound the same, and the events require a ""test car"". sure, it would be funny to try to scale buildings with a reventón, but could we use other cars in courses, destruction, and speed cameras? just imagine how the agera and veyron would compare in the speed cameras. with these, the game would be perfect! pls consider!"
"Great destruction physics, but the map is super unrealistic (like the airport) which has unrealistic structures and planes are badly designed. The AI traffic is pretty bad because they dont stop! Another thing is the interior. I know this is a 2014 game, but change the interiors. It is hard driving a Buggati with a Lamborghini interior. But this game is so addicting and you get a Lamborghini to start off and is really fun. (Sidenote: Disable ads by turning wifi and mobile data off)."
"Wow this new update is amazing. Better graphics, awesome animations, and a new feature to customize your car even further! The reason that I made this a 4 star review is because of the strip ads at the bottom. It absolutely annoys me to have part of my screen being covered by an ad constantly, but this update is amazing. Great job. You guys worked very hard on this, I can tell. I just want to thank you for still caring about the game and giving us amazing new features."
"It is very enjoyable to play these types of games especially simulators but this one is by far the best, but the only thing is that I wish to tweak is to have more places instead of just the airport and the city and the country maybe somewhere else or even a modification in the city making it look like Vegas or just cool places for veiwers and cars to go in and explore."
"Wow. This game has changed. I remember playing this a long while ago on the old family iPad with my siblings. It was so fun to play back then. And it has changed so much since then. And not for the worse, arguably it's gotten better. The graphics are better, runs smoother and better customisation. It still has the same damage features but is still nicely realistic when you crash. The only reason this isnt 5 stars is because there is no online feature. I'd happily give it 5 starts if that existed"
"This game is really good if you want to play simulation games offline. The graphics are great on cars but they are terrible on buildings and NPC cars. But way too many ads...Every 5 minutes, there is a commercial advertisement. If these ads are just removed them from the game, It will be really good, I think everyone is going to agree that the commercial ads every 5 minutes are absolutely annoying when you are trying to do a stunt. But with this excluded, the game is amazing."
"There is a bug and it should be fixed. When I'm in medium graphic it turns into low graphic. Please fix the bug ASAP. And please add multiplayer and remove all ads. Please add people in the city,off-road and airport. Game is ok so I give it 4/5. If these bugs are fixed , and the multiplayer is added to the game, I would give it 5/5."
"TL;DR: Solid game but ads make it 4 star. Overall the game is pretty solid. It's engaging, rewarding, and fun to play. However, the game is riddled with adds even while your on ""trials"" and ""radars"" and ""destructions"" etc. This game is so good, but the adds get in the way of that. P.S: Devs, I love what you're doing with the game. It's amazing seeing all the new updates you and. I remember the first publicly available version of this game and loving it, now I love it even more."
"This new update is amazing 👏. But there are some bugs- 1 ) If you get in the way of a plane which is about to fly, the plane will then fly in a weird manner stopping mid air. 2) If you managed to make a random car upside down , the cars behind it will also stop and will just clash. (I don't know this one is feature or a bug)."
It's okay can you possibly add like a desert area and and an icey area that would be cool maybe add more roads and fix the bugs with the ads the kinda suck they so etines don't work and there's times I play the ad for the bonus points and it will crash so please fix and more cars and maybe add some music maybe great game is it controller compatible? I really like the high def graphics
"I have been playing this game for two months and I really love this game. This game has cool vehicles and very good landscapes.The game is overall great but the developer should add more cars like supra , civic and more off-road vehicles. Add more landscapes like river and a full off-road track. Add more modes like racing and more challenges. Add more car tuning features like firing exhaust , more colour options ,spoilers changes and especially engine tuning.I hope you will improve this game."
"This game is truly amazing, the graphic, cars, location, etc. But you could do little better by adding missions, npc, more locations and most importantly try to add other vehicles. You should add races and more challenges. BTW this is a good game after all 😊."
Have played this game a few years now and wow has it changed got the game for the first time in 2018 although I would like to see future updates that bring out multiplayer/online games that you can create and join and also I'd like to see a test drive features for cars that you are looking to buy and can't afford yet but overall this game is really fun the crash physics could be a bit more better but if all these were fixed or added it be a easy ***** stars
"I like this game a lot! Many cars to choose from, occasional gold coins (with choice of getting more with ad). 4 stars though because there are many commercial breaks and almost every time I pause the game to itch an ad pops up. I would definetly give 5 stars if less ads. Otherwise, cool game"
"I really think there should be a multiplayer mode so i can play with my friends, also it would be a lot more fun with police that chase you when you do something wrong. Maybe make it so we can get out of the car and run around like GTA. Also there is WAY to many Ads."
"This game is awesome, but there are some more things I'd love to see in this game. Firstly being more maps where you could explore further, other than the city, airport, and off road area. Along with the Porsche Taycan Turbo S being included into this game. The Cybertruck is alright, but I feel there could be more. Hence the 4 star rating."
"This is a great game, good physics. I say good because when you hit a car it has no weight. Graphics-bit of anti aliasing needed because I keep seeing gaps in textures The ai I've never seen better in terms of speed limits The AI actualy seems to go at a deecent speed The AI is better than forza horison 5 Overal 9/10"
"I love this game a lot ,I have been playing it from 2016 and I can see axesinmotion had made a lot of updates but ther only 26 cars at least make 5 to 9 cars that are not sport say like a Toyota or a mazda or a Nissan or even a Renault and just 1 sport car a new CAMARO! And I rated 4 stars because of the drift button if you go to the airport and you drift the car spins out of control it supposed to just move and for better quality why do u have to download it for megabytes. THANKS AXESINMOTION"
"Please make it so if a player crashes into the AI NPC automatic cars, they crash but, every time, they get back up and drive again! That's so unrealistic and boring. People who never play this game before may accidentally mistaken it for Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA 5) then they get angry and rage quit because they can't crash the cars. In GTA 5, there are NPC humans, cars, players, weapons, buses, highway, realistic sun graphics, and subway trains."
Alright. The gameplay of this game is perfect. I love the improvements to the roads. Only one problem. The megaskins. 20 bucks for a cosmetic change? A bit pricey for me. Still a good game.
This game has the best graphics.but when I enter the 4x4 car and set the camera mode to first person then it looks like a supercar from inside.this game can be improved a lot by adding some more maps and destinations. Nitros should also be added. I hope we could play multi-player in the next update
I want more features in this game like more realistic physic and pls fix this thing that cars are picking up their speed too fast like in 2 sec and ig was a offroad make this thing more realistic and expand map size and add race like thing like Forza horizon game... But yeah I'll keep play this game if you guys read my this review and fix this things I'll be happy this is game is good for now make it more batter and realistic with physics 🙏🙏
The game is great but I wish there were more maps and you could play online and the steering wheel are the same I wish they were different and more upgrades for your vehicle 😢 I really love game but I wish it could get an update
This game is straight up awesome and has a really big city after the remodeling update every single update is very nice but i have a small problem My phone is Samsung a22 5g and it is unable to download ultra and high presets no matter what's My internet speed and how much internet I have the medium and low presets Are alright but I downloaded the game for the high end graphics so the bug fix will greatly be appreciated . Will give 5 stars if bug fixedq
"There's only one reason why it's not getting a five star review, consider adding more customization options. Like hoods and side skirts, in short add more customizations. Playing through the game and finding gold to earn cars is fun but once it is done, wraps and colour customization just doesn't make someone feel like it's worth driving or finding coins anymore. Please consider this."
"This game is very good and I love it but there are some suggestions. 1: You SHOULD add more cars, megaskins, and more types and colors for better looks and a bigger worldwith new areas. 2: Pls do add more graphics to the NPC cars and buildings, I mean, they look like trash so do add graphics to it. 3: pls consider adding new modes like rally, racing and multiplayer ect. So we can play with friends & family. I don't mind how much ever time it takes I just want it to be interesting othw. I love it"
"This game is amazing!!! I play from 4 years there a lot of improvement in this update. But there is very enough cars that's make me bore and the game also became boring, because I unlocked all cars, so plzz add more cars🙂"
"This is a wonderful game!!!!!!! I am playing this game for almost 7 years and it's graphics, then vs now are changed a lot, superb controls, cars, maps and many more. But please remove these ads😒 they are very annoying whenever I want to do a stunt the game shows advertisement plz fix this bug, overall it's a fantastic game🙂"
This game needs a lot of improvement 1.bug-every 5 minutes commercial advertisement it should be removed 2.bug-every car should have different interior but it has same interior for all cars 3.bug-there should be indicators for this game 4.bug-the graphics of the buildings and npc cars are very 👎 bad it should be improved. None other than it is a very very good simulation game in cars.
"The game is very good and i am playing it from 2018 , the most demanded thing in this game is 360 angle view, which is very important, now all cars game have 360 view , pls i request u to add 360 angle view camera, Thank you very much"
"I was trying to find a good racing game and this was the BEST! if u wait for the high qaulity graphics, its SO COOL! Amazing controls, just needs better handling. but its a really good game!"
"I love this game and it a real life simulater, but the only problem is that it is not multiplayer so I can't play with my friends. And also that you go round and round the same place so please make new areas to find out."
"FANTASTIC game, I got a cool new skin for my first car (the one you start off with) and I'm loving it, great game I highly recommend it. But one thing, wouldn't it be nice to have like a button to test drive the cars u want to use but can't cus u don't have enough money? Also it would be nice to have like a multiplayer button where u could join/create worlds to play with friends."
I've been playing this game for 2 years it was before yesterday when I found it had an update... I updated and played it today... I was at 998km and was about to unlock buggati divo and now it can only be obtained by VIP pass... Think about those people who worked soo hard and were about to reach 1000km when this happened PLEASE FIX THIS OR JUST GIVE ME MY CAR WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO GET BY HARDWORK OF 5 WEEKS 😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😠😢😭😭😠😠😠😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
"I am playing this game from 2020, All the things like Graphics, Controls, Map & Cars are extremely good. There many Challenges, Destruction & Radar mode. But, there is one problem that you cannot play this Game with your Friends. I Request from ""Axes in Motion"" to make this Game Multiplayer."
"Best update ever in this game. Kudos to you guys 👍🏻 . Really like the dynamic camera angle while speeding the car , did a great job 🔥👍🏻"
"Only two things - one, it is very laggy. Two, from the 2015 edition the interior of Every car has been the same. It would be better if you change it accordingly for every car. Otherwise the game is very good. Super graphics."
"This game is great. I love it and I play it everyday. I love the cars and maybe you could add some new ones like the Bugatti Bolide. One suggestion from me is that maybe you could create a way to change the sensitivity of all the steering options. Besides that, this game is great."
"Amazing game 5 stars for that but -1 because i find that there needs to be more cars like supercars and hypercars because theres only 11 supercars/hypercars and 5 off road, 3 classics, 7 regular cars, i find that there needs to be more supercars and one design id love to see is in the airport have the walls taller in that half circle pit, love this game ever since it came out"
Really love the game but the reason for 4 is the always freezes and I have to wait. Please fix the glitch but either than that the game is awesome
Amazing for drifting. But I would like a few changes 1)make the graphics look good 2)make it easy to earn coins
I like the game but those coins are hard work to collect them and reach to 1000 km mark and then i got the bugati divo 😄😄😄 and my mark is to buy the koenigsegg jesko and to finish this game im almost finish and i uninstalled it because it was boring and then download it again it was hard work 🙄 Ooooooooooooooooo it was hard work AAAhhhhhhhhhhh oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo yup 😭
I love this game! Sadly online is immposible bc of how the game is made but I have a problem: my game doesn't want to update bc my friend has the update but I don't... pls fix that
When I am driving the car it was too fast I just want to reduce the speed (km/h) so that's why I rated 4 stars but your game is quite good.
"graphics and gameplay are good, but the sound effects can be improved."
"Very good game and also very good graphics combination. Please add bridges in city and also in off road , and also add gass station in all maps."
"It's commendable the cosmetic tweaks to Extreme Cityscape less square in March 2023 uploaded updates I have already collected all 26 vehicles in the game with a credit balance of $500,000+ remaining the next update another set of vehicles for the garage collection would be a positive tweak and maybe the road around the airport joining up rather than the double dead-ended variety you have at present the airport could accommodate a perimeter ring-road maybe a dockyard connection route"
Easily one of the greatest and best car game on mobile .. i liked it so much . But i only want one thing is car races with other players or with bots .. if this happens we will have open world and also car racing game in one game ♥️😍😍
"I love this game! It is so fun. It even has cars. I love cars. There cool. But there's just one prob, my cars and money and everything are updated back! But forget it."
I am starting to play this game in 2018.at first time this was good game and now I am playing it again.there are lot lots of changes than 2018.this game is awesome 💯😎.good job.but there is a little problem with ads.fix it then 5of5.
"Very nice and new updates are awesome, But you can change the in of the car 🚗 . In the all cars interface is having one culture. Pl update that thing ."
"Nice game and nice updated graphics and nice collection of cars but add some cars and new cars and add some more new city and extend the route map ,but i game is awesome"
"Nice game ,there is no Finish line ,having fun, endless game, realisitic graphics.but the reason that I give 5-1=4 stars,please add multiplayer racing,so I will give back 5 stars😊"
"Great game! Graphics and good, and I like the ways you that you can control the car, but I would really like to expand the maps. Like maybe we could unlock different cities or countrys. Because it gets a little boring, but overall, I like everything about it!"
"This game is an absolute gem from its very beginning all the way to now. I personally played the game originally many years ago before this new UI and to see its constant support is great. Despite the good though, there is a small problem; monetization. This game is full of passes you can buy which isn't the issue, rather the issue is a pay wall existing for skins that aren't even advertised. Take the heritage GT skin, im a massive fan of the car and I would of rather see an an ad wall."
"I enjoyed it a lot, but the reason i'm giving it 4 stars is the car in the destruction mode. It's literally the worst car in the game, because it turns awfully. If i try to turn right, it has probably like a second of delay, so please fix it."
"This is a great game , one of the best but there is a few downsides to this amazing game. 1 there is no account option so you cannot move an account to a different device or you accidentally delete the app and no progress saved , and can you use a different camera type it's just boring with the non movable camera so you can't see a 360° angle , other than that it's great! I highly recommend this app😁😁 oh and I miss the lamborghini reventon , its like the mascot of the game"
"This game is really amazing but it gets boring some times because we can't do much in this game, there are only 3 maps and there is nothing to do! They should add multiplayer or add something new to the game because of this i am giving 4 star but the graphics are unbeatable we can even customize graphics 😍 so I like this game so much."
I've played this game for a long time. It's got very good potential for a sandbox car game. But when they put really good skins behind pay walls it makes me really annoyed. Instead of real life money please use the in game coins. The prices will be high though since they are unique. If you want to stay on this pay wall money path then that's ok. But please allow the final cars (The fastest one in the game) new skin to be able to be bought with in game money.If you see this please send a reply.
"This game is awsome and the graphic is incridable but there are some problems in control and in earning money. The airport is good but there are no more places for driving. I had getting bored with this game. So, add some place, wide area, driving modes, people, racing types"
"This game is amazing. This was a childhood game I used to play, until the tablet with it was lost. (I found it again). I rediscovered the game, albeit on another device and I played it. There was no difference, as the game is true to what it originally was. I love it!!! 4 stars though for a little too much ads, but wonderful."
"So this game was cool, just the old versions,they not unlocking cars with coins/moneys, they have to take some kind of badges like thing and one I rated four because of the cars,they have to unlock it using coins or something, but why, also the graphics look weird and you can't get out of the map only airplanes,hey Axes In Motion, can you fix these all it would be cooler and one last AIM its remove the ads and can you make the bundles yousing coins from the game also where did the airplanes go?"
This game is very good it gives new felling of car driving but there is a problem please increase the maps link desert snoye and other maps
This game is fantastic I am playing this game since 2019 but now the the game is totally change but it's is fantastic. But ads are so annoying 🙄 these ads are always showing on screen while playing the game and video ads always come after ever 2 or 3 minutes plzz fix this other wise the game is fantastic
Why ads if its an offline game🤔 if you make it multiplayer it will be acceptional🙂 and proboply make the game much popular👀fun 👌and cool 😎plz🙏 do this plz🙏 make it multiplayer👫 I will be so grateful🙏 for that if it happens and will give it five stars.⭐🌠🌟⭐🌠
I am playing this game since 4 years and it is my favorite game. graphics are op!!! About the ads you need to just off your internet and no ads will be shown to you. I will rate it 9/10 because the graphics of npc cars and building's are too low.
Axes in motion thanks for creating this game love the sports cars. Although my suggestion is please add the bmw i8 to the game ASAP and try to improve the game such that they can be refueling cars etc I'd like to get another update this please add the BMW i8 ASAP. Another suggestion is about the skins. The skins of the cars are supposed to be accessed online which is not quite fair on behalf of fellow gamers like myself at least make this feature offline and you will make a big one
It is best in graphics but the map should more bigger that we can explore more things in game..
I play this game it is good but I feel alone in this game put multiple player option in this game and make people in this game we must die the car can not blast please do it in other abdate
"This game is AWESOME, I love the graphics and the cars. The only thing is I would love for it to have a Toyota Supra mk4"
"I like the game so much, i like the game more than Need for Speed. But, can you please add an open world and different(real) car interiors?"
Nice game with best quality graphics but my suggestion is that there should be more places for driving it would be better for an user
"it is a great game but it needs to be more realistic and the game needs more cars like lexus,v8,porche,Mercedes and many other cars"
Great game with detail real life counter part mechanic. however the right turn drift camera angle on third person view makes you can't see where you are going. Please fix this third person view right turn drift camera angle. I recommend to download this game if you are looking for simulation to real life driving but not crazy for drifting as of now. If you want crazy drifting let's all hope this camera angle get fix soon so for those who want to do crazy drifting can download this as well
"It is a GOOD game. In fact, it is one the best mobile open world driving game i've evrr played. The shifting from 1-4 is kinda to fast imo, make it slower so it'll be more realistic. The crash physics of this game needs some improvements also. And the exhaust sound of the cars are the same in most of the cars, you guys should improve them and add more exhaust sounds. My suggestions : add automatic opening gate to the airport and make the map biggerbigger by adding more places."
Best game for driving my skills improve.this car design in luxury. new update new cars add please.
This is an wonderful game with high quality and an open world. But contains lot of ads within it. The sounds of the cars is kind of same for eveything.. just some cars little different exhaust sounds.
"This game is brilliant. The graphics are amazing. Just so you could add few customizations... The side view, terrain map, and most importantly car radio."
I like this game very much and I played it hundred times and i like this update also but if the makers of the game will add a desert and a train station can make it more amazing
"This game is very good.but,pls add race and online mode.also add new cars because it is very easy to bore with 26 cars and add new customisation like:- engine,silencers,rearbumper,frontbumper,spoiler,etc and improve drift system."
This games car is not realistic. Back Fire not give dob. This games is so good but back fire is so important on Car plzz add back fire in car I hope. U next update add this cars backfire ? .
"It has good graphics and I love the destruction theme of it. the only thing that bothers me is that when you high in the air you sometimes glitch through the border or ground, though I still recommend it!"
"So... overall it's not bad. But 1 thing that is a little unintuitive, that on your chest history list, all contracts are bold, so it is difficult to tell when some1 sends you a new chat. O.k. Other apps, only new chats are bold, & read messages are not. This is a, bit annoying, because it always makes me think that I have a ton of new messages, & then an frequently disappointed when I realize that it doesn't mean that. I know this now, but is still annoying."
"I have been using WhattsApp for years without any problems, that I recall. One improvement I would like to see is a notification for outgoing messages without having to open the app and going to the message info. One other suggestion would be to change colors of the notification checkmarks for delivery/read/seen notifications. It's rather difficult for old eyes to tell the difference."
"I don't use this app for anything fancy, just to text with a friend who occasionally goes overseas so we can use wi-fi and not entail international text charges. It may be specific to my device, but when I use the ""Export"" feature (choosing to save without media), half the time it opens Google Drive instead of the file manager I always select. Then I have to exit out of Drive and wade through the whole menu thing again."
"I like this app. Most of my friend and family groups have just migrated to it because of the ease that voice notes and video chat provide. That said, I wish there was an option to limit the picture and video auto-download by individual/group chat and not for the whole app. I have some chats where I like keeping pics, but others, not so much, so the fact that I have to go into my folders to manually delete is a bit annoying. That's why I took away a star. Otherwise, it's a pretty good app."
This is by far the best messaging app that I have found. It is absolutely perfect for communicating with anyone domestic or overseas in nearly every way imaginable. I have a few gripes. Pictures are degraded quite a bit. I don't see an option to send them in a higher quality. I also hate the the five person limit for sending a message to.
"This app has done everything I have asked it to do, and has been excellent in many ways. The only complaint I have is that it is inconsistent regarding Do Not Disturb status and screen sleep. I have had it notify me when DND is on and also had it silent from the same user (I only use the app for one person). Other times the phone will go to sleep while on extreme battery saver (Android) but there are times when it will stay active for several minutes (10+) while on extreme battery saver."
A good app to have for traveling. It lets you contact people on a plane where texting isn't allowed. Also good for international trips if you want to use wifi and cheapen out on foreign plans. I only download it for these purposes because other than that I can just normal text/call. I believe their ads about carriers posting your private info online is probably a scare tactic to make you get an otherwise useless app. Never had it happen to me nor know anyone who had it happen to them.
"Glitchy backup to Google Drive. The preset schedule is at 0200hrs on daily basis. But recently, not only it's having difficulties to finish the backup process, it appears your app has chosen to disobeying its schedule. That still cool to me. But the whole backup process normally will messing with my connectivity. Therefore, I could barely access the network while Whatsapp updating its database. You're part of a big brand. How could this slipped under your nose ?"
"Please provide an option to view data on when you viewed a recieved message. Much like the sender can. The sent time, delivered time, and the viewed time. All three are very important factors to know your impact on the sender and recipient you are interacting with. Yes you can make note metally or otherwise of when you viewed it, yet a log would be useful, as otherwise would be quite a task. Also, please include supports for Google Chromecast. Video calls on my TV using my phone camera👍"
"I use this app on a daily basis and haven't run into any issues. I work night shifts, though, and sometimes can't text people right away as it's too early in the morning, so a 'timed message' feature would be very helpful. Similar to a scheduled mail just setting the time and date for a text to be sent so I don't have to worry about forgetting/texting too early"
"Overall is all great because I can communicate with many people with less data but the fact that my images and videos are being compressed and that makes the quality to appear low bothers me, a lot mind you. Even when I choose best quality on the setting, it doesn't change anything really. It would be best to make an option for people who want to save data and the one for those who prefer better quality than loss of data."
"The app is overall amazing for communication, and it's very easy to use as well. I don't really have any issue with it, but there is this new update in tablets, where you get a split screen view. I do not really like it, and not only that, it has minimised the space as well. Nor could you revert it back since it's an update. I wish that they could work it back to the way it was, because there are many people like me, who do not really like it....hopefully whatsapp would do something about it."
"WhatsApp is one of the best communication platform that I use and I have used it for a long time without any problems. But in the recent update the split layout of the home screen is not good. It works better in PC but not in tablets. I would kindly ask the authorities to remove the split layout and change it back to the original one. Other than that , it's a great app to use for communication purposes."
"New split screen on surface duo (and I think all folding phones is a pain, should be an option, not mandatory. Next update, no fix to the split screen, but now you canswip to follow on other comments... I guess because the screen is too narrow. The last version, everything works, the update is a downgrade.. Junk."
"App is wonderful. But even after these much features, you are failed to give an option to export multiple files. It's possible in iPhone (iOS). If someone send me multiple documents/images and I have to email them, the only option left with me is to save them one by one, and then I can attach it to mail. There is no option to export/save them all at once. Please work on it."
"A couple of issues: 1. When selecting photos to be sent, it no longer shows the phone's gallery folders by default. Very inconvenient to have to access it through the 3 dots on top left hand corner. 2. Unable to select multiple photos to be sent at once. Extremely inconvenient. Please look into it and fix them. Thanks"
"The latest version of WhatsApp in the tablet, split the screen is a problematic but the technical team do hard for it. They fix the previous issues and now it's very easy to find out proper text and swipe replying and more. I am very happy with the latest version of WhatsApp. But there should have to be a option to manage the SPLIT SCREEN."
"Raju 11/26/22 I had a very good experience of using this application, and it's so useful for the person to have a conversation with the person who is far from us. just one suggestion you must add up the music in the story uploading so the people who wants to add music with photo or a video can be possible caasily. Must do this change and update it soon, people will so happy to use it. Thank you very much."
"It's awesome, but sometimes I feel difficulty regarding open it because it takes too much time, and backup option is also not working as well because whenever I try to take backup it never works. So please check it if possible! However, currently I'm not able to watch anyone's status and even the videos also not loading as well 😬. So, it's become headache for me. But, still I give it 4 stars because it is outstanding in use and help me to talk with my kith and kins."
"It is a great app but I wish it didn't delete images and audios along with it when I uninstall it. I know you can back up your data but it's really troublesome when you don't get much data to download the back up. So I'd really appreciate it if WhatsApp images, videos and audios would still remain in my device even if I uninstall the app. Thank you."
"EDIT: 05.05.23 ""Side by Side View"" is now able to be toggled in settings. This choice improves the experience on high resolution phones. Developers have listened - THANK YOU. Star rating updated to reflect this change. Split View has ruined what used to be a really functional App. Please provide a toggle for high-resolution phone users to be able to turn off Split View as it's poorly thought through and unworkablevb"
"Kindly review the mode of sending messages. From the latest update, message (voice notes and image) do not automatically send after network interruption has been restored. You always have to now go back and click on retry before it could be sent. WhatsApp is indeed the best messaging App. Be sure to do something, Thanks."
"There is one problem I am recently facing that is we can't send photos in document format all together, only first photo selected will be delivered other selected photos doesn't. I have to select one photo at a time to send it in documents that's too time consuming. Do something about this problem . A suggestion also - While we post something on status , sometimes we do spelling mistakes and we have to delete the whole status to put correct spelling. Provide a feature of editing status caption."
"Everything is good but recently I'm facing a particular issue with sending multiple files. I have uninstalled and reinstalled whatsapp, cleared all data, tried everything but it won't be fixed. Whenever I'm trying to send multiple documents, it just let me send one document at a time. I'm asking the authorities to help me fix this issue please."
The app is great and I love the way your team is fast when fixing bugs. There's just one suggestion... It would be great if I could send directly from my Google drive. I recently uploaded all my files to my drive which left my phone storage empty. It would be great if I could post on my status as well as send attachments from my Google drive. Thanks in advance ♥
"This is a very nice app. My personal rating is 8 out of 10 because I don't like the backup process here, it would have been better if there was a permanent backup system, I never had to do the backup. Also, to see the active status here, I have to go into someone else's inbox, like in messenger if the profile picture. It would have been much better to see the active status with this and also it takes a lot of time to view your profile It would have been great if there was a profile icon next...."
"I personally like this app, I've been using it for years. It's great but I only have one problem, due to technical limitations the iOS emoji keyboards I've installed go back to default system after sending it. I would really appreciate it if the developers could help with this problem. Thank you!"
"I don't know why people are giving less than 3stars cos Whatsapp is a very reliable and unique app. The only problem I have is that it reduces the quality of images which I understand because they are trying to optimize it to avoid excessive data consumption. But every thing else is top notch. Infact you can even share your location to who you want to, with new updates you can use poll and other features to make group chats more fun and lively, and to also get choices from your contacts."
"The app is nice for communication and interaction. But copying of single words from and entire group should be introduced, i.e, when an individual wants to copy words from a group of words they mustn't copy everything. Thanks. Please also work on how messages are forwarded. Look at telegram and learn how to forward messages. Fast and easy."
It's perfect but there's one problem that I have with it that makes me REALLY ANGRY! The amount of space of a video that you can fit into a message is appalling! I tried to fit an almost 10 minutes long video into a message and it only fits 1/3 of it! Plus it took about 5 minutes to process the 3 minute long video!
"Well the problem am face in this app is no 1 I can't be able to open some links being sent to me on WhatsApp. 2 some times when listening to voice note the volume will be too low that I can not hear the voice, even if I raised the volume still the same. 3 some times when someone called me on video call when I click accept it won't pick up the video call"
"This is the coolest app for texting and sharing. There's a desktop version available, too, which I assume you can use simultaneously. The only issue I noticed is that it doesn't send out photos as smoothly as before. You have to try it a few times or just give up."
Very useful app. Infact never used a better appp for chatting than whatsapp. Some new features are very useful like the reation emojis and communities. But some features are getting old day by day and many prople want new versions like the colors for writing a status and the fonts. Thank you for making such a useful app for less size app. Please also make a new feature so that we can send status for more than 30 seconds.
it's an AMAZING app -- jus sucks you can't sync it to all your devices instead you can only use one. I'd definitely be way happier & love this app more if I could access WhatsApp on my phone my tablet & my laptop. sometimes my phone dies & I still need to be able to see/use the app. definitely something that would be greatly helpful for me & im sure hundreds of thousands or even millions & BILLIONS of the WhatsApp users.
"WhatsApp is a great tool undoubtedly, and the new feature which allows you to use the same account on two phones is awesome. However, I don't understand why I shouldn't be able to update my status with my secondary device especially when my secondary device isn't connected to the internet"
"The app is quite good and it's my favorite app though. I just got a problem with it recently. My account has been completely banned from using whatsapp and I don't know why. So I had to register a new number, but they just banned my number again within 3 days... It's quite annoying, frustrating and stressful, so please solve this problem I have ASAP!!!"
"This app is fun. You can chat with your friends with having your conversation end to end encrypted. However, there is one issue: Old medias failing to download. And I have a cool suggestion: Add a feature which makes you schedule a message to be sent. For example, if you have a message set to be sent at 10:00, then it will be sent at 10:00"
"Hi there, I wanted to leave my feedback on the app. While I really enjoyed the overall experience and found the app to be very useful, I did notice that it did not have the feature for face ID unlock. This is a feature that I have come to expect from most apps that deal with sensitive information, and as a result, I could not give it a full 5-star rating. However, I still think the app is great and worthy of a 4-star rating because of its user-friendly interface."
"After the last update, notification dot is not appearing on the WhatsApp icon. When I switch off and switch on it appears for first time and stops showing. It was working well till two days back before recent update. Please resolve. Thanks"
"Good overall, but please fix the following, if sound is muted or vibrate mode is on, whatsapp video status still reproduce with sound. SOMETIMES when a status is a video with sound and i open it, then close it before it ends, i can still hear the sound in background, even if app is minimized. I recall this didn't happen. I have a samsung galaxy s9+. Thanks."
"This app is good for sending messages, everyone knows that it is easy to send, it joins quickly, that's why I like this app, can you give me another suggestion, that we need an option to edit it. that is, we typed a message by mistake and sent it. but we didn't like delete it, but there will be to edit the message. so we need edit mode an sent message."
"This app is like a default messenger. It's amazing and a key for mobiles. But there is a problem that we can't load any file such as video probably not more than I think 64 MB. So, it becomes difficult. So please look into it to kindly increase the limit as short videos cost much MBs. Rest is amazing. Features and new Emojis are good. Keep up."
"I like the app, but I wish they improved their app so it can send or receive more megabytes (you’re limited to almost 2.5 minutes of data a day, another problem is it does not have cloud storage to store data and aftera few days all your videos or pictures will be gone and whatsapp asks you to ask the sender to send you that data again which sometimes is not possible. I hope the CEO of whatsapp make the correction."
"Its a great app! With the recent implementation of far olderly requested features, here are some recommendations for newer features: - with the display of recent messages (of unopened chat), it should display the last time i opened that chat. - individual chats and groups should be displayed in separate panels. - add custom timer for muting chats."
"App is great But here's some bugs I experienced on my low end phone The image filter malfunctions, most of the time it doesn't respond Also can you implement some sort of caching of stickers and list of contacts on first load so subsequent loading will be fast On my phone opening stickers and selecting contact to send something to takes quite some time Overall great app I wish to be part of the development team one day ☺️"
"i love the app, use it every day, but i really really wish you'd add a way to organize stickers or rename them so they're easier to look for, since the only way to save them is by adding them all to favorites, it becomes a mess and it's a struggle to look for the sticker you want"
My faith has been restored. The new update was pretty bad for.....reasons. But honestly I kinda dug the new split screen format. But what truly was horrible was that you couldn't swipe at messages to reply to them directly. Thankfully the brand new update has fixed that! So all is well now.
"V. Good. Needs notification sound option with word ,one which cannot be ignored.once I have granted all permissions I'm told to remove permissions to free up space. Needs method option for reading messages. I would like option to record my calls. Sometimes difficult to select copy and paste messages. S10plus."
"After the latest update or after the update of OS to Android 13, WhatsApp is not allowing to send multiple photos in document format. Please fix this issue. It's too irritating and time consuming to send photos one by one when the number of photos is quite more."
"Mostly amazing app! My usual messages app is not allowing me to use a group chat or send pics/vids anymore so it's fixed that problem. Only downside-I can't use it offline. Is it meant to be an online only app, because I need to use it for sending pictures and videos and use group chats. Otherwise, awesome app."
"Decent and It's getting better but still far behind a app like telegram in terms of features , no games , no apps built in , no programmable bots , no chat groups , no feed only groups , telegram just does it all better .. take note meta ✌️ Trying to create a avitar doesn't work once you choose a skin tone it freezes and won't continue"
"Hey, We are unable to send photos as a document more than one, We can send one photo as a document. If we select more than one photo we can't. This is happening in version 2.23.7.80 only. Request to revert back and give a good one."
"Pretty good app for school groups. The only downside is it downloads files from others to view. It's just a minor inconvenience more than anything though, as you can delete them on your device once you're done viewing the files."
This changing update is too much annoying for me...I used WhatsApp from last 10 years..and my experience is too good..but this version is totally spoiled my mood..I used small tablet when I talking to someone is hard to type something. I think maximum people faced the something..even I didn't take my online Classes and submit assignments..I never thought I faced this type of problem in my future.. even my friends circle Don't like this version.. annoying experience ever and ever I faced....
This last update is making more negative changes than positive as a tablet user. The split screen is very difficult to navigate and the thin column is not quite reliable. Requesting to fix this issue which is a problem to thousands of users.
One of the best messenger apps Ever... Current version is my favourite among all the previous others... Can you make it possible to form groups in which you send statuses like Snapchat has? Because it is not possible to everytime check the whole contact list and select... It will be very convenient if we have group sharing options...
"I like the app, but updates weren't getting worse till date. In the new update, Archived section shows on top! I mean why a person would archive to keep the messages on top? Also, when I forward an image to another contact, it sends only the image and not its caption. Who would like to write caption again and again? Please improve the app. Otherwise my rating is 5 stars. Thank You."
"Something changed in the latest update and I can no longer join groups from my phone or laptop. It keeps telling me I need to update the app, which I already did, and round in circles I go. Really frustrating that everything was working fine before. already tried deleting cache, uninstalling and reinstalling, etc. Still same issue."
"Everything is good about the app,easy friendly,catchy interface etc but.... the search button is not good. It only searches the keywords ONLY ONCE which is frustrating bcoz we have to search each and every message later. Next is backup.. the backup starts at 2 am and doesn't finish till morning pls take a look at it and ask your developers to manage it properly"
"I love the app, but could you make a version where you can edit any messages already sent incorrectly. I look forward to this. Bcos so many atimes people makes mistake of words in a message, but got to realized the error after been sent. So making avenue to edit any incorrect sent message would go a long way. Thanks for checking this out"
"I have a suggestion on search option in chat. Can you add ""Search Chat By Date"" option. It will be very helpful to directly go to the specific chats and read it whenever I need instead of scrolling down all chats. It will save so much of time which i use it in scrolling all the chats... Please think over it... Thank you ❤️"
"It's good but like the avatar thing doesn't seem to be working for me...but other than that I can chat w my friends and ft them...BUT when I'm face timing my friends and I open Google, it mutes my microphone and they won't be able to hear me until Google is closed,idk if everyone has this problem but it bugs me i hope that can be changed soon. But I think Whatsapp is a good place to chat on"
WhatsApp is an amazing and useful app that allow us to send and receive photos and videos quickly and reliable also we can talk over video call and voice call. I could give 5 stars but it need to be more secured. I have a suggestion that WhatsApp should give us more feature to pinning more chats because it is set to only 3 pinning chats. Overall App is good to use and communicate with our relatives and international friends over any country. WhatsApp please give me reply if you are reading this
"The app is great really but it would be more convenient if the sharing options were directly linked to other applications like gmail,bluetooth, shareit e.t.c such that when you receive a file from whatsapp you can send/share it without opening file manager."
Really loved this app until recently when it stopped automatically saving photos to gallery. Despite a number of queries still no solution and judging by queries on internet a lot of people are experiencing the same problem. Seems like Google aren't interested in fixing this problem or maybe they don't know how to because they aren't doing anything about it. But then again that's Google for you isn't it.
"This app keeps getting worse, i lost all the videos that were sent to me in my gallery. I no longer can download any videos sent to me, nor can i watch a status containing a video cause it won't load. Mediocre, considering unistalling it for good. *(Fixed)*"
"Best app for communication. Can we have the option of sending multiple documents at once again? The current change is annoying, we can't be sending a single document when we have a lot of them."
"Hi, please can you add the feature to tag everyone in a group chat. That would be very helpful for communicating in a large community that some people in it maybe has a very busy daily activities and sometimes couldn't see our message (could be an important information). Yet it would be a little annoying to tag @ every each one of them. It's only a suggestion from me, thank you."
Perfect app. It's very reliable for talking to others in other places. and for those who are saying the split screen is annoying 1. go to settings 2. go to chats 3. turn it off
1. Please give us theme colors.. same green for years is really boring now. 2. Why chat wallpers are zoomed and cropped?? Even when I am using right size photo..still it's zooming and cropping every image and that spoils resolution of photos. 3. Watsap profile picture size can't be changed :(
"It's high time that you introduce a pinned msg option in chats especially in group chats. Important msgs can get buried quickly in group chats so it will be really great if we can pin a msg within the chat so that it will not go unnoticed by the group members. Overall, it is a great app with many great features. Thank you"
"I have used WhatsApp for over years and its amazing! However, I would like to suggest you guys make some sort of role like Discord. Discord can make their own role on their server. So, I think when you guys add some roles, but you can create it on your own then it will be an amazing update! But, I enjoy this app so much, so thank you and please comment this review from me :D"
I have spent many short breaks at this hotel. Really friendly and helpful staff there. The location is reasonably close to the city centre. Easy to stay here with a car too. Very comfortable bedrooms which have access by a lift. I was there for a few days last Christmas. M Cosker (Ms)
"I really like this app, but I don't appreciate not being able to open it up unless I give you access to my contacts. It also wants me to choose which google email account to save my info on, but when I follow the instructions it doesn't give me the option to add my account. I need to get it working so I can talk to my sister in Europe."
"I've been trying to change my dp, I clicked that camera icon and then picture, but I'm only able to put my dp from my internal storage and not from Google photos. Why is it so? :| Is it only me who is having this issue. Also, after selecting the picture from Google photos, it actually shows like I'm putting it on status, like it shows the screen where u can add sticker/emojis and can type captions. Going further from there literally uploads the picture on my status!?🥲"
"A great all-rounder, would love more flexibility I would give 5 stars, heck I would pay for the option schedule to mute a group chat for a specific number of hours/days every week. As a lot of businesses use whatsapp we would love the option for scheduled down time! Otherwise super user-friendly, no glitches, absolutely love whatsapp!!"
It is very good app for anyone. Newly it has updated that without admins permission no one can join the group. It is my small suggestion that when we add any person in the group i would like to introduce themselves in short about name and other details required for the group. This must be in a form style where we can ask about the persons interest in the group. It can be for security reasons or for general knowledge about the person joining the group. All in all its has been updating. Thanks
"Restrictive. Honestly it is one of the most unfriendly messaging apps out there. I had such a difficult time trying to transfer my whatdapp data from iPhone to samsung (in fact still unable to) compared to othee messaging apps which took me less than 5 minutes to set up. In addition, the destop version has no call function. In the past you need to have you phone nearby before you can even log into the desktop version (this has improved). But the data still takes a few minutes to load every time."
"The messaging function works well, status option also has no problems but the call and video call functions definitely need some work. However one is able to add another person to a call, during the call. Media such as photos, videos, audio messages, music and documents can easily be shared with another person, group or broadcast message members. The app also has an end to end encryption privacy policy"
"1 star is taken away as the desktop version needs to improve a lot... For eg if I click on something, it takes 10 s to respond, also the app itself crashes twice first, also it always shows that notification is available but it actually isn't, another issue is with chat history, if we want to take a look at something 1week before then it loads a lot then opens it, many issues with desktop app along with grp call... New emojis are needed and the option to pin more than 3 chats should be available"
I am writing my review after four using four years this app. By this app we can send any message and video in just few seconds. But sound doesn't come clear when I do voice call and video call.
"This is one of the most convenient source for messaging but there are some bug such as the finger print security, I have enabled it for more security, and I loved it, but 2 in every 10 time it fails to ask finger print and it's little bit of concerning. Hope this will be fixed in the next update."
Best messaging app out of them all. I wish the forwarding options limits can be removed and that a sent message can be edited afterwards and you don't have a save the contact to be able to send a message to that number.
After the last updation in tablet is not comfortable. The screen had splitted in the left side is contacts and in right side is we selected contact for chat. This so uncomfortable please make a solution for this uncomfortable upadation. Please do it fastly
"Pretty cool app. Yet I have realised that it doesn't want to add sound to voice messages. I updated it all the time yet the problem stays. I just record a message and the next thing I know is that the sound does not work. It's not such a big problem, but big enough to take notice of. Otherwise it's pretty much fine."
"The edit photo is not useful. I had edited, but it had sent as new picture. This is like might as well just press the camera and choose photo and send to people. Please make the ""edit"" as real edit."
"Hye My self sakshi saxena and i'm an automation QA engineer. There is a bug in you application. You add a new feature in the status : photoes and videos choose separately, when i choose video it is showing picture instead of videos. So please fix it. It is a high severity and high priority bug. I was unable to add any video or screenshot here. Please fix it"
"The whatsapp is good and very easy to communicate and all. I would have given 5 stars but I've a problem in whatsapp web, I can't backup from it. Once my phone got reset, after that I tried to backup from whatsapp web, but finally I couldn't restore that If you put the backup option in whasapp web or to upload to drive/icloud it would be nice."
"Okay ,have to admit its good. Just trying UPI with whatsapp. One thing i dont like though is sharing the details of transaction while sending money to a non whatsapp UPI user. There is no option to share the transaction details in that case. We can only do Screenshots. It would have been better if there was an option to share the details to non whatsapp UPI User when you send them money via chat."
It is really good. I would like to give a suggestion. It would be really convenient if the user can see the groups separately like we have communities separately. And much better if the user can categorise the groups as he/she want.
"Great app by the way...... I just have one problem which is whenever I turn off my data or phone for about 2 hours or less, all the statuses will no longer reflect, both the newer and older ones......and this only happens when you've not been online for a long time but now it just happens when you've not been online for about 2 hours which can be very annoying, PLEASE FIX IT, because I can't be leaving my data on always so I don't miss any status.Aside from that problem,the app is wonderful."
"1) I didn't like the calling features, you should improve calling features like ringtone, busy or not reachable to make it regular calling platform. It can be very useful like we will not have do recharge of calling only net (data) will fulfill it. U can change the world. These telecom companies charge extra for calling u can remove that cost. Please do it fast as possible 2) there should be a option to share hd or low quality photos 3) make better file transfer feature,more length video etc"
"The app is great. However, clicking on the icon in the phone menu does not open it. It only opens when I click OPEN in Google Playstore. This makes using the app tedious. Which means all my previous messages are inaccessible when offline."
"Is any chance that you can develop a left handed mode? It is hard to send voice notes using one hand. My thumb it is not large enough to press the send button, it would be cool if we can choose which side of the screen have it. Thank you!"
"Off late, I'm unable to make WhatsApp voice calls from the app. Whenever I'm making/ receiving a call it shows the status as connecting however it never connects. Although I'm able to d WhatsApp video calls without any problems. What can be the issue here?"
"Very Useful. But every time there is an update there seem to be problems. After the latest update, clicking a message is giving a black screen. Removed app permissions as suggested in online search. Now app hangs"
"Hi WhatsApp manager, Hope you're find well, i have the request that, can you please added the duration of the video on the story WhatsApp? I mean it takes only minimal 1 minute and also can you added the feature of the songs?! Thanks again, have a great day! 💚 Best,"
"One thing that is still missing from this app that I think would be and amazing feature are scheduled send texts where you can have the option to schedule a text, or broadcast"
"I want a feature for status. Where each status you post can be for different people's view. So I don't have to update the people who view my status every time. I can have five things on my status but different people viewing the five of them without people who view my status being updated. This future was there before, but in recent update I haven't seen it anymore. I will really be glad if this was considered."
"It's really good, but now it won't let me send videos with audio. As soon as I send a video to someone or update my status, the audio is removed from the video."
"Great, robust and multi-functional communication app with more features than all the others out there. The absolute best one out there. Only issue I have recently is sharing from a just made camera video via Google photos-telegram crashes and fails to send the video directly from the camera. I have to go into telegram and hit the attachment 📎 button and select the video, then it sends. Didn't have this issue before I upgraded from Android 10 to 12 with a new phone. Please fix, thanks!"
"I really enjoy and recommend this app however there's still lots of features that can be added , and also, it has a bunch of bugs too!! As I experienced when playing a music and someone's calling then app will be closed and music will not continue playing, also auto-night mode is never worked for me , it's always in dark/light mode when I change it manually"
"Hi. I use Telegram v9.3.3 (3026) with Android 13. I think there is a problem with your new update. When I use telegram and play a sound track within Telegram sometimes it stops working and the sound track does not resume when you play it again. For example the sound track stops at minute 13 but you when it stops, it goes to minute 0. Please help to fix this problem. Thanks."
"Telegram is the best out there, with non-stop cool new updates adding brand-new features every time. But the in-app video player is awful; I remember the old version... That was far better. There has been some bugs recently as well; one is that when you send a message and press the back icon, it shows two ticks for that message, which means ""seen"" while it's not."
"Good app, relatively stable aside from a few hiccups here and there, I use it quite frequently. I wish there was a way to create folders to organize chats and groups better, as one long list can be overwhelming. For example, I'd create a folder for close friends, another for group chats, then one for channels. Would be a nice feature and perhaps something the devs can look into, even some of my friends think it's a good idea."
"I absolutely love the app and in my honest opinion, I would say it's almost perfect. I wish voice calling was a little better cause it almost never connects and I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this problem but I sometimes don't receive notifications until I actually open the app. Other than that, it's a great app with a great layout and the variety of stickers and one of my favorite features would be the video messaging, it would be nice if it was longer than one minute though."
"Nice app. But voice calling thru proxy is not good: some interferences and noises occur all the time using Wi-Fi connection only. And a very annoying issue: every time after the update, the proxy setting becomes disabled. User should activate available proxy manually. It's very inconvenient for older people who have no idea how to set it up after each update."
"Good service/app, hate having images being skipped because i tapped the right or left side of the screen trying to double-tap to zoom in or make the info disappear, whereas it used to be that it would only advance or go back when swiped. It now does both. Please include an option in the settings to control this. Other than that, it's a good app."
"See ""Overall"" praise below. But since the last update, for the first time EVER, I was *NOT* notified of new messages while the app wasn't open. Once open, the little icon appeared in the task bar. Seems like a bug--if so, needs a fix!! Overall: I really love this app, for the security and privacy features, customization options, file-sharing in storage location of choice, all the stickers, etc. If the app had video chatting and conferencing, I'd actively recruit my friends to use this."
"I have only two gripes with Telegram. The first is that the audio does not go to my wireless earpiece during calls. The second, being if it's been up for awhile, it will not switch to landscape when I turn the phone over. It would also be cool if the phone app could export chat history like the desktop version. Otherwise, it's perfect."
"It's a great app that has many useful tools and, in my opinion, one year ago was the best instant messaging application. Right now it has a few problems like: audios take about 4-5 minutes to send, even if it is an audio of only 10 seconds; a 100kb image also takes a long time about 4-5 minutes to send and even if it's just 100kb. I have good internet speed, that's not the problem. Images that are sended with self-autodestructi don't load correctly, they stay blurred."
"Pavel and Co have to fix smth. I have started using Telegram when I lived in Ukraine years ago. I can tell it's the best on the market! I took out one star only because since they added video calls, there's an issue that still presents. When I switch from voice call to video or back, it never goes automatically to the speaker or back. Never. I have to push on screen, then to find a tiny phone button and click on it to change to speaker. It's really annoying. Hope you'll fix it. Thanks for app!"
"So right off the bat, if you want to see everything, download the app from the telegram website. The app store and playstore versions will not show some groups. Only found that out when some in a group I'm in was sharing things from other pages and nothing was loading. This app gets frequently updated. Not that long ago, there was two updates in the same day. Most updates are under 80MB. The UI is decent."
"Great app. I switched from Viber after I realized that some of messages were not being delivered. Telegram seems vastly better. I just used it once to call and the sound quality was exceptional, it felt like the person I was talking to was right next to me, even though I was talking to someone on a different continent. The only thing I don't like is that I had to agree to Telegram recording my audio when I only wanted to talk to someone in a live conversation, not record voice messages."
"This annoying popup notification keeps appearing when someone sends me a message. I have turned off popup notifications and have disabled the app from appearing on top of other apps, and yet the notification still appears. After some googling, I found on reddit that it's a Samsung feature called ""smart pop-up view"", I have since disabled it for telegram (no idea why it was enabled in the first place, I obviously did not know that feature existed). All in all, good app."
I love this app. Works good for me. But recently I think I found a bug. I'm on Android 11 now on a Google pixel and I've noticed my notifications don't always work. I will miss messages from people because the push notification never goes through. It will work fine for a short time after opening app but later throughout the day I miss them. When I'm listening to music on my volume wilk drop for a notification but no sound and nothing in notifications bar. I will open the app and see messages.
I enjoy the app in the years that I've had my account. However I have recently been dealing with a couple bugs. If I search for a message in a chat it will skip months worth of text. But it only happens if I use the search bar so it's a hassle manually looking for specific texts. Hopefully this gets fixed soon. Other than that the app is great. By far one of mh favorite social media platforms.
Id love to give this app 5/5 b/c akmost everything is amazing! Secure messaging. STICKERS! Group messaging. Easy to use. I absolutely love *almost* everything. But. Voice recordings? Nearly impossible to get to work. And I KNOW its not just me. We hit play and the screen flickers black and keep pausing the recordings. Its crazy hard to listen to anything. I hope they fix this soon.
"I've been using this app since google Allo died a few years back, which though it lacked in popularity it had a lot of cute key features. Telegram is the closest I've gotten to that app, without needing to change my device's default messaging app. The one thing I really wish it could do that allo could do and I havent found any app to do, is be able to send texts that go from very large to very small text sizes. Like sending a small text like a whisper or a big text like a yell."
"Love the app in general! Long time user, long enough that I have made custom stickers and everything. But there's been a few bad changes lately, and there's literally no way to talk to a support team. Only volunteers that don't know any more than you. Sticker packs now automatically move to the top of the list when you use them. I had all my packs sorted and memorized. The sticker history is enough. Don't reorganize my packs for me!"
"It's a great app, the only con is that whenever I try to send someone a video, picture or gif, it says it sends, but it constantly buffers and the other person who I send it to can see that I tried to send either a video, picture or gif and they say that they can't see the image, it constantly buffers. Other than that, I love this app!"
"I have a pocophone f1 and after the most recent update (5.12.1) I'm not getting any notifications. I have to open the app to see if I have any messages. Before I had an issue with not getting any calls when my phone is locked (just get a messed call notification) but I could live with that somewhat but this bug is real annoying. All permissions have been granted and notifications have been reset to default in the app. -They fixed it 😁😁, thanks!"
"Just brilliant. Does everything I need it to do and more. Recent update with premium seems to have issues, with premium I can almost never downloaded images or voice messages. The app just sits on ""updating..."" Then ""connecting..."" And just flips back and forth for ten seconds before stopping the download. Hope it's fixed soon, as I love telegram but these supposed faster downloads on premium seems bunk right now."
"I enjoy using Telegram. Took me a bit to figure the nuances/differences from other apps. The only bothersome thing to me is that the people or groups I follow appear in such a random order, it's hard to find exactly the person or group I want to check. I have to really look to find it--it's so random and not alphabetized. Aside from this, it is my preferred platform because the info is not censored."
"I like the overall design of the app except there needs to be a video button 🔘 up at the top beside a call button🔘. Using video conference or chatting via video is super important.But the app doesn't have in-call video which is really frustrating, it will only let me video chat through my phone interface,not through the app. Other than that the app is fine."
"Generally great, but still some issues to improve: 1. Can't forward grouped images to groups whose slow model are enabled. The grouped images will be recognized as multiple messages. 😅 2.Audio player is quite simple. Hope you can add step backward & forward 10s options and apply multiple options for speed control, not just 2x. 🥺 3.Still, thank you for your hard work. 👍"
"Generally, I've found Telegram to be a fairly technologically advanced communications system. I'll find it useful for speaking to people internationally, because it's free and fairly reliable. The only problem that I've had with it is connection difficulty when on call. I'm hoping that these technological difficulties will be corrected soon."
"I really like this app, I've been using it for a long time, and their always adding features, the only other thing I can personally think it needs is a random chat option. Where you could type in your interests and it would try to connect you to like-minded people anonymously, if you like talking to eachother you add eachother and keep talking."
I really like Telegram and all but I don't like that when I send video messages the audio is pretty low compared to other programs. I have to talk very loud on Telegram for it to be audible from the other person and even then they must crank up their volume to full blast. I wish Telegram would fix that. I am using a Google Pixel 6 if that helps. I know it's not the phone because other programs come in loud and clear so the microphone is working perfectly but for some reason in Telegram it's low
"Telegram is very reliable in terms of messaging, sending videos or photos. There's so many groups and bots that is useful where you can download any kinds of ebooks, songs and videos like movies. My only concern is regarding the files I downloaded. Saving a song, takes several attempts to save it on my phone coz' it didn't save it's actual size in first try. In saving videos, most of the time, there is no option where I can save it to my phone, I have to manually find it on my phone data."
"I believe telegram is an incredible thing for many people. It works very well, and allows people to do and send a lot more then WhatsApp. My only thing is I want the file name of videos to be visible, at least when pressed on. I name them to organize them but no matter what menu you go to file names for pictures and videos aren't visible. That's one feature that would make it a lot better for me personally. Then just general things, end-to-end encryption for 1-1 and a (even) larger video limit"
"Still the best messagging app, still the same old issues. My friends don't always receive the notifications. From the webapp, the user session gets the updated messages flawlessly, from Android and iOS not. This is ridiculous. But it's a nice way to call your friends once in a while, maybe it can be considered a real feature!"
"Recently I saw files disappearing. I downloaded them and they disappear without me configuring anything. I went to the settings and noticed files are programed to delete themselves on channels, and groups after 1 week without even notifying me ? Please put a warning, or send a message at least to those who use your app when you make some changes like that. It is very annoying."
"It's the best app for communication, good for privacy and so easy to use . You can do whatever to sent messages (delete , edit ) Set a timer for sent photos The ability to start secret chat that neither you nor the other side can take screenshots Why 3 stars? Sometimes the servers just don't work and even if i have fast internet it says ""connecting"" Fix it and I'll give it 5 stars ❤️❤️❤️ Edit : it got a lot better, still some issues with the servers but less common"
"The Frontier of instant messaging world for sometime now, in terms of some of the awesoms features it has developed ahead of anyone else, be it group management or media play back or detailed settings menu for granular control of every little things & more, at a huge scale. Telegram is a must try. But all at the compromise of end to end encryption by default. So i consider it as a risky water to sail in for any user, in comparison to alternatives like Signal & Theeema, who does the basics right"
"Each and every update randomly messes up new features. Good app 99% of the time but will randomly stop working, not process messages or images, and sometimes music stops playing for no clear reason while in the app. Happens in the app's own player and outside players. Recently ive been unable to send bulk images, entirely."
"There is some problems after I activate the group topic function. Now I could no longer share any content to the group, instead I must copy the link of the content and paste it manually on the topic. I couldn't schedule posts like previously. I hope the next few updates will eradicate these inconvenience issues. Hope in the future there is a new option to turn this app into something like a forum. Still the best messaging app. I enjoy using it."
"I don't know what happened but my telegram says ""connecting"" even though I have internet. I tried updating it but its still the same. I've decided to uninstall and install it, hope it will work. I will change my rate if it works again. (forgotten) Update: It did work. Uninstalling and reinstalling it again worked. 4stars because photos are not high quality anymore whenever I save it. Is it because there is a premium now?"
"Really versatile, tons of features and interesting stickers, easy to use on PC users. The best part is you don't have to manually backup your chats to switch device unlike a certain other app. Improvement: contact management. Let users select multiple contacts to delete instead of deleting them one-by-one or deleting absolutely all synced contacts. Also please limit chat deletion, it's way too much freedom and can sometimes accidentally delete everything for everyone"
"Almost things are good. There are so many things in this simple application but "" the calls get disconnected before connecting to the person automatically and when I try it again and again, nothing happens"" do something if there is a bug"
"It is amazing app. But why when I updated it the files, photos and any things that had been downloaded deleted.it was so important to me. I hope you solve this problem besides when we save files, they should be in original names."
"This app is great. But I've noticed an issue, I don't know if it's the latest update or not, is that I can't find my downloads, just like before when you hit the search button and it pops up, other thing is you've to go to the settings in order to find your dwloads. I hope you'll fix it ASAP."
Problems with voice messages again. The sound doesn't switch to the ear speaker. I checked it on several Samsung smartphones. The problem appeared after installing the latest updates.
"This app is exceptional but one thing that is bothering me over and over is , my messages get stuck in between and it just keeps sending. I want you to solve this problem as soon as possible, I have tried everything uninstalling and reinstalling the app but how often would someone do that. The app is commendable but it sucks sometimes."
"Eveeything experience is amazing. Only the problem is that sometimes photos are not downloaded immediately, I have to try multiple times then after several trials it gets downloaded. This problem is not only faced by me but also other group memebers. Please fix this bug as soon as possible."
"I love this app. It interacts well with its users, the different bots snd d amount of people that can be in a group, its wonderful. But there's a problem somewhere and that is there need to be something like status or story where we can view our friend's pictures and videos and to express ourselves to our friends & contacts. Pls I like to here your reply on this matter thank u"
"Telegram is a great way to stay connected to friends and family, but also on channels of certain interests. It's easy to use, you can text, send bulk photos and videos, group message, video chats, etc. The only down fall is that opening media files can seriously take a long time - it can be very slow."
"Dears at Telegram team. I've a trouble appeared recently on App with my Android phone, during videos play on some channels if I scroll by shifting or just jumping the time line dot the video to forward or backward it will stop playing and a message will appear informing of a problem and directs to use other playing video app, but even though it will not play because even you can't download it, you have to force stop the App then delete the whole cash Mem, then it's solved for a while then again"
"Would give 5 stars if it worked well with Android Auto. Currently I can't make calls when in the car except via the phone. It's doesn't always go through Android Auto, instead playing on the phone. Can't send or receive messages via Android Auto either."
"Very good app overall. But 4 stars because the app doesn't switch to a Bluetooth headset mid-call (i.e., during a call, the phone connects to the headset but Telegram doesn't, Telegram keeps using the phone speaker). Verified on two different phones so it must be an issue with the app. Other apps, like WhatsApp and Messenger, don't have this issue. Workaround in Telegram is to end the call, close the app and then call again with the Bluetooth headset. This is disruptive to our conversation."
Team amount your upgrades. Could you fix a disappearing element? Whenever we have to crash the app because it is not reproducing video/doenloading we have tonrever to triger any other download to rrgan visibility on the list of files that could be stuck/paused. Please add the download menu option on search all the time. I don't get why is it disappeaa and WHY THE APP DID NOT NOTICE STUCK FILES AS PAUSED ON QUEUE
"I really like the app but I feel it can improve a little bit more. For example, when I make notes on screenshot, I miss choose the color whatever I want instead of choose among few colors. I would like to block people only by the name also!!"
"Excellent communication app!👌👏Recently found that my voice messages are not autodownloaded or difficulty in downloading even when selected for a manual d/l. Sometimes, it is muted in between several times or with low voice or no voice at all😢🤔. Hope this w{uld get set right by a new update! Thank you 🙏🌹"
"Telegram is a very great app for sharing media, for texting and calls but I have been having a problem. The files I download aren't able to play and it is frustrating sometimes. I can't even view them once. I wish you could fix this problem sooner."
"Bug: if you share a video, you can select target contacts/chats and type a message, then it shows the video clipper GUI and the ""send"" button. If you click ""send"", then it shares the video, and throws your message away. Could you fix it?"
This is Step Up from signal the most commonly used encrypted messaging app Telegram offers better security and a variety of better features that are Interactive and self-explanatory you could even say fun stumbling across them in the settings menu I figured out how they work so confident you'll be able to as well. Give it a try! KevG
"I have lower stars bc since this has become an App in the App store, it's been going downhill. I have Lost Many very good channels bc of copywriting issues. Which is bc it's Now a real app that They're Controlling Now. And that's what messed up everything. And I have had this since it was available several Years Ago! But it's still good. I still have some of the good channels so I still get the best First 🤪😊😎"
Honestly My Experience has been fine so far few bugs here & there forcing me to update like all apps. Would recommend this app honestly its pretty good honestly i like it its useful got some pretty interesting stickers and i can send videos longer than 15 seconds. which is better than most apps. when you call there are 4 emojies that should match the person ya on call with to know your call is secure.
"Telegram is superb in terms of chat functions. What is fantastic there is that new members of a group can easily view older messages. And the group members can be unlimited 🤟 It has has different typing functions like Bold, italics, strike through, etc. I just love the functions."
"Some messages are not synced when opening a push notification on a unreliable network (e.g. when on 2G/crowded 3G). You can see them on another client, but even when clearing the cache and forcing stopping the app, the lost messages are never retrieved again."
"I'm having good experience with using Telegram but one thing that really bothers me is when i'm listening to music on telegram and run the app on the background,it suddenly freeze and the music stops playing. I'll really appretiate it if you fix this bug."
"The app is good but if only there was the option to put vocals on hold while recording and then be able to resume same as in WhatsApp. Please consider adding that, it's very useful. Thank you."
"I really like this app, but it doesn't follow the font size settings of my phone. The home panel is still small font as well as many other pages. I can only set the font size in the chat page. If this is corrected one day, i will change my review and give it five stars."
I love the app with one exception. I wish there was a way to have the chat in full screen on my tablet as it is on phone. I don't need to see my contacts (dual pane) when I am having a conversation. I have looked all through the settings and can't find a way to change it.
"I really enjoy using the app and it's my favorite among all the alike ones! but there are some bugs I hope will be fixed, take each time you updated the app all the songs will must be downloaded again, and it doesn't match with any devices like bands!"
"The only thing I want is a camera I can lock to be on. If I need to use both hands for something I cannot use the in app camera. I've also found if you try ""zooming out"" or drag your finger off the screen, it'll cancel the recording and delete it instantly."
"Voice calls simply don't work. Every time the call is a challenge, because of constant disconnecions Edit: Better now, but still prefer another app for voice calls. All the other functionality and UX are great"
"Telegram is becoming better than WhatsApp!!! Even now, it has things that makes the app so perfect. I'd like to see someday Status added to the app and also video calls in groups. On the other hand Telegram's development should fix certains bugs and still working on the app to make it much better"
"1) How could recipient be allowed to delete sender's message for sender as well!? 2) While searching message say 123AB, if I search '123' it won't fetch the message but searching '123AB' will do. 3) Regarding Link preview, change its background colour different from the main message, give a border line (let it be thin) or reduce the font size, to differentiate it from & highlight the main message"
"There are few problems in my account, for instance that I can't listen to music in this app because song being heard can't be paused and moved to the next or previous song when my phone is locked."
"New Review. Giving 4* because Telegram is missing the ability to set both, a call ringer & message tone ringer. Call ringer you can set, but no option to set a ringer for incoming messages. For that reason, only a 4 out of 5..."
"Telegram is a great messenger. But in recent updates it has some problems such as: When I want to download video messages with a short duration (10 seconds or less), it says save to music. So it won't save in my downloads & I can't find it anymore. Another one is before you were able to select some tracks and save them to your music at the same time but now you can't unless you put them together in one place. Can you fix these? Thank you very much ♡"
"Edit: GIFS do NOT play while bubbled on the S23 Ultra. Wow...Just wow! I hear this isn't the safest or most secure messaging app out there, at the same time, I love all of the features. You do not have permission to steal my info and you need ""END TO END ENCRYPTION"". Please get on that!"
"Obviously a great messaging app, you don't need me to convince you about that. There is however one small thing that frustrates the hell out of me: directly replying to a message requires you to swipe from right to left. I've gotten to used to doing the exact opposite from years of WhatsApp, and find it hard to remember. Plus, sometimes the message is so short it can't register the swipe, making it impossible to do."
"Perhaps very good 😊. Everythin is fantastic. Far better than WhatsApp. But just for 2 features, telegram lags behind ... 1) Telegram should provide the feature of Status or Stories which we see on WhatsApp or Instagram. In fact, this is the only reason due to which many have not deleted WhatsApp,even after knowing it's now much safer, until now (including me). 2) Telegram does show the time when one has seen your message. It should show the time when it was seen on the 1st phone. Update these:"
"Notifications don't always work. I regularly open the app to see I've got messages. But I haven't had any notifications to let me know. I've checked Notifications settings in the app, and also in my Android phone. Both are set the way they should be. It's very inconvenient to constantly check the app for message, rather than be be notified."
"This App is worst. Pls don't install anyone. I have an educational content channel. I post the educational content and share it in few other groups. And for doing this, Telegram counts it as a SPAM & BLOCKS your account. This is worst part. I can't text in any groups now. Very bad experience. I won't install the App & nobody should do."
The app is good but give the download option to see all Download videos or else when we are offline and when we download something then only the download option appear . I don't like that so give permanent download option . Other than overall app is good 😊.
"After the recent update the Downloads section can't be seen, can't delete the downloaded larger files like movies which consume more space, it also makes very difficult to download another large movie file as the Storage space decreases as the recently dowloaded couldn't be deleted, Please bring back that Downloads section for the convenient use of the app as soon as possible 🙏"
"When I join a live stream on one of the Telegram channels, the sound doesn't work at all.. I don't hear anything.. I've noticed that this happens with live stream in channels only, but in groups it works normally.. how to fix this problem?"
"I have a suggestion that the way in which a link can be shared on uploading a file in Google Drive and through that link the file can be downloaded directly in the file manager, in the same way this facility should be made available in Telegram Messenger. .. I know a bot also works for all these but not every bot works all the time. This type of update should be taken care of by the team of Telegram Messenger. Thank you."
"Telegram has improved since my last review. The app is awesome for building a community. It has the best privacy features. I prefer Telegram to Whatsapp, however, a lot of people do not stick to the platform. That may change overtime."
I love all of the features it's really powerful but I would like for you guys to make a new feature. A feature where the shared media cannot be downloaded even if shared only to a particular person. Hope that happens
"Love almost everything about the app! What I really want is a way to boost the volume when I'm on a video call. When I use the video call on my speaker phone, I can barely hear the person on the other end so I always have to use headphones."
"This app is really good but I'm having a problem, idk if this is because of my phone or the app, but recently telegram has been stoping a lot when I try to do things, like playing music from one of my old channels / scrolling through it, or going to my settings and clearing my cache. Or doing things a bit fast, like checking my chats. This is so annoying cause I can't do some stuff because of it, and I have to do them slower than i would do. If I don't, then the app will stop and closes itself."
Telegram is my favourite since 2018 because it is secure than Whatsapp but I don't why there is still no group call feature and that's why I use whatapp also for group calling otherwise Telegram is my first priority. Please try to add group video calling feature then I'll uninstall whatsapp because I also not feel safe using whatsapp. Thank you
"I use this app for a long time and i really like it, but now i have a serious problem Last night my account just suddenly log outed. i update it to enter again and that's work but today when i wake up again it log me out. I try to enter again but each time when it refresh to open for the first time some thing like forced stop happend and again its log me out . Idk if the problem is from telegram or my phone but i only have this problem with this app. What should i do?"
"The most stable and underrated app...one star reduced cause i want the developers to please allow the search even by typing phone number, (it doesnt register the no. if typed for search if the contact is saved)(it happens many times that i have forgotten the name by which the contact is saved so i woidl like to search by typing the no.)(this feature works perfectly on whtsp..it shows the chat even if you type the phone number or saved contact name.)"
This app is useful but there are few noticeable bugs. I love the power saving mode in this app. It would be great If more power saving techniques will be used to make it more battery efficient.
"Please improve your desktop version (telegram pc). I have many times 2GB data just for downloading 400-500mb file. File was just about to download and message of ""Download failed"" poped up. It's damm irritating to waste 400-500mb for nothing and that too many times for a single file."
I love to use telegram for daily tasks. i have some suggestion. (please add this option) so we can add a member just for some specific time only and he removed from group automatically. like i add a member in my group for 1 day and after that time period he automatically removed from the group. please add this option it makes much easier to manage group members.. thank you
"it's the best Social Media, Specially if they(Telegram) more care about Iranian users to help them pass through the filtering. A suggestion: It's no need to specify the name of the person who forwarded their message, sometimes it makes problem for them and it' s better just show "" Forwarded"" instead name of whom their message is forwarded."
"Thanks for recent developments. However, there is no way to put All chats somewhere else. Please add this feature. Please develop an ability to pin more chats to the top. This is important as one might have important people to pin (and never miss a message there) as well as important (priority) group chats. With 5 conversations being the maximum it can be difficult to follow up on all important conversations. 20 would be much better. Thanks."
"I've been using this app for 2 years & i got a great experience with this app , i use this app specially for Animes, movies & web series. Although I have 6gb ram , sometimes the app hangs (maybe technical issues) & i daily use this app more than 1.5 hours, sometimes only the app is running on background my phone gets hot. Overall I love this app I'd give it a 8.8/10."
"Telegram is a great texting app & looking for friends/couples, i recommend this app alot. Its a bit addicting tho if your interesting in these kinds of things. But although i give a 4 rating bc maybe its best to put filter&just choices on the age/country that youre looking for."
"Please add a feature where we can group the groups! That would be really helpful and less cluttered and hassle free to find the groups. Thanks, looking forward for this feature."
"Great but after the previous update, audios, videos and photos take long time to download, though my internet is good and I have telegram premium which one of its features is supposedly the fast download speed!"
"The calling screen on the tab s8 plus is forcing me into portrait mode which sucks, and there is a bug where if I open the emojis and click on the text field to send a message and the keyboard is in floating mode, I can't seem to back from the keyboard or close the emoji menu unless I close the app. Wish they were fixed but other than that awesome app, even be worth a premium if it wasn't for those two bugs"
Everything was fine until I was suddenly logged out and couldn't confirm my log in by any means. Phone confirmation is just not working and after asking for code on email it says I have too many attempts to log in even after waiting for 10 hours. And the support team have been silent for 3 days now. UPD: restarting my phone fixed the issue.
I love the app BUT I cannot connect my headphones for audio when I have video calls on my tablet and the audio doesn't always work when calling in general. I hope you can fix the headphones connection ASAP.
"Instagram is a great app. I use it to share my art, and it has helped me turn my passion into a full time career. My only complaint is that the algorithms really deprive people from seeing creative content that they might enjoy. I would also like the ability to turn off the suggested reels permanently. It is really distracting and ruins my experience. I am very selective of the accounts that I follow, and I dont appreciate being bombarded with irrelevant reels."
"Well after taking a year off from Instagram, I reinstalled it. I've been creating video artwork, my posts and reels! And it's gotten better, I have to say. They've upgraded the look and feel of it and made this seamless transition on creating posts and reels. Also the upload quality has went up and it's more reliable! HD videos in these much-needed improvements with added filters and cool extras to make your videos look so good. After about a week of use I have given the experience 4.7👍🏻"
The app is fine. My issue is not finding the user interface easy to understand. Once instructions were searched for (by a third party) the ability to post images become much simpler. Please put information for each button as 'pop ups' with mouse over. When a button is selected allow the app to show what the name of that button is and what functions it performs.
"Works well for the most part. However, in posting, Instagram will often ad black bars to one side of a photo ready to be uploaded even after fixing and cropping. This has been a glitch for months and needs to be addressed asap. If you're posting app doesn't make posted pictures look as they're supposed to, you've got an issue."
"Since 12/18/22, I've been waiting to be able to know where I'm sorting my saves again and it's FINALLY happened! Being able to see where things are save AND FINALLY being able to save reels immediately it a stress reliever. It'd be nice to save to several folders at once, but for now I'm okay with saving individually to several places even if it is tedious"
"Sometimes my different accounts have trouble switching layouts and updating. I had to sign out, uninstall and reinstall in order to have all my accounts completely updated. Kind of irritating. Besides that, works great. Never really had trouble nor recommendations. I just wish all my stuff can update without trouble."
"So far I have enjoyed this app and it's been pretty easy to use. Despite the few times I've had issues with photos or the editing tool working correctly. I don't like that it shows me reels for a person and not their still photos (it seems they aren't showing me all their posts, when I've looked). I have to go to the persons page in order to see everything they have posted, I can't stand the reels about 99% of the time."
"I generally don't have too much issues, but I have a suggestion for Instagram Stories and Highlights. The order of the saved Highlights should be newest to oldest. When I click on an user's highlights, I don't think what they did 55 weeks ago or 438 days ago is relevant anymore. Or at least, there should be an option as to how we want to view or shared saved Highlights. Thanks!"
"Half the time when I'm writing a story on Instagram the text color block gets stuck on black and white rather than the color I had put instead like a blue background for the text. I also miss being able to have the pop-up for when you save a video you can pick which collection to send it to. Now when I save a video, it just gives me the option to save the video, but not to a specific collection."
"Works well but there is one minor bug that needs to get fixed because after long periods of time it does get frustrating. On my Samsung device, I use hiding button navigation. Basically, I am able to turn on button navigation so it stays on either all the time or can turn off for full screen viewing of apps. When I hide that navigation bar, a cut out of that area still remains on the bottom of the screen when I am on Instagram. Please fix this annoying bug."
"It's a good image dump site, and a decent place for art works promotions. The auto refresh is annoying when using multiple apps though as switching between apps causes the refreshing it seems. Also it seems to get confused if you use more than one device for logins causing one to constantly log back in to previous devices."
"My experience with Instagram in the past 2 days have been fine. I'm still adjusting and stuff but yeah I love the fact you can call people on Instagram and go live. And the fact you can save ur lives? Fantastic. I do ask if they can fix the avatars, in my opinion they look a little ""weird "" and there isn't many options to customize, unlike snapchat where the avatars look a little more ""comfortable "" and have more details to customize. So yeah, tbh I would rate it a 3 or 4."
"Instagram is a great app overall! 🌟 The user-friendly interface and engaging content keep me hooked. However, there's a small glitch with profile photos not opening upon clicking. It's a minor inconvenience, but fixing this issue would greatly improve the experience. Other than that, it's a fantastic platform for sharing moments and connecting with friends. Keep up the good work! 👍😊"
"It keeps restricting all the time and asking to log in again and again and resend security code all the time, too much, safe is good but too much interruptions spoil the fun. Just want to share beautiful photos and enjoy sharing beautiful things with the world, should be so challenging, there are enough challenges in life and when we are doing something for fun, it should be fun, it should not become another boring chore. Thank you!"
I have only been using Instagram seriously for about a month and don't consider myself technically savvy but I'm finding it quite user-friendly. I like being able to delete things. I'd like to be able to put a single audio track over a slide show in my story but that's really my only frustration. I'm learning a lot from what I see others doing and from people who specialise in helping other users improve. It's a great community!!
Too much ads lately but I gotta say that's how they make their money. But I love the app. Good connection with friends. But there is also security problems I got hacked twice and couldn't retrieve my original account. New accounts had to be made. There is also too many fake accounts and they keep spamming with messages containing software viruses.
"Okay, I've had this app for a very very long time. Brilliant. However, once I upgraded my phone to a Note20, all the IGTV, Stories and Reels videos are zoomed in. I'm guessing this is to do with the aspect ratio. It's very unpleasant and annoying, since I lose some text or video content when viewing. Instagram, please fix this issue for larger phones. I beg you."
"one feature that i can think of right now is that when we swipe from the home page to post something then the device freezes for a while. also, sometimes when i get a notification on some other account then on all of my accounts, it shows that red dot over the notification button. it would be great if these bugs would be fixed."
"It's really good app, for communication and things like that but I found one issue. I have two accounts (one I'm using always and the second not that much) and when there's new updates they ALWAYS shows and works on the not main account. Example: notes. Everyone has it but I have them just on the second account (not much used one) and not on my main even after updating, deleting a rebooting my phone like I did everything I could and still don't have it. And it's months that it's out :/"
"Recent updates have ruined the most basic function of the app; scrolling. It's irritating, inconvenient and just not smooth at all anymore to scroll through the feed. It tries to lock on to each post now when you flick to the next one but it doesn't even line it up properly sometimes so you're stuck halfway between 2 different posts. Just change it back and stop fixing what isn't broken.."
"I really like this app and use it a lot. But I have always huge problem with chats. It was not happening at the beginning, but last two years it is very common that I literally can't see my sent message, or message with reaction from a friend. I tried to ask on some support or what that was, restart the app, uninstall and install again, log out and log in whay Google said might help, but absolutely didn't work. So if anyone had same problems, may I ask what should I do?"
"It's a nice app, but could you please add the feature to scroll right to the beginning of a chat..or we have to scroll which makes it impossible to reach to the beginning of a chat sometimes. That would be a cool feature and would be beneficial for friends to look back on old memory or simply find something which was useful but it's in the beginning of the chat. Thank you"
"I'm updating my review because of the development of this app, i think it is better than it was before but I'm having an issue with IG messages. I don't get the notifications and messages on real time, they just pop in hours or even days after people dm me. It's been quite probablematic because even though I have an stable internet connection it just keeps happening. I hope you can solve it out soon. Thank you for reading."
"A great app - so far I've been lucky with regards to bugs and errors. The only complaint I have currently is I genuinely HATE how posts are now dated by weeks, and not the actual date itself. I tried looking for a specific older photo and found myself trying to figure out how many weeks there are in a certain time duration, therefore completely wasting time. Please return the dates!!"
"Dear Instagram Support Team, I am writing to report an issue with the ""Leave a Note"" feature on my device. Despite updating the app to its latest version, I am still unable to use this feature. Whenever I try to leave a note, the option of its is not visible I have already tried reinstalling the app, but the issue persists. I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter and provide me with a solution as soon as possible. Sincerely [@aayabadaa.anay]"
"Hi there, suggesting new feature: show saved posts without collections. Difficult to track saved posts not in collections, frustrating to find quickly. As Instagram is used for inspiration and ideas, we saved a lot of posts over time. We often struggled to find saved posts that aren't in any collection. Adding ""without collection"" feature would save time and frustration, make user experience smoother. Im sure many users would appreciate this feature too. Please consider. Thank you for your time"
"It's been good so far. No issues over the years until now. All of the sudden my ""Add to story"" button is gone. Can't repost/reshare anything on my story. I've gone through and updated, restarted my phone, signed in and out of my app. Nothing I do works. Why do I no longer have the share on story button."
"The app is good, but I have a problem with a few things. Number 1, when I try to make a post with few pictures and put a sound it tells it logs me out. Number 2, the Olympic template thing keeps on coming after a few reels, which is annoying. Please fix those."
"I love using Instagram because it's a great app for me to stay connected with friends. However, since the last update made a few weeks ago, I strongly disliked how the Theme feature was removed from settings in the app. I personally used the Dark Theme feature a lot in my phone to prevent the brightness from hurting my eyes and when other friends send a very light sticker or gif image you cannot see due to the background lightness. This feature is useful for everyone and needs to return soon."
"I can't upload a photo with old filters the app used to have and that I used before, that's a thing. Also, I posted a picture with a song and now it doesn't play it anymore. Please help with these and if you could add an option to add music to old posts. That'd be great!"
"I really enjoy using the Instagram app, it's a great way to stay connected with friends and family, as well as discover new content and creators. The interface is user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy to navigate and explore. However, I do think there's room for improvement in terms of algorithmic fairness and user privacy. Overall, I would highly recommend this app to anyone looking for a fun and engaging social media experience."
"It's been a decent experience as an artist on this platform. Their current direction with reels is counter intuitive, but negotiable. Be aware of bots and scammers that will try and mess with you or flood your comments. This place is probably better if you're a photographer or cosplayer, but for being an illustrator it works as a gallery page."
"Issue with opening links sent via sms, WhatsApp or other messaging services. When we open a shared link to a video or content, it goes to the correct content. However, clicking the same link again to rewatch or show someone else on our device, it redirects to other videos and content instead."
"For some reason, no matter how many reels i share with a person he doesn't move up on my share list, even people to whom i haven't texted for years are higher on the list than this person. Also it became harder to search for the said person. Please help me fix this, because this became really troublesome."
Its a good app. Used it since 2018 but got a problem with looking at old posts. Instead of coming up with the date it comes up with how many weeks ago it was. For example I saw a post and it said it was 10 weeks ago which is fairly useless.
"Amazing app! It's really easy to use, and I love watching everyone's creativity! I post my gacha content on here and have 230+ followers! It's a good way to boost my creativity and happiness! Although sometimes the videos I post don't go in full screen and it keeps trimming my videos, so I have to restart and make sure it doesn't trim it. So nothing bad, and anyone can dodge these things!"
"Please put ""Cancel upload"" for uploading stories. Because sometimes Net in Iran is very weak and story cannot be uploaded, so Instagram got stuck in uploading for hours and other options like sending direct messages or reviewing activities & checking notifications or opening pages & posts & other stories doesn't work at all."
"Nice for sharing photos and appreciating other people's wonderful photos ! Good for keeping up with things like entertainment. Has a few niggles but they're minor. 22/09/22 app kept crashing, then reverted back to older version from over 2 years ago? Be nice if video upload quality could be improved for Android and iOS. Videos are badly degraded despite having high quality settings applied. I don't like the adverts on people's profiles, that's well out of order !"
"Instagram is a great app for conversation but their are places where it needs some work to be done, in All Media in chats, all the media isn't shown, receiving messages have delay on phone but works perfectly fine on laptop, there are alot of minor chat bugs. Hope to see all these fixed in the future."
"The app is just so glitchy. There are so many glitches it drives you crazy, it is frustrating and annoying and really ruins the whole user experience of the app. On top of that, instead of fixing glitches and bugs the developers just keep on introducing unnecessary updates, shuffle buttons and layouts which is also annoying and also disorienting."
Super good. My fvrt app tbh love the reaching out and safety options Here are some suggestions that u can add :) 1. Searching in story veiws 2. Archiving whole highlights (with the stories still in them) 3. Stop allowing screen recording in vanish mode 4. Organised likes in stories ( without it scattering into the likes of people who haven't liked. 5. Guide on how to use Instagram for new users with different features shown thats skipable and can be referred to anytime.
Wonderful experience with this amazing app. Couple of things ..Could integrate the Whatsapp and Insta animated avtar... So that we need not need to 2 or more times create avatar. Creating a story with uploading video takes time also we cant find any progress bar while video is uploaded with mbs of data progress being uploads. So please do add this feature in Android mobile app. :)
"I hope one day I wake up and see a real useful update for this app! When you upload a video, there is no way to stop it! No x icon! When a video in post is playing, you can't forward or backward or pause! When you put some #, it's rarely opportunity to go to explore and being seen by users!"
"It's a good app to socialize and a good platform to show our talent etc ,but I wished if you could've extended the story video time to minimum 30 seconds / maximum1 minute. It's very difficult and inconvenient since it's getting trimmed to 15 seconds. So I kindly request you to consider this opinion."
"Hi Instagram, While selection of our audio from the audio library with a particular start point . The application takes more 1 hr to process and sometimes it works good we we exclude our audio start point . Also the GUI of audio that shows only Bars of audio , it would be helpful if it showed something like a waveform ."
This app is really great as it connects the whole world in a platform form . As for me i love this app as it is of sharing all your memorable moments with the people you love. Just the one think i hate about this app is that when you want to upload any long reel longer than 60 secs your video content gets shorter. So hope that team insta would soon find a solution for this. Thank you
"Cool App! Unlike it's predecessor, Facebook. It focuses on streamlined, ease of use rather a bulk of features and markup to deal with. Kudos to the developers for not sacrificing a clean, well designed UI/UX for an overcrowded, overbearing one."
"Instagram is a visually captivating and user-friendly app that fosters creativity, connection, and inspiration. As a musician myself, I find it brilliant for growing my fan base and the experience is simply awesome."
"I have had several videos removed that I had permission to Post and I'm still waiting for them to be restored. I have always followed the appeal process. It would be better if IG alerted you to a copyright conflict to give you a chance to appeal rather than removing the video first, say 5 days or so. They give the other party a few days to review it. So, why can't they? They are not losing a penny because this page is not monetized. No Ads Thanks!"
"A fairly adequate app. that is somewhat reliable, because my first posts where deleted (lost all those followers) because of their excessive requests for personal information. I greatly appreciate privacy. And, now, unable to return to the large numbers of followers/friends that I once had built up, which has been wrongly deleted. ( Expired time to return ) Hopefully, they can fix all their issues with their app and make it more user friendly and accessible."
"Instagram is a grate app for conversation but their are places where it needs some work to be done, in All Media in chats, all the media isn't shown,receiving message have delay on phone but works perfectly fine on laptop, there are alot of minor chat bugs.Hope to see all these fixed in the future."
"It's really sad that ,the music or the audio disappears from Instagram , after being posted.Some of the moment are best shown through music .there are many audio gone from Instagram and some doesn't play. I hope some measure will be taken soon, it's happening again."
"instagram is really great. you can find your friends on there or even do some low-profile stalking. only problem i have is the fact that you can't add text to media that you want to post, except on your story. other than that everything is fine 10/10 recommend"
"I dont have much problems here, except for when I comment or text while the app isnt updated, it kicks me out of the app even when I try to install it and login again. I think it deleted my account when that happened since I cant find it anymore. It booted me out again just a few months ago but luckily it didnt get deleted and got recovered, I hope this bug or glitch gets fixed I dont want to make a new account everytime i comment lol."
I just have a small but frustrating complaint that the online status in Instagram always sucks. It used to show that a person is *online* even when he/she isn't!! Only after five - ten minutes the last seen shows up from nowhere!!! Please fix it if you can!!!
"It's a good app for posting art n talking with friends, my only complaint is the moderation. It would be great if they would add an offline mode where it makes it look like you're offline when you aren't, I think that would be nice."
"For some reason, the reels icon is gone and I can't scroll the reels up and down anymore. Tried clear the cache of the app, log out and log back in, uninstall and reinstall the app to make sure the app is the latest version, the reels icon is now appearing at the bottom but when click it in, no reels showing up, problem still there - cannot scroll up and down. And if I restarted my phon3, the reels icon disappeared again! This is happened on both of my android and iPhone. Please advise."
It's a good app where you can share anything.I think there should be a feature that enable send videos and photos to be posted on your story .What i mean is when someone sends you a video or a photo uou can able to share it through your story as well as post.
It was working nice . But since last update there issues in playing reels. Choosing reel song & when we watch all reels of same songs. After few reels. It's not playing it's being worsen then before. Please update it quick. Specially associated reels with same song
I am facing issues... The story i highlighted in my profile had songs which are not paying while watching story.. and also checked that songs are not removed. Yet it is not playing songs. Now what is meaning to put any story as highlighted....!!!
"One of the things I appreciate most about Instagram is its focus on visual content. The platform is designed to showcase images and videos in a visually engaging way, making it easy to scroll through and discover new content. The Explore page is particularly useful for finding new accounts to follow, as it suggests content based on your interests and past activity."
"Instagram is good , but sometimes the quality of saved stories are very bad.. and most importantly, Instagram need to add a feature of ""back"" in stories because whenever we write some caption in the story, so while adjusting it, we can accidentally delete the text.. and we can't even redo/undo it.. it's very annoying to write something long enough at stories, and it got deleted and there's no way of retrieving it back."
"What's your deal Instagram? I NEVER had problems watching video clips, I was just trying watching them and some of them doesn't want to play. I hit the loading icon on the clip and IT DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY!!!! PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM!!!!! 😡"
"I've had instagram sense 2018 and it's a great social media app, I only rate it 4 stars because I have posted a alot of tiktok videos in the past and even with the newest version of the app I sometimes get notices about the tiktok videos I've posted getting removed or being blocked that I posted a while ago because of the sound I used when the sounds aren't blocked on and are public on the tiktok app I don't understand this and its confusing in less it has to do with current events."
"Well usually I just give everything for stars when I start using it as I am right now and we'll give it a week or two and see how it goes. I'm always just tinkering with new apps and such so I'll give it five stars and even more and beyond if it is useful. Yes useful if I can help mother nature and the world and the people in it and the animals in it..... We have to take action immediately. Somehow someway very good. Good morning everyone, who can read this? It's Monday here in tualatin, Oregon."
"Th ärey have everything. The app and its progress has been a smart idea. The only thing that gets me really annoyed is that they force you to scroll through too many sponsored videos on the home part of the app. It's a completely ok and 4 to implicate but there's a limit to the acceptable amount of it and according to me and many others for that matter, they passed that limit way long ago. Very unnecessary to exaggerate that much in that front. Otherwise good job 👍🏼"
"Im a new user, about 2 months old. P' great all things considered. Got lots of control over my page. 4/5 2 minor grievances. 1st, Would like there not to show the things I've marked ""not interested"" in my interactions. Since I DONOT WANT TO SEE THEM EVER AGAIN. And 2nd would like to have a section where I add the suggested key words, @accounts or #'s I don't want on my feed. It sucks having to do it one at a time, or wait till something pops up so THEN I can eliminate it."
"Its been a few months since I've downloaded insta, and my messaging hasn't updated. It shows that I have the latest version but I do not because it doesn't allow me to change chat background or allow me to reply to specific messages."
"UPDATE: Issue is resolved As a platform, it's good. But the app goes through periods of struggling to load content (except for the ads, conveniently). I've tried updating, uninstalling/redownloading, and refreshing the app, and I have a good connection via wifi and data - no dice. No one I talk to has this problem though."
"Everything is amazing, but I've been thinking about the 'search in message' feature. When you search, it gives results of a certain segment. I would like to go see all of the conversation afterwards the search result. Please think about it,and add an update accordingly."
"Hard to upload multiple photos at full resolution and default settings is to save a copy of every photo uploaded to your phone at a lower image quality than the original. I really don't need to have lower quality photos saved to my phone. I've since figured out how to turn that feature off, but I also don't think that it should be a default setting."
Story is available for only 15 seconds. I am using the Instagram around 1 year and waiting for the story time to expand. Others thing I don't like that earlier I have been experiencing a service where we can easily send liked or saved reels but when I updated my insta this program has disappeared. Also music feature does not work when we edit and save the reel.
"It is an amazing app , and it really benefits me in a lot of things ;however , its algorithms are kind of complicated and not predictable . For example , you may have a certain number of followers , but for unknown reason your posts don't reach out to half of them ."
Updated review There is still some stablity issues with android devices. I tried on note 9 and pixel 6 pro both have same issue. Issue is when scrolling the page jumps randomly and scrolling isn't smooth. Update: this has been fixed Messages weren't working. I cleared cache and still didn't work so I reinstalled app and now I'm on a previous version of ig and can't update :/
"It was a great app... until yesterday. My home feed and reels will not refresh, and all of my texts are gone for no reason at all, along with all my stories. I went to uninstall and the reinstall but now it will not load the login screen. It could be a WiFi issue on my end, but I doubt it because all the rest of my apps are working fine. I am very frustrated and upset at this app at the moment."
"Although my overall experience has been good, I've had an issue authenticating my account. I've had this account, I believe, since 2017. I changed the password to my account. I was asked to submit a selfie video for identification purposes. I have lots of photos on this account and submitted a selfie video on numerous occasions. Instagram emailed me stating that my information could not be confirmed. I don't think this method is working properly. I had to create another IG account."
"Instagram on android is not good. You cannot reply to comments, you cannot see the theme in groupchats, you can only like comments and have no choice between what emoji it uses to like it with, and its harder to operate with. Other then that it is good. I hope Instagram can fix these problems and please update me when Instagram does. Edit: they fixed it 😋"
"This new post's timeline feature sucks (posted # weeks ago instead of month/day/year). The app is also about memories: when and where was the picture posted...but now to figure out what month and year it was 174 weeks ago, people need to calculate. Sucks"
Instagram is very nice app. I enjoyed using Instagram and have seen so many avenues for showcase of business idea and improve small active business and expanding through the programs in this app. It is very much useful nowadays especially with the introduction of online business idea systems approaches. I really enjoyed because I find it easy for live post and text edits posts except the reels. I am still learning how to use the reels to post any updates on the business page review on instagram.
The app is great but there are some bugs i think. Whenever you sort your followers list it doesnt change. Ot always says that its been updated but you cant see any changes. Please fix this i need to see those i followed in order.
"This is a secondary profile. Why? Because a close friend and I found ourselves unable to find a shred of our friendship. If I click their link, it shows default cutout for photo and reads ""user not found"" the link will show upin the DMs, but it leads to a ghost. I have to go looking for post they might be posted in. We can't find anything the is tagged in. I've tried contacting and reporting this problem, two years later, well I'm on a new device, new profile afraid to add one another."
"My experience was very good except for a few things, for example, in my personal account I couldn't react or answer messages through the chat, and in my other account it wouldn't let me advertise my products except for that. I really liked this app."
"the shared link to instagram reels is not working. the first time anyone presses the link, it brings them to their instagram reels page, but not to the intended shared reel. only at the second press does the link actually work. please fix this bug, it has been here for a while"
"Everything is pretty good except for the fact that i cannot access reels, it is very irritating when my friends sent me reels they like but i cant send them any because i dont have a reels tab on the bottom of the screen like they do..."
"It's a very colourful and we'll set out and easy to use Social Platform!! Just be Wary, as in Google Chat there are a lot of A.I driven profiles! Be vary wary of buying Steam Cards, Vanilla, Game cards Etc. If asked?...Run for the Hills! There won't be physical meetings or Hook-ups...!! No matter how sincere!! But an enjoyable App!! Also definetly not for under 18""s...catman😺"
"Everything about this is great, but after the recent update, I'm not able to see when people were last active, even though they haven't changed the privacy setting. Kindly look into it."
I just updated the app and everything works fine but when I am watching reels it stops halfway through the video.... This just started after I updated it a few hours ago... Hope you can fix this issue
"I like the approach for posting. Finding out how to do other functions is a bit difficult and takes time. Guess it's the learning curve. However, once you save some tunes and decent clips, you move onwards and upwards!!"
"Its a very good social media platform and every body well known about this and but some times there are bugs and lagging and so on. And Now I trying to create an account but after everything thing is says there is a valadation problem and then say network problem and so on. l iterally tried because and did it again and again but it not creating an account and so,I came here and writing an message or feedback to you and I not saying that Instagram is bad or it have many bugs or something.Thank u"
This app is very good and has many features But the flaw i feel is that some privacy options in chats and online system is very dull it dosent work propely. Moreover there are not precise options for every thing. Like there should be when to show online status and exact time Beside these there are certain other things needed to be fixed
It's good and helps alot in the medium of entertainment but it's quite addictive and after the new update the drafts I'm saving are nowhere to be found whenever I try to post something from my drafts I just couldn't get the drafts option so I stopped saving drafts... Thank you and have a nice a everyone 💟
"Well, the experience is quite fine, the only big problem I have so far is that I can't reply to any messages in Direct chats. I've heard this problem happen to a couple others as well. Reinstalling the app doesn't help."
"I suggest to set a limit to the amount of reels available for show online, this suggestion is regarding healthy screentime among teenagers like me. a time limit to both upload and watch the reels online at certain time of the day, so as to not do injustice to content creators. I doubt this suggestion can go through at a platform like this one but it's worth a shot.."
It is a good app but there are some bugs which Instagram have to fix 1. Some persons do not get the option of reply to particular message 2. Some times we are not able to see the dp by zooming
"Great app, but there is. Problem, when i post video to stories and feed, the audio quality is bad and messed up. I post video of myself playing drum and the sound is awful. Please fix this. I know this is probably because of conpression. Please let me post video with same quality. Thank you"
"I'm a recent (summer 2022) newcomer to Instagram, but the app can be a bit overwhelming at times. There's a number of features and quirks that you don't understand until you experiment or read more about it online, which is kind of annoying. Wish there was a way to hide some of the stuff I don't use. But anyway, it's a nice way to see updates from friends and does have some cool features. Not my favorite social network, but I'll keep it around."
"I love this app and use it every day but I've been having glitches every now and then for example something saying ""posted 1 second ago"" when it's obvious that's not the real time it was posted and this has been happening all week. If you can fix this please do, thank you!"
"It is a good app,but it is missing some features that are found on other phones,it gets frustrating,for example the theme and vanish options they are just not there completely,but overall it is a good app.And also it denies me the ability to reply to other chats"
"For the most part it's good. BUT recently went to an older video I had and tell me why like 6 of my older videos have NO sound. There was no songs, so it's nothing to do with policy. Just my little one and I talking. Not sure what the issue is. But come on fix the issue."
"Note:please add delete option in mutiple picture and option for adding music after posting photos,also feature for downloading story with music ☝️☝️☝️☝️ could you make it possible in next updation ,you guys just make updation that are not beneficial,just do something useful for your supporters, these all features are available at one time and not now, please get back those"
"My request to the developers is to add the following features ASAP; 1. Search a user by Name or ID. 2. Filter all users by level. 3. In my Profile, filter the user that I am following by Country, Level, Live or Online. 4. A favourites users option The app will be more Interesting with these features."
It's interesting and the people are fun also gives you away to earn free coins by doing task inside the game the only thing they should have more choices on the top up side
If your looking for a rapid find and chat this this definitely would be in top 5 to choose from
For the last few days I am not able to reload diomonds and this application is getting worse after every update
Very fantastic but the recent update version is very bad.. Where is the task option plzz fixed it THANKS
Why is the application having so many glitches Daily task button is not showing for me plz fix the problem there is no customer care support also whom should we ask
"Stop taking away options to get free gold cards, it just makes the app like every other app and it's very annoying"
This app is very helpful 👌 I earned a lot of money here in this app but now I can't use my account because I changed my cellphone number because I lost my Sim card now can't open my account 😭
Please enable camera switch So we can use back camera while calling too
App is really beautiful but need so many free calls. Please make it so that free cards are available and free coins are available 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
"Chamet: add a feature for higher level users to recharge a friend's account or to transfer diamonds to share. End lucky packets. Add a feature for user to purchase any car they want. Only for lvl 8 and up. Add a feature where you pay 10k for a popular type gift. When the user opens the gift, the CPU will determine what they get, as long as it's 10k value. Add a rule where guest can't turn off their camera for first 10 minutes in party Add Paypal or other supported payments for Americans"
"Few months ago, i have signed in with my Google account and with my phone also, so at that time after signing in, i earned diamonds by watching free asvertises, but after some time i was not getting ads to earn free diamonds, so that's why, i have logged out of my both the accounts and i have uninstalled this chamet app, but after installing the chamet app yesterday and after signing in with my google account, i am not getting advertises, so please fix this issue."
"Payment method needs more easier like Paytm, Google pay etc for purchase of diamond"
"Very Good one , But only problem I can't connect with customer care number, when ever ask questions, only ready-made answer coming there, not as my question, It's better to give us customer care number which we have solve our problems Otherwise this app is very nice"
It's a sexy and good app to talk with girls. They are real but it's too really expensive can't u give a free cards to talk with girls
No return in Lucky i loss almost 2 lakh daimond very bad experience don't download this app
I dont understand why i cant receive any call ...it notify me that i spend 1 min alot of time chatting...how is that suppose to happen which is I really dont.pls make it clear 🤨
Enjoying but coins value is very costly
I made a withdrawal since 20th of April till now I have not received the money in account or reverse it to my metwallet please do something about it and this should make available for customer service section where one can communicate with The agent and resolve there problem not coming to review section to table our issues
"Interesting App, have been lately using the app quite a while, I love the thought of levelling up with recharge and not sending that's something new. Something more interesting would be if the gifts had animations, we would not mind paying more if we can see that wow expressions on hosts. Few bugs to be fixed and this is normal in all apps. Overall you guys have done a good job. 👌"
Very good app. Except that the rate disparity gap is very vast. Yes level system is there which is very helpful to find out the person's rating. However when the call rate difference is so vast it doesn't hold any ground or rather not fair...I hope this issue can be resolved soon. Thanks
"I am facing a problem from few days, whenever i open the app the profile pics of other users asa well as mine is not getting displayed. Also in the region section the country flags are also not getting displayed. Any type of picture is not getting displayed. The images og the gifts are also not getting displayed. Apart from this there is another problem. When i try to see my earnings the page loads for a long time and again, displays nothing. I reinstalled but the problem still persists. Help!!"
I am using it from long time but now when i am log in it logged me out again in a two seconds I don't know whats wrong
Nice app easy to connect the other
Everything is good with the app exept that in video call i can't use the bluetooth earphone and that thing only annoys me please figure out to solve it
Kindly add dark mode feature.!
Nice and very perfect software i like it
This app updated version not working
Super app very fantastic entertainment app i am so happy😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
"HELP ME PLEASE I WAS BANNED AGAIN FROM THE APP, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG, PLEASE FIX THIS PLEASE 🥺"
Chamet app has been great so far. I like the app. But i would like to recommend the developers to add a notification feature that we can turn on for our favourite girls. So once they come online then we will be notified. Just my suggestion. Once that is implemented the app will be a perfect 5/5 for me. Other then that i enjoy using this app and keep up the good job
"It's good but need to improve get ticket in 12hours , improve near by account it's not working actually"
This app is very good but i didn't get recharge and my amount get deducted from bank
Full on time pass app and worth downloading.Just awesome I love this app ..but if you give free cards on every purchase that will be much better because I have purchase lots of time the same amount but when we purchase the amount the offer of free card is finished ok if you can't give free card keep some gifts for the purchaser who purchase everytime this will make us little more happy to keep on purchasing the diamonds. This Thank u
"first the app is okay no problem at all. it easy to use but please enhanced your application. kindly add "" CHANGE GENDER"" and add the ""DELETE ACCOUNT"" in settings section. to those person who made or fill up wrong (typo error instead). PLEASE DO FAST ACTION FOR THIS ISSUE. HOPE TO IMPROVED YOUR APPLICATION. HOPING FOR YOUR SOONEST RESPONSE."
Just little too expensive but good app
it's a good option for hot and spicy chat... 😄
"Hi Team, I am sorry to say this I am completely unhappy after I update this app to latest version 3.0.6 but it was good in before the latest update . 1. Once anyone send mages I get notification, but i am not able to open their messages as I couldn't see any messages from individuals.  2. Even if I messaged anyone, I couldn't see that messages and list of past messengers once I open chamet app again. You can find with subject of email also : I am not seeing messages on chamet"
If you reduce cost of diamonds as like in the past version and if you give more diamonds this will be the better to each and everyone. The previous version is completely awesome but now it is not good. If you change the app like what I had mentioned in the first this app will be unbeatable and unstoppable...
Put some DELETE OPTION on messages or any chat platform please.
when I open my other account chamet send otp .but I set password chamet font show me to put password please fixed this problem because my s card is not online every time
Starting to very like😅 and also it's so fun here👍
"Good app better experience. But too expensive and if u connect call and 1sec also starts u lose u r coins that's not good, the app is only thinking of the hosting not of the viewers, who can make this app more famous if they will always like to be in this app enjoying. And the coins also need to be less for 1min which is 2000diamnds if its 500 also its fine. My suggestion will be for guys that just dont waste your money on this app. It's quite expensive. App management need to think of it.thnks"
Worst experience. Recharge didn't happen but money got deducted. Don't waste your money. No proper support provided too. Update : 3 payments were successful out of 4. App is good but I felt that it's a bit too costly. Changed rating to 4.
"Please do dear chamet team random match free..its good for your app .. If you want, then match option remains so if no one likes call cutting So many people will do it, it will take time, but there is no problem, whatever the users have to do, they will also wait for the random match ... .... give random match option again please .... Or else tell me why not"
"Hi All, A lot of Apps are in playstore like this and I almost tried each one of them, but I must say this chamet app is most user friendly , with real people negligible fake profile like other apps , social app and nice place to have a time pass and even earning. User friendly interface , games and content make this app worth using. and Go and one must try this app if anyone wants some fun along with some earn. Thumbs up chamet! Try to add more tips games😜"
"This app is good. I just hope that you improve the system to decrease the data usage coz it's causing the phone to lag. And also, please restrict screenshot during private calls."
please increase 2 min but awesome
"Sim outgoing and incoming are closed, only watsapp service is available, now i open app but they sent a OTP and i didn't get, but should i do, can i get OTP on same watsapp number"

Excellent How to use point ...and convert coin
I love this app.. It's awesome. But it is not working from last 3 or 4 days... . This app is not responding. It is getting stopped after clicking on it's app icon.. I request to fix this as soon as possible..
I really love this chatting app because it's different from other chatting apps as It has unique features.you can connect with the people from all over the world from this app and make them your friends.very nice app it is the only app sufficient to fulfill all the emptiness of life. Thumbs up to the developers.
"This app is superb but it's premium facility should be one month, 3 month or year. It's Card are very expensive that a person can't afford it. Please collapse this cards system, otherwise overall this app is good."
Application is really good to communicate with someone......🤝 But you can make it more stable by adding the dark mode or night mode.which can easy and good to use it at night...
"Kindly resolve my issue. I made a recharge on 28-01-2021 but unable to use it becoz of suspended account. Emailed developer but no response. Plz kindly resolve the issue. UPDATION: Tried everything nobody is responding Nor the developer of app nor google. I made a topup recharge on 28-01-2021, coins credited but unable to use because of suspended account. Mailed the developer but no response till date"
"Fine app, there's no many ads, can talk to people real time. Only concern pls have a setting which we can set the background to dark mode.... Its so painful to eye when using it in the dark.. thanks"
"I give 4 stars, cuz the people you meet here are real, and this app is easy to use. A small issue there is about the rate of diamonds you buy everytime your recharge ends, they are a bit expensive. Overall good app, i must say."
"App is great safe and secure but there is one issue, that when we click on random call it takes too much time to connect. I think this should be improve.Thank you......."
Chamet is very nice and helpful app. You can meet and enjoy talking to different people. But please fix the arripay. I can't recieve code. Also my 4 hostess always failed to log in and they can't recieve verification code. They cannot withdraw of their salary. That is annoying😡
I enjoy this app.. it's like having a real interaction with different people around the world.. .. meeting and having friends.. The only problem in this app is when recieving a call.. always connecting.. 😊😊
The version 2.00 is not good not able to find people we follow in Live section We need to scroll down alot to find them. Request you to bring previous version back or add the same feature back.
"I installed this app .this is very good social networking And talking stranger ...I enjoyed trying this app but when I used to run this app, I used to get some time for 30 seconds but now I am not getting any free calls in the new update."
"It's a nice app but difficult for Nigerians to withdraw since Epay was removed as a means of withdrawal, can you please add Epay back since, NGN has been added back to Epay, so Nigeria hostess can work more effective and withdraw there money with ease. Thanks."
"The application is nice, but there are women who are naked in their application but it's nice that the broadcast section is free. but the 6 level limit is higher in the broadcast section."
"Excuse me Iam not able to install the app. I have enough space in my device, still its not getting installed. It finishes the download 100 percent by to after that it shows, it can't install."
"It's a good app , at the same time they would have given the last seen of the user in their account ... There is no last seen shown in this app that's a huge drawback ."
"Really nice app, but when I logged out or stay away for long time after coming back at that time camera is not working properly tried different phones as well but issue remains the same, I think developers should reconsider this"
There's is no caller and still always connecting and the caller cancelled there calls .. If the caller cancelled there call less than one minute it will be banned ..how to collect or to earn the host if each caller cancelled the call ..the is wasting the time and effort.. So I suggest all caller cancelled there call it will be banned Thank you ❤️
"Cool application...but dimonds are quite expensive,it will be so helpful if you can reduce the amount for purchasing the dimonds.. because it's too hard to purchase in the amount always....it will take some time to get used to the games in chamet ...so that we will definitely loose all the dimonds in the beginning so it will be so helpful if you can reduce the amount or get us some offers once a week.... which we can purchase dimonds in small amounts so ...and another advantage is friendship 💜"
"Atleast this app gives unlimited massaging facility. So, thats why i love this app. But one thing that the call is so expensive if it would some less then this app is the best app ever."
That's good app.. Real friends I meet in this app.. Just a single suggestion I have.. Pls verify the payment gateway.. Some times debit and credit card not working.. Pls ensure and make it clear..
"Good app but cost too much, lots of fake profile"
Experience is good but app is costly. You can always lower down tha value for coins or decrease call rates to 1000/ min.
i gave for stars because they do not rrply to those emails i have sent to them . but this is legit paying app . i have already withdrawn my earnings 3 times and its directly to my account in just a seconds.
This was the best app before update after update Random match is taking a lot of time I think it's a technical issue please check it and on invite a friend we get only 1 card that's not fare so please solve it 🙏🙏
It's a good app....but recently i got to know that new accounts being made donot have lucky wheel or lucky box game. Please don't remove those games as me & several other players like me are the ones who only play those games.
I want to login via Facebook but in app not showing any option
"There is no option to send .MP4/.avi ie. any video format, other than that it's a good application"
nice app i really do enjoy
that's nice experience for me making some new friend
"Every features was good, quality good but little expensive.. Please reduce your charges if possible otherwise GOOD APP.."
Hey Chamet developers...I love this app but as said I'm not able to get any video call cards even after inviting so many of my friends Please look into it and I hope for the best :)
"Great joyful app but need to add a coda payment method or a paytm method Bcoz more than 4 times recharge in a month via google , google not allowing & in a month 15 days app I can't use bcoz of via google VI payment. Need to add other payment methods."
nice app but sometime boring
Wonderful app to meet hot girls
app is the for my single friends thank you
You should give search option in this app
very nice app I like it
"I have points and diamonds but when I check my earnings,I see $0"
oh it's cool and nice
this very nice app
Very useful app
Very good this app
"It's fun to learn languages, and keeps you motivated to keep coming back. It feels very well thought out, I like the idea of needing to practice to gain more lives. There's only one fault I can find. The amount of ads can feel a bit overboard. I understand needing ads, it's a free program, you need some way to make money. But getting an ad every single time you finish a section is a bit much. Especially if you can speed through it in a minute"
"The app is amazing for me, as I am a beginner in language learning. I am currently doing 2 languages (German and Spanish), and my personal experiences have been great with it. The only problems I have with the app are technical issues. They are not too bad, as the animations for when you get the question wrong or right just pop up. I have just started to notice this happening. The pictures of the people on the streak ""slides"" haven’t been showing up, but the speech bubbles are."
"Very useful and game-centric approach to language. Easy to make it a routine and the tournament events with timed lessons help reinforce recall speed. My only real complaint is trying to pick up the Grammer as I go. It ends up being trial end error without any real explanations. There's a several examples provided for each unit, but sometimes it seems like it's missing something. So, I end up spending some time in the archived forums hoping someone asked the same question already."
This app is great but has many flaws. I like the new update to make it like a journey. I just wished there were less steps in each section. I like the addition of the grammer tips for each section. I wish for beginners they included a lesson for the alphabet at the beginning. I feel like I have no clue how French sounds work and it's annoying when I can't get the speaking lessons right. More lessons with stories would be nice. I like the conversational aspect so I can put sentences in context.
"I'm in the paid, Super-Duolingo experience. Overall, this is working for me. I am still taking lessons. I hate the gamification, and that I am a sucker for it. The behavior of XP score totals is variable and eratic. There is a bug in my Android version with the speaking lessons. If I press the ""speak"" button too soon, it will not process speech and I fail the drill. Workaround: after the first fail, replay the prompt and wait 3 seconds after it finishes."
"I recently found that the iPhone app allows dragging words. On Android, I have to tap a lot of words to remove them one by one and then add them back if I made a mistake in the beginning. Also, the timer pauses in between questions during the ramp up challenge, but it resets to 0 when the app is put to the background. Make sure you restore the remaining time, when the activity restores."
"Very good. Teaches well and is fun. Although, I do have some issues. They don't teach pitch accent (I'm learning Japanese and this is really important), and I thought (not in a rude way) that the app was for learning a language. And sometimes some things aren't explained at all or very well. Some of this may be my fault. So overall I would say this app is perfect for studying a language, but for learning you would still need other tools as well."
"Excellent tool for developing an ear for the sounds and patterns of a language; it starts simple with a gradual evolution to more complex sentences. The compact lessons make it easy to develop language study as a habit. Not every language has systematic lessons in grammar, so you might want to supplement your language study with additional research or tools. I've been using it to study 3 languages for 4 years with a paid subscription. It is cost effective and continues to challenge me."
"Has most of the language learning features I could imagine wanting and is a good deal either with subscription or for free. Some platforms have way more features than others, though. This costs a star because they have a number of gameified competitive elements to structure your habits, and the competition is easier or way harder depending on your platform. I think if I had realized the game was thusly rigged to start, I would not be mad. The gameified elements do help my practice not stagnate."
"It's a great learning tool for languages. It gets you in the habit of practicing your chosen language everyday, and it does cover listening, speaking, writing, and reading. However, specifically for learning Japanese, the progression for learning grammar points is painfully slow. They could pick up the pace there more."
"Really great to be able to learn a language for free, but I wish some of the course was structured a little differently. For example, instead of treating different conjugations of the same word as different words (eg. hablo, hablas, habla español), it would be great if sometimes the lesson was more abstract - ie how to conjugate -ar verbs (-o, -as, -a, etc) and then apply them to specific verbs (hablar, amar, etc). It might get annoying with more complex tenses in the future. We'll see!"
"I've been using the app for 5 months now and I think this is a very good language learning app. Especially considering it's FREE. I must say I do NOT like the latest update. With the legendary option, you could go back and test your knowledge of EACH individual lesson. Now they've grouped lessons into sections and you can only do a test for a complete section which includes about 15 individual lessons. Why?! Please change it back. But overall, I would recommend."
"For the most part I like this app. It has a lot of good things about it that helps teach with memorization and learning. My biggest problem with it is that it's pronounciations are conflicting. Sometimes it's said one way and then another way in a different lesson. Also certain ways sentences are set up aren't explained, you have to guess until it's correct. So it needs work but overall it's a good app."
It is fun to use and keeps me interested in learning French. A few too many email reminders and no actual direction on how to use all the features are my reasons for not giving 5 stars. You just have to wing it to learn what to do. I like the short games so I can do as many as I want in the time I have available. Review update... I'm not fond of the changes they made months ago directing your path. I enjoyed picking the lessons and going back to review when I wanted a refresher or read a story.
"Great app, not a replacement for a full course. Doesn't teach grammar very well, you just kinda have to pick up on it. Software is solid, but I've noticed some problems. I'm taking the Japanese course, and the app frequently throws kanji at me it's never shown me before and expects me to know it. And won't let me move on. Luckily, I can just use another app to look it up, but I shouldn't have to rely on outside sources just to use Duolingo."
"This is a good app overall and frequent changes. One thing I'm still not sold on is the stories. I like them, but their placement in the overall like of the course is weird, as they're often in places that don't make since with the vocabulary they use vs the vocabulary that's been learned. Also recently something has changed where the volume varies dramatically within each lesson."
"I really enjoy the lessons and they work well, but the gamification is a bit much for me. For example, my routine on weekends doesn't include DuoLingo, which the app treats as a crisis (Oh no, my streak! No, I don't want to buy a freeze!) every time. I also don't need to be interrupted to be congratulated when a lesson is going well, nor open fifty chests or track my four different currencies or whatever each time I finish a lesson. I get that this helps many, but I just want the lessons."
I had given Duo five stars but I had to take one (at LEAST) away because of the new format. It is a HUGE MISTAKE and a giant leap backwards from the original layout. If it was just a matter of appearance I wouldn't care but it makes learning SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. Instead of doing one lesson from a few different topics and reinforcing those lessons with practice you have to complete a whole unit of a small amount of repetitious new material and then you lose track of other stuff.
"Overall duolingo is a fun way to get used to a language. I wouldn't use it as the only way to learn a language but the gamifying keeps me going with it and over the years I've definitely seen imrovement. I appreciate that the app does not stand still but tries to improve as well, though sometimes this process can be frustrating when they chance what we are used to and like about the app. Overall good app."
"Please improve the screen real estate on Mandarin. I am currently zooming in and out to see the writing. Please check feedback in all comments that have been turned off. Also review the errors from the feedback button on the questions. I'm on the final purple level. It is getting monotonous, and wish that it could vary to keep it interesting. Please add stories or something on the legendary level."
To be honest a very good app 1. Makes it easy and doesn't make it jump ahead and gives you time to understand it 2. Makes learning fun 3. Helps learn languages in a fun and happy away. Cons 1. Some things you don't learn which can confuse you 2. Too many expensive things. for example hearts. You should be free to make mistakes without having to use money or currency.
Very useful for learning another language however I've found I've made most my mistakes when I can't understand what certain characters are saying....it be nice if there was button option to swap voice when it's hard to hear them correctly. I've also had times I couldn't do the speaking ones and on hitting buttonto skip it would pop up next one as already being incorrect and I wouldn't get perfect score.
"There is a few ads which isnt too aggravating cuz you earn gems from watching them, and every now and then ill earn the xp but when i look at the leaderboard again it will not have as much as what i had before, but I am very competitive so that could be a big part of it. And other than that duolingo Is very helpful and teaches language lessons in a easy and very fun way, I have recommended it to several family and friends and they now use it also, and love it!😊"
"Overall this is a great app, and its very easy to use along with being fun. However it does have its caveats, as every good app does. First off, after a while (and by a while I mean 2 -going on three- years worth of learning) your streak can feel more like a burden than just a 'here's how long you've been keeping your streak' Secondly, getting gems is a grueling job. 4/5."
"This is overall a fine app, but it constantly bombards you with notifications and emails, and there is no way to choose only the ones that you actually need. Otherwise, it's fine and a good way to start learning a language or to use to fresh up on or while taking a class of that language, but it's not really good for being the sole teacher alone, it teaches the words but it's not very good at showing you how to use them."
"I've been doing Duolingo for Czech daily for a few months now since moving to Prague. It's certainly better than nothing, but it's quite frustrating that they focus on things like certain animals (Bears?!) first before basic numbers, telling time, directions, days of the week, colors, food beyond apples/pears, etc. I would appreciate encountering vocabulary sooner that would be much more helpful day-to-day. I also miss the feature to skip lesson groups (circles) instead of only entire units."
"Generally enjoyable way to learn Italian. The competitive nature of the Super Duolingo program is a little disconcerting because I want to be more leisurely in my learning, which is just for fun without a deadline ahead. I understand that you are trying to motivate me to finish the course but I sometimes find it annoying to receive word that I have dropped out of the top ten and similar messages. I am also unsure where to go now after finishing the lessons, trying to do ""legendary"" challenges."
"The app is great and a good way to keep yourself learning a language every day. However, I have a bug from the Japanese lessons that has been annoying to deal with: The pronunciation option is really buggy. Sometimes I turn it off, but if i come back to the app later it might start showing pronunciation again even though it's off, and I have to turn it on and off again. Sometimes the romanized pronunciation shows when I have the Japanese selected. I hope these issues can be addressed. Great app"
"It's over all great so far. Having no problems with the technical side of the app. It runs great and hasn't crashed once in the 8 days I've used it. However there's a few problems with learning. I'm doing the Spanish course and many times when it reads out a sentence the words aren't all audible. When reading it out words like de, un, una and other small ones are drowned out. The only way to catch them is using the button to slow it down. It also doesn't teach grammar very well."
"Some things I really enjoy about this app, the fact that it's free (with limited features, but still!), and I do think the learning style has good research behind it. The competitiveness helps me, as you compete with other learners. The things that bother me are that there are very few grammatical explanations (I'm leaning Chinese), and sometimes there are misspellings, or seemingly confusing teaching (two pronunciations for the same word with no explanation)."
"I like the app a lot. I'm not confident I'm learning Spanish, because this app is mostly rote memorization of grammar rules and sentence structures - when it requires me to speak, it doesn't really care if I say words correctly; just that my tone and rhythm are correct. I can say the words almost however I want as long as they sound close. I would need more immersion with Spanish speakers to know if it was working."
"I loved how Duolingo worked before this most recent update (layout, points system, etc.). The previous layout made it easier to see/control what lessons I accomplished and which ones I needed to practice. This one is just a mess with the excessive scrolling. It's so easy it is to drop a league now. Goals helped before, but I'm not motivated by the achievements anymore, because of the changes. I'm motivated by my own pace/ progress, not competition. I might ditch it after my 365 streak this month"
"I am using it to learn German and French, as well as revisit my school days Spanish. It's solid as far as the teaching aspect goes, albeit a little repetitive; and unless you go looking for it, doesn't offer too much on the way of grammatical explanation, until you get something wrong several times. But I enjoy using it and I am certainly learning a fair bit of those languages."
"I use this app in combination with speaking to my girlfriend who is a fluent Spanish speaker, and I think that the results have been great! I have learned a lot of vocabulary and grammar and I have been able to tune the general grammar from the program to more colloquial usage through in-person practice. My only reservation is that I can no longer practice any section I want. The format changed to a single learing path, which makes it difficult to pick and choose the most useful lessons."
"I have used Duolingo in the past and liked it very much. The repetition really helps. I look at the guide books before I start a unit. I do think that you need to beef these up in some way as some of my learning is trial and error. When I make a mistake a tip pops up. I wish there was a way to save that information for review later. If you are under a time crunch, it is hard to stop and write that information down when the mistake occurs. I have purchased some textbooks and dictionaries."
"Great education tool for leisure learning. The game format makes it fun while teaching. Having a good background in studying the language, I am aware that there are alternative ways to say the same sentence, and Duolingo sometimes does not allow for that flexibility, but that has been my only frustration in using this app. Don't get hung up on the seemingly silly and useless phrases and sentences Duolingo uses in many of the lessons. It is all about learning vocabulary and verbs properly."
"I love this app. I had to get the super plan because I make a lot of mistakes and the target practice is essential for a slow learner such as myself. The quests and social features give me more motivation to practice without penalizing me if I can't fulfill all of the quests. I do wish that the subscriptions were cheaper or at the very least had more monthly payment options, especially for the family plan. For check-to-check people it can be difficult to pay an annual payment vs a monthly."
"I really like duolingo, it teaches language well, but because of the different ways people learn I think there needs to be more accessibility to feedback when a particular course is just too difficult or complicated. In a globally recognized difficult-to-learn language the lessons are top notch and you can breeze right through it. In a globally recognized easier-to-learn language the lessons are complicated and you don't make it through the lesson half the time. Finding myself losing interest."
"Great foreign language app, especially for free. The ads aren't overwhelming like in many of the game apps. I've been doing it for maybe 3 years now, just a little bit every night and I feel like I'm learning something useful. Ive tried their biggest competitor and found it to be more business traveler oriented. I'm looking for a casual, conversational format with some grammar and this is it."
"Duolingo really needs a patch update, as it occasionally freezes when I least expect it. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get it to work, and it works again for a while... until the next time it freezes! At least it worked consistently from January to March 2023, and it was actually a pretty good experience while it worked. Although I would give this app 5 stars, I'm giving it 4 stars until it's fixed."
"Fun and easy to use, with many languages to choose from. The spelling it wants can be pretty specific, pretty quickly, when it's still kinda difficult to remember how, and your phone doesn't know how either. And I'm a bit disappointed to see the branching system suddenly gone, I thought it was nice to have a couple lesson options, instead of a straight line (my partner agrees also), with the option, I guess to jump way head. But I've done 3yrs of HS French sooo.. maybe a nice option too, lol"
"Edit 5.4.23: Extensive gratitude is giving for this app! It's helped out so much. Just wish offline mode was still available properly. Overall Duolingo has helped me significantly on my road to learning another language. However, since the recent update, the offline feature is no longer valid. I live in a metropolitan area where a majority of my time was spent underground whilst being able to use this app. Please bring back the offline feature! Thanks :)"
"The new update needs fixing. Training missions for hearts after failure don't focus on what you just failed. Which is what I'd like to do if I had failed an exercise. Good points, the monthly badge requirement has been balanced out, and the Match Madness Mode IS SO MUCH FUN! ♥️ Thanks for the improvements! I'm honestly hooked again. I wish we could stock 2x point modifiers like the freeze streak ones. But a better phone made it all work."
"Using this to learn Japanese. I'm a little disappointed that I have to learn the alphabet before anything else (it's big). The ads suck, but they're only 5 seconds each. What's worse is how much they push premium. ""Want to watch an ad for x?"" ""Get premium for unlimited access to x!"" I just want to learn! This app works, but it's a hassle. Much better when I was learning Spanish a few years ago."
"The free version is nearly instantly frustrating. I am now on the 2-week trial version of Super Duolingo and loving it. There are still some aggravating moments, like when certain sentences are given without a translation. But it is engaging, fun, smart, and is definitely teaching me the new language."
"This isn't the ultimate language-learning app, but it's a good one. I've only used the free version, but it was adequate. It's best used if you're already somewhat familiar with the language--you can review and build vocab. (It's helped my Russian and Spanish, and I can't wait for them to develop a Cantonese-from-English course!) The lessons are fun and well developed. I do wish there was more scalability in difficulty, and some tips sections could outline grammar more, but overall, it's great."
Great app. If you have an old mid range phone the motions and slickness will not work as well. The only reason why this does not get 5 stars is because the app will change the words and waste your hearts. For example: Spanish in French would be elpangole and some times it will change it to espangl and say the second one is correct. Ugh
"Most of the time I don't usually have time with my busy schedule, but it is good to refresh my Spanish language skills. Having taken the classes back in high school (2005-08), this app helps me remember what I've mostly forgotten. A few glitches with having to reload (thankfully not reinstall) the app, but overall, a good quality app. 😁"
"Excellent Learning App, I love it and I use it everyday, makes it very fun and engaging. I would like it if they had an option to turn off the leader board bc I want to do it daily without having to always keep up with the leader board. Also I really liked it when they had the podcasts, I find them very fun and engaging and was so disappointed when they turned it off. Anyway excellent app should definitely get it!"
"So far, I love this app. They make learning a new language fun. Using several techniques (reading, translation, speaking, listening, repetition, and more), so there is continual reinforcement so you don't forget what you previously learned. They ask why you want to learn a language and start your training with language and words geared towards your goals. Now I find myself thinking in Spanish. I'll probably come back after I feel a bigger accomplishment and move my reading to a 5!"
"EnjoyI love the app, but continue to have an error message that has held me up from advancing. I have sent three emails with a screenshot of the issue. I have only received a robot email and no response to how to fix it. I am a Super Duo user. I am about ready to cancel the subscription and find another language app!!!"
"Started out loving this. Majored in French in college, and this is bringing it back in an easy and fun way. Add'l comments: After 6+ months, I can now add that what it lacks is a good conversation feature. You only get to speak one sentence at a time. I also wish there were better explanations, more grammar study, and more verb conjugation. Sometimes I have questions, but the discussions and comments have been closed for years, and there's no way of asking. There are shortcomings..."
"It's good for vocabulary, awful for grammar. 0 lessons, just throws words at you repeatedly. Takes 40 lessons to learn a new word. It is interactive and fun, and challenges you to do lessons each day, but the lessons could definitely be better. Still going over the words ""man"" and ""woman"" 12 units in is pretty sad."
"Almost a month in, I'm definitely having fun learning with this app. I feel like it needs some more explicit guidance on grammar topics (beyond the simple and often easy to miss tips), the difficulty can be very up and down due to this. Wish you could mark words as ""hard"" to review them more often but it all feels random. VERY gamified, for better and worse. You can learn with this for sure, but additional outside sources will make it easier."
"It's a great app, it'd be nice though if it le me look up specific courses to practice. Like let's say I want to learn all the numbers, that'd be a course I could choose. Or if I wanted to learn foods and beverages, that'd be another course I could choose. That'd be a very helpful update that could maybe be added to super duolingo. Then I'd give this a 5 star rating."
"Duolingo is great for a language learners. The ads are definitely manageable and I rarely get them. There is a placement test to put you in a lesson, which is why I am going to be deducting. I feel like the placement test didn't place me as high as I should've been placed, but I appreciate the fact I didn't have to start from square 1. This is a really great app and if you want to learn a language, you should give it a try."
"If I could give this 3.5 stars, I would. Having used Duo on various platforms for a few years, I think at this point the gamification is getting in the way of the actual game/learning. It keeps interrupting with little statistics on how awesome the game is (yes, I know, I'm playing it) and focusing on XP and gems, when you can us gems mostly to...get more gems. On the plus side, it is *much* better at teaching a new alphabet than it was the last time I played."
"Positives: Over all good app. It gives you personalized lessons, things you have missed and stuff along those lines. Makes sure you can read and write. Weird sentences, but funny. Negatives: The alphabet. It does not include an alphabet, it it extremely hard to learn a language without an alphabet. Or it does not give any studying options. Note cards etc. Other than that, fact this is a good app to learn I would recommend this to any one of my friends in need of a learning language platform."
"Overall, I really like the app. Some improvements that would be great is being able to skip ahead if you define your initial skill level too low and one click to continue instead of two. Two clicks (one to submit your answers and another to continue) is frustrating especially when you are in the timed challenges."
"I love this app because it truly is simpler to learn different languages this way, however there are a lot of ads that really interupt the learning experience. And not everyone has extra money to pay for Super Duolingo. That's why I only gave this four stars instead of five. If there were fewer ads, then I would have rated this higher."
"4 stars because the concept is very well-thought-out and works on so many levels. So far, I'm not sure if this is the best language app out there, but holistically, in my experience it is. What I mean is, there are some really good apps for idiomatic expressions and day-to-day conversation and some very good apps for vocabulary but duolingo brings it all together. I am charitably docking a star because there are issues. They won't ruin learning but their are some glitches & a few minor glitches."
"It's really only valuable if you buy the subscription. When I was on the free mode it was tons of ads, and if you make 3 mistakes, you can't finish the lesson, which is a barrier to learning. My other issue is that with certain languages like Japanese, they don't explain why the characters suddenly change."
"It is a very good app to learn a new language. It takes you through the transition of beginner to advanced reiterating concepts so you can learn and all for free. Purchasing will get you more features to learn quicker, easier, and practice more. It does lack a glossary of terms already used so a person can easily refer to them. I wish it had one. I also wish the grammar tips were a bit more detailed, especially if one pays for the app. All-in-all it's a good language app."
"Duolingo is good for learning the sounds of a language and is great for getting a feel for speaking. The only thing I wish could have been done differently is including grammar charts. If you're like me and having grammar charts are helpful, this should not be your only resource for learning a language, seeing they don't include any charts. Overall a good app, though."
"The app makes learning the language so much fun!! Even if you don't pay for the subscription, it is still enjoyable, you are still able to make reasonable progress each day. But the subscription certainly helps you learn faster since you can make more mistakes, review your mistakes and finish a lesson without having to wait several hours before restarting. I wish the app would at least give you more than 3 ""hearts"" without the paid subscription, if we had 7 or 8 ""hearts"", I would give this 5/5."
Good app for learning at your own speed (and keeping those of us who need a little competition motivated). I have had issues with getting major vocab dumps at the beginning of a lesson while being expected to use words I haven't even seen yet and then struggling through the unit or practices because I haven't seen or heard a word enough while seeing other words phrases with almost annoying frequency. I would highly request a dictionary section of previously seen words with their pronunciations.
Great BUT Accessibility issues: If you use a screen reader or have an enlarged display or large text you are not able to get back to the third box to type in an answer. If you click in the third box first sometimes it will stay. If you resize your text smaller it comes back but then people who need large text can't see. Please make it scrollable to be more accessible or make those like the where you can choose the word and not have to type it in. It took a month of frustration to troubleshoot.
"Duolingo is a fun app and good for learning languages. In my opinion the lessons don't really get harder as you get further along. But it's fun to learn languages with your friends that you can add. There are weekly quests with one of your friends which makes me feel more accountable which is really nice! However, I DO NOT recommend claiming your reward later, you WILL lose your 100 gems (as I have lost SEVERAL times 😢), but you can claim your 30 minutes of xp later."
"Have been through several iterations with this app so kudos to Duolingo for trying to improve on things. However, each iteration always brings big changes. Grammar explanations get moved around and are hard to find. The discussion feature for asking questions has been locked now. Concepts get introduced in different levels in each iteration so something you haven't had yet shows up in a review ""test"" in a new iteration. Despite these frustrations, it's not a bad app and I mostly enjoy it."
"Day 12 and excellent Very basic and literally can speak just a few words. But is fun exposure and an entry point. The app is feature rich. The basic path is quite clear, open app and follow guidance. But its filled with things that are unclear at this point. Hearts, XP, freezes, chests, and more that probably are helpful. One problem is that even though I have used daily the streak failed presumably because it uses a 24hr time period vs calendar day. Will make it difficult to keep streaks going"
"Excellent program, except it's starting to sound ""woke"". I recently had a story about lesbians. Pertinent? Possibly. Necessary? Not in the context that was in the story. Otherwise, it is an amazing learning index. I really like how it teaches. I took Spanish in high school, this is years beyond that teaching. The app is enjoyable, and repeats necessary information that is challenging, yet obtainable. I just hope it doesn't sell out to political ideals!"
"It's good, but as always, there are limits to how well you can learn something on your own as opposed to having someone teach you who can observe and identify troubled spots. Also seems to assume you'll pick up sentence structure intuitively, which isn't always the case, but learning by doing is possible, if a little more difficult."
"After working with this program for a while, I finally gave up and uninstalled it. I came back to it last month and discovered a much improved product The Navajo language (Diné Bizaad) module has jumped quite a bit with some limited audio, which helps. The lessons are straightforward and easy to work with! There are still spelling issues; the program spells a word correctly then marks you wrong when you spell it correctly. It's a programming issue. You do need a free Navajo Keyboard app."
"Learning multiple languages, unfortunately I have trouble trusting the more niche languages when the more common ones are missing translations and sound bites. I've been reporting the ones I notice and hope everyone does the same for every hiccup they encounter. Otherwise this is a fantastic app. Wish there was some kind of swag we can earn from competitions or multi day streaks. Def worth it to get the unlimited plans, imo"
"I love this app. I've stuck by learning French for 2+ years, until recently reaching a point where I feel I probably need a tutor to move on. Decided to switch to Greek and still love the app. My complaint is that two times now I've come in first in the diamond league and not gotten credit for it in my achievements. It takes a LOT of work to reach that goal and it's disheartening to not get that reward. Otherwise, I think this app makes learning a language very fun."
"I've learned more using Duolingo, than I did in my (forced) Spanish class in high school. The only draw backs are far to Manu ads for the free version, some times misspelling is allowed and some times it is not, and they don't truly walk you through the feminine and masculine aspects as much as I believe they could to make the learning simpler. Otherwise, I would have rated this app a 5 star..... Great App overall."
"I prefer the old format. I like having more control over which lesson to do on a given day. When I am pressed for time, I want to choose a story or an easy lesson. Also, some topics are irrelevant to me and I don't need to dwell on them. There are more errors in the new format. In written English run-on sentences are incorrect. You use them extensively. If you had a go-to grammar option available at the beginning of each unit, as you used to, it would be helpful."
"Beware! It's addictive!!!! I am brushing up on 4 languages I took in school years ago. I easily play for an hour a day because it's so fun. The ads in the free version are short and one after each lesson. Pretty awesome for free language lessons! I just wish they offered Malti & Finnish. Just wanted to add that I upgraded to the paid version because I am returning to college & want to place out of foreign language classes. So far, Super is amazing!!"
It's almost great. So many times though it tells me I'm wrong and shows me a word I haven't learned yet. Sometimes I'll even try the new word and it will tell me I'm wrong and show another word. It's confusing and upsetting when you're trying to finish and you're losing out on points and XP because the app is wonky in that way
"Heart system doesn't just slow you down, it's actively discouraging. Ads are also way too loud, and make listening to the app hard if you don't want to blow out your ear drums. I debated giving three stars, but other than those problems, the app is good, and a better price than most language learning apps."
"I'm enjoying it. It has a nice feel. It does a good job of repetition. I'm a structural learner, however. I wish it would explain verb structure and conjugation, for instance. I've had to figure out for myself that shi and hen are forms of to be, but I don't understand when one or the other should be used."
"Duolingo is very fun for kids and adults to help them learn a new language. I recommend Duolingo for anyone who wants to learn a new language, although Duolingo doesn't have a very good study guide so you just have to remember the words for things. Also, if you make 5 mistakes you have to wait 4 hours for just 1 heart to regenerate. Overall, Duolingo is very helpful if you want to learn a new language."
I'm happy with the app but what irritates me is that it automatically selects 12 month subscription when you decide to try the trial. Not happy about paying 84 dollars when I was only planning on using it for a few months. Personally I would rather pay a monthly fee vs for a whole year. Just wish it was clearer about that.
"Learning a new language has never been more fun or easy. The lessons are intuitive, interactive, and broad. A mix of listening, speaking, and quiz-like questions make the learning experience better and faster. However, the heart system that discourages mistakes sometimes ruins the experience because the engagement is broken. There are ways to replenish hearts that do not require a paid subscription such as completing review lessons or watching ads. Great app, recommend to all learners!"
"Great app for language learning, may not have the greatest structure when it comes to lessons compared to more serious language learning apps, but I've gotten to conversational level thanks to Duo in French. This app is very helpful for increasing your knowledge daily. I would say that you get as much as you put in, and the amount you learn and how much you learn really depends how much time you put into working towards the proficiency you want. Have, and would strongly recommend."
"Great app, but I do have two suggestions. Phrases in lessons and challenges need to be more dynamic. Right now, phrases are very static and are repeated very often throughout challenges and lessons. I also wish there were a dictionary that shows the words you have learned so you can review them."
"Much better than just memorizing vocabulary! It is actually fun to try and learn this way, the goals and achievements make me stay on the app practicing because I am having fun, and I love being able to replay lessons to learn at my own pace. I have a learning disability but don't feel like I'm struggling, I'm so happy I decided to try! I just wish there weren't so many loud ads between lessons, they mess with my concentration."
I felt like my progress was pretty slow but it was pretty effective at engraining grammar and vocabulary in my head. Soon after it told me I had crossed the 2000 word threshold I switched my routine up and started reading simple story books and that's when I really saw progress. The app was great for building a solid base though. Not something I would like to use long term.
"If you want to learn a new language, duolingo is a GREAT app to learn from. Duolingo has many languages you can learn from & there are many lessons to complete which will help you on different topics! Although duolingo is a good app, it takes a while to learn it. I'm not saying that it doesn't take long to learn another language because it does take a while. Duolingo takes longer than needed. I've had it for almost a year & my experience so far is great other than the minor issues, it's amazing!"
"I have the paid version and am amazed at the progress I have made. My only complaint is that on a few of the lessons, they don't translate a phrase so you can check your accuracy and that would be most helpful. Having said that, the majority of the time, the translations are there. I also liked it when they had active user discussions on all the lessons as it was a great way to interact and find more information from other students but I am managing without that. It's just not as interesting."
"I like that there is lots of repetition. I feel it goes at just the right pace. I like the combination of verbal, visual and auditory learning. I do wish you didn't have to touch submit and continue with every answer. I also feel like it would be useful to explain grammar concepts like masculine/feminine and verb tenses. I'm familiar with some of this from studying French and think I would be really confused otherwise"
"I love this app. This is a very engaging and well thought out app. I would love for Duo to offer the option of excluding certain exercises, especially, the writing exercises. Making the writing exercises optional would really assist younger users, or users who struggle with writing, and or spelling. My kids use the app, one of which is dyslexic, and it makes it difficult for him to level up, and I can see how much it frustrates him. We've adapted by using the mic to generate text."
"I wasn't sure if i was going to like it because I didn't like it's competitor. The layout and flow of this language learning app is engaging. You can work on more than one language on your account too. The only thing that I wish or haven't figured out is how to make the game more forgiving on little mistakes. I use it to become more fluent in speaking, but because written accent marks are counted as big mistakes, I am stuck doing lessons that are too easy for me. Then I start to get bored."
"Basically, a good app for language learning with the exception of the competition aspect. I am not a gamer and would appreciate the ability to turn off the competition portion of the app. Also, the running out of hearts so you must buy more is a detrement to learning. I have quit because I ran out of hearts when I would have preferred to continue that session! That concept was not well thought out. Please give us the ability to opt out of the gaming. Also, what are Gems for? What do they do?"
"The app is a lot slower since the update. Sometimes nothing loads after I've finished a lesson and I have to exit the app. When I'm back on, it hasn't saved my progress or I have to wait for it to appear, and when it does, it hasn't registered in quests. Sometimes I can't click anything and I need to restart the app. Those are what I would consider minor bugs because it doesn't stop me from learning, but it does get (really) inconvenient and annoying. Apart from that, it remains a good app :)"
"Pretty helpful. Progress is a bit slow, as you have many lessons repeating the same thing. The leaderboard can make me competitive and stressed, diverting my attention from actually learning. So if it could be made optional it would help. App itself can be slow to load, inconvenient when in a hurry. The grammar lessons need to be more detailed. Otherwise, I like Duolingo."
"Duolingo is very useful for learning vocabulary and basic sentence structure. It isn't as clear about teaching grammar, but it isn't difficult to make accurate assumptions based off the examples given plus some Google searching. It feels well-designed to want to make you keep coming back and learning a new language, a lot like a game. The one thing that keeps it at four stars for me is that sometimes, when I save up 100 gems to attempt a trophy level, the app crashes and I lose all of my gems."
"New UI is terrible. I do my legendary course in German and every time when i start the app, green Owl drops me down to the last golden unit. I have to scroll up about eighty units!!! Are you serious??? The most efficient tool for learning - STORIES can be considered unavailable any more because they're scattered all over the tree.. But we can change the color of the icon on the phone screen (Was it really necessary?) I'm disappointed. Hopefully, all these issues will be fixed."
"As someone without any prior knowledge in learning a new language Duolingo made it seem easy and I'm seeing tangible progress just under two months into it. It isn't the greatest at teaching you the differences and situations to use formal/informal versions on words/phrases which can make it difficult to understand certain exercises, but I think overall the app is a great place to start your journey into multilingualism. Just be sure to support your learning with other means as well!"
"It is a great app, of course, although one of my problems with it is some of the listening exercises. They ask you to identify the audio, although it isn't very useful if the text is transliterated or uses English text with the same pronunciation for certain letters. My point is that certain exercises are unnecessary, and to remove them would be useful aswell as providing a report feature for mistakes. I tend to opt for disabling audio for 15 minutes, albeit I may miss out on translating audio."
I'm new I've see the old and new layout it's fun and there's about everything in this app hope it gets better with time. So far I have good time going live and join a family who really funny and interesting also I see more people join. Hope it add more futures foen the road it be popping 😎😉
"I like the app, specifically when I'm bored. The only issue I have is since the last update, my screen freezes even though I can hear everything. When I'm typing it freezes as well."
"🥰 I have been on theis bigo live streaming application and I have never faced any kind of issue on it, this is really cool and awesome platform to connect with whole world just on your device screen I really like the option of sending gifts through which you can send gifts to your love one and wish them your beautiful day through this bigo app. Thank you bigo 🥰"
"Hi, really good app but I bought diamonds and they are not showing on the app at all. Please help Edit- it seems it's not showing my diamonds so I don't know what I have left. Please help. Thanks"
"This app has a lot going on! Definitely enough variety when it comes to activities, events, styles of LIVE stream, the people you meet, start a community vlog or and that's not even mentioning the games, themes, gifts. Even worldwide contests, events... It's in its own world and scheme of things but gifts and time spent (if Official host) you can earn real payout. Good stuff! Messages are delayed most of the time. Pretty difficult to get beenkŕ cuz"
So far lots of interesting nice people are here and trying to help others seems like the over all attitude of most of the other users I've been in contact with all in all it's been a good experience my only complaint and the reason I didn't give 5 stars is all the notifications I'm getting are sometimes too much to deal with i can't clear them fast enough as soon as i clear some more pop up
"Fun app and I enjoy making new friends online. However, me and my friends get banned on lives even when the lives aren't breaking any bigo rules and there are lots of mean people who kick others out for no reason but other than these couple problems, it's a good app!"
"It's a good app, but this app is not very well advertised and would fair much better if so, regional rules are still a bit clunky and could be worked on more, otherwise great enough, 4 stars."
"Very entertaining app, I really like it. My only problem is the way they block people, please allow us to have that little fun from the ladies."
"This app is good for improve the speaking power. Make friends. Watch fun live streams, chat with people from around the globe, and get rewards. All the best. I like it."
I love this app but beware of your security settings in app appear on top as well as your device settings other than that I love it!!! Tons of content for everyone never dull moment very addictive but in the good sense and in the same sense you end up making a lot of friends. Added 01/14/2023 *One more thing when playing the in-app games make sure you have a strong internet connection VPN. Nothing worse than betting big and winning and you get an error message bet cannot be placed. 😡😤🤬😠
It's ok live stream but has up's and down parts but depending who's person is sharing with I guess within your conversations it's Trump tight or file shoot because you off scale of point shot maybe apparently what governor itself choose it's own but hardly on it nor few sites when I need to laugh I know were to go to gets some joy!
Its a great app..you can earn through through live streams and you can find more friends anywhere..i hope i can earn more..good luck to me..
"It's absolutely a good experience for engaging myself to the BIGO app because aside from you can earn money, you can also interact with lots of people from the different countries around the globe♥️♥️♥️"
"Great app, needs to improve a lot though to get rid of the fake bots but other than that, not bad..."
I am a host! And I am so excited for the spring season. I absolutely love how I can share my hobbies and passions with others all from the comfort of my safe space(home)🤣. Download the app and get to meet ppl from all over and network. If I had to leave some constructive criticism it would be that I do wish they would find a way to get the trolls offline because they are not hosting or gifting and its just discouraging at times to have a lot of viewers with no diamonds in their wallet.
Great app I am hoping for new features and other things coming from this app it's a great app keeping in mind you need coins and be aware of your account
The app is good and I get I need people but the problem is I think there's people from Nigeria is trying to scam people and hide their identity by using this app
"I've to get used to this site 😭 as it has a lot going on at one time!!!??? ❤️ But other than that, it seems to be pretty cool 😎 😁!!!"
This app has two of my favorite ppl in the world on it. Its ok but hard to understand without help .
This app is really wonderful! It can keep you company when you are alone.
"The app is alright. I would like to request for ""Dark Mode"" option to be added for upcoming update. Thank you"
"I love it, but it can be alittle over stimulating. It has alot going on in lives and it becomes a little much"
"Addicting for social butterflies. Love the app and the circle I have found. It isn't the most simplest streaming apps but they have done a good job at labeling alot so anyone with common sense will be able to figure it out. Always use caution, luckily the app has features that allow you to provide some security from fakes and scammers. Keep improving and I'm sure BiGo will be worth the full 5stars but not quite yet."
Bigo you really need font that's for visually impaired people.. the words on the screen are entirely to small.. I can't read the comments 😡
It's good to an extent but not everyone will follow guidelines. I have no problems yet but if I do y'all will be notified. I give it 4 for now.
I have been on bigo for almost 4 years as a host now I am a founder of a family the only thing I can say that's negative is that we have so much support from all over the world but know there is new rules were overseas gifts don't help you I think that should change it will bring a lot of people back to the app. I have someone from south Africa in my family and its very difficult to help each other reach quota with new rules. Please change it so all gifts count
"App requires some basic IT skills that are pretty simple but potential users should not expect simple ready to use out of the box product. As the case with everything we buy the item should make clear the ""Some assembly is reequired."""
"You take the time to get to kinda know someone and they pop off the screen,and you never here from them. ,Wast of time."
Fun and entertaining takes awhile to get to know everything on but overall you have a good time
"just like it been on there on and off ,4 or 5 times nice people lots of losers tho wanting gift cards I'm out of that no gift cards from me but I like this girl well a couple but I'll never see them probably so I can at least talk to them nothing nasty but it's something to do"
Good platform. Instructions and info a little vague but learning.
Good app.... Can you have an in app protection like a password or fingerprint...
I enjoy all of the videos just start to let them do more if they want to
"It's Interesting in So many ways. I get the chance to talk to so many People. Most Don't speak To me but it's Ok. I come on Daily for the past 3months. I Have Meet Some Amazing Woman & Men that have Taught me the Ropes of the App. I now get little to No Gift's. But it's Fine. I Enjoy letting Folk watch me Cook , listen to the Music . Sometimes folks try to get me in Trouble by reporting me Falsely.But it doesn't matter. Because I don't do anything Wrong. I Enjoy Good Vibes From Unique people."
"I enjoy this app. But I'm shy to talk to others, and alam ko masasanay din po ako."
A little difficult to navigate but I'm still having fun learning.
It's very nice looking for job and to your friends are coming with different types works have knowledge
Bigo for me helped me through my social anxiety. It's definitely great to network for me.
The app works fairly smooth for me. Only bad thing is everyone is a scammer on there 😞
"It seems to do allot but its rather messy ,choppy and confusing."
"Found it, and turned it off but they're still creeping through."
Great app for fun. Seeing the sites and amazing anchors ⚓️
"Stressed reliever, just for fun,meet with defferent kinds of people.etc."
"I will say this app has improved a lot since I last used it. The moderation is better, there are more chill people and the app runs well. My only complaint are the chats. I know that there is almost no way to fix it, but it is sad to see so many people harass someone to, and I quote, ""full open show 👙"" If we can find a way to fix that, it would be great."
I haven't been on this app for very long and it's really interesting. At the touch of your fingers you can talk to anybody anywhere in the world there's all kinds of content just about anything you can think of is on here. So far it's been a fun easy to use and captivating. I'm definitely have to start making some time for this app because there's a lot I want to see on here.
The app is cool. And can be fun. I meet new people everyday. It's not as easy to be a host. It's like having another job. But I still like it. The admins/customer serves sucks!!! The rebates are always missing.
I like the app it's fun and I have an opportunity to make some money on there but Ive lost the ability to follow people back and it's kinda making it hard as a host that can't follow their viewers back.
It is a social media and is a definite manner to relate with others. The gaming animation is rich and no short of visitors. Seemingly will grow with time as well as amplify the variety of social media encounters. It is what it is...
You give give give on this app to the broadcasters but there is nothing for the gifters who supports. If it wasn't for the gifters this app would not make it. This app will cause you to be broke. The broadcasters don't notice you unless you are a big gifter. There are barely any wins on the lottery anymore. I love the family I'm in but I can no longer afford it. Thinking about deleting the app. The took my main page in which I had a lot of followers and had spent thousands on and it for no reas
very nice app. Anyways the thing that I don't like here in bigo is that they are allowing Adult content which im open with in the other hand it's not suitable for teenagers. It's better for them to be educated in a way that their questions will be answered correctly. Not in a way that they will be addicted to something they don't really understand.
It's really nice but I think you should add for the multiple room experience like the virtual character. I love the virtual character thing because I get akward and shy when people see my face. 4/5
"Having issues with some background functions..... galaxy A53....it also props me to rate the app- which I have...and every time I do a live- it brings me to the playstore, as if to update it...but it says open not update. ;/"
"I wish I could rate it with zero if it was possible, last month me and my friend we we auditioned and became new hosts, we did hour hours but bigo did not pay us the money for hours, I told my agent about this, he is still waiting for bigo's response, even today I did not get response, I wasted my time and data for nothing. Bigo is a huge scammer and I really hate the app. Second review I got my money and thanks bigo, now I'm gonna rate with 5 stars"
its good app i loved it But recently update got weird i open youtube and i wont search a thing i had to search same words more then 15 times please check if their Glintch in youtube search Overall its good app if i dont find any one to talk to or not interested in this aap get youtube option at bar with 3 lines
Very good I had it on. My other phone lgdsliders 5g bites Motorola.
it's okay I feel there's re some fakes on here just trying to get money. put it's good to talk to some of them anyeays.
Everything was alright with the experience I just don't understand how to get the money from my phone to the 52 diamonds and all that other s*** working tipped it took the people into speakers are I reset it
"I love love love this app,best app to meet new ppl have fun be urself and earn money while having all this fun"
Everything is oky.. Best app for International communication person
The number of live streams you can do is nice. Plus it's like your hanging with friends in your house.
"I like it is very nice app, but sex photo is too much there. I don't like it ."
"The app is easy to use. There are a variety of streamers to choose from. I haven't had an official stream yet, just test runs. My only complaint/suggestion would be the PC live connector. I don't like that it automatically starts the stream before the setup. There should be an option to set up everything, then start the live. Once the live starts from there it is pretty easy to use. The automatic start is annoying though. That's what is keeping me from giving a 5-star rating."
Seems like a good app to have except it has no real capabilities for vision impaired people! The screen reader on your phone is not very useful unless you can see what's going on on the screen! I think that if you want more people in that catalog 2 take it or take to it you might want to think about that
"When I first downloaded this app, I had no problems downloading movies. But after updating this is getting to the point where either you get premiums play or delete app. I upgraded. But it's too late."
"The app won't allow me to update my bio, it's saying something like ""Failed. Please check your network and try again."" I don't understand why it's doing that, it's my first time updating my bio. I hope this problem can be resolved quickly."
"The cool so far ,it's nice to chart with different kinds of people Can't seem to follow people but for me the app is cool"
"The app is really cool. I've been using it for about 3 months and it is working fantastically but recently, my phone keeps on lagging whenever i open the app making me unable to watch video and audiolives anymore. I thought the problem is my internet connection but it shows that the signal is strong and stable, my phone is also in a good condition and still has a wide storage capacity. ok idunno na😭"
Lag sometime from Samsung devices but overall quality is good
It's has better video and social ability then most apps enjoy it!!
Would like a better bean conversion to diamond .. Great place to meet new ppl but this app isn't for the weak
Made lots of friends. Good app. The location setup is good it keeps the conversation going. Hiding the exact location is a good thing.. Because no one wants wants their location to be shared unless they are willing to. Video quality is a bit low. I think its because of the camera or whatever i don't do video chats. 😁
"Lots of fake profiles,but the apps cool"
"It was good, but every time I'd click on a model, the screen would would come back to this screen!"
It's good though it's been a mixed though... it's okay but there's always room for improvement.
Its nice to see some people and be friend enjoy watching live vedio
"Why can't I see my live data, although I have not been on the app for long"
I like BIGO for fun and networking with all the people I meet
It's really hard to play fisher here in bigo ... I hope you' ll fix it... Thank you
I think it's A much better app. In comparison with other apps. that's compared to it. Farron Wayne Gilley 🌹
Interesting platform ever enjoyed
Complicated but worth learning the ropes
It is a good app for communication
Wats up is a lot more chatter and subline txt for ppl who love too chat
Quick and easy
Very poor from you folks. I have lost my password. Tried to reset it. But i never get that verification code on my mobile number. Tried to reach you guys mulitple times over e-mail but no response from your side. I do even have a VIP subscription. That's really disappointing how you treat premium customers. Kindly escalate this matter as quickly as possible... The problem is not rectified. Thanks for the help. Will update positive rating now.
"This app is good but it can be better. I suggest that instead of hosts actually having to prepare during streaming, I think that letting the hosts have a testing or preview of what their live stream and audio would definitely be a big help. It can lessen technical difficulties during streaming and it lets host prepare before pressing the live button."
"All in all, I like everything about the app design and its features. However, I would really appreciate Bigo app developers to include an option to mute the game music when playing Bigo Ludo. The music, sometimes, becomes unbearably annoying when playing longer rounds. I hope that you reconsider my request in your future update."
I love Bigo. Help ease my mind when I have a lot going on.
"Update: Norton now rates as green. No invasive banners while notifications blocked. Moderation is over zealous, but app performs as expected so revised score to 4 stars. Norton Anti Virus rates this red: privacy risk. Not worth it. Invasive. Pop up notification / ""hey let's get to know each other!"" Banner on home screen...when notifications were blocked. No permissions and not allowed to appear on top of other apps."
"It's a great conference calling experience. The only reason for the one less star is there is no guidance on how the gifting and bean conversion or anything works. I felt thrown to the wolves learning to navigate. I recommend a tutorial to be added! Other than that, I love it!"
Seems great so far I'm enjoying meeting people from around the world Just really enjoyed my first live session and found that I can chat for nearly half an hour about nothing at all. Great fun
"I enjoyed the app, it actually seemed allot like live feed from other social networks we have broadcasting people throughout the world. Now if we included some extra features things would become allot more interesting, and then incorporate this into other established broadcasting network's. This would be awesome to include other features on primary devices."
"Since I am new on the app so will observe and will post accordingly, however seemingly app is doing well. In Re-review session I found some pitfalls in it, some people use absolutely abusive language and they are unfortunately much experienced members and also game portion is not much favorite portion..... sometimes it seems meaningless, however some accounts are wonderful.... also arrogance is in Vogue on bigo...."
"This is a great app, I would also recommend it to friends, this is the best brodcasting app I know of, 😂😂, don't know why I thought there was something to record a brodcast on however long you want it and have to phone, and in also love it. Tho when my friends brodcast and open boxes why can't they let people in now, it then says operation failed."
"Honestly I've only had this app maybe a week and barely use it but it's cool, a little too much be going on on the screen though and there isn't enough press and hold options to explain stuff. For example I was just on and there was a (SL) symbol in the top right corner of the bell gift but idk what for. And the random notifications from people I don't even know talking about they miss me or been waiting for me when I'm following one person."
its very interesting app actually also met good ppl and support who needs but there are 2 things i want and wish you to fix them.. first one is the pk predection ... i tried it many times when i lose i lost the crystals and when i win only the crystal that i predict with come back to me.. its says 1.3 or x2 but its not working this bug need to be fixed.. second problem is that when we recharge from app is very high compaired to the bigo.tv so can you please make it easier for ppl to recharge
"My experience has been great, there are alot of gifts available and you can attain alot of gifts by simply completing challenges (a great alternative to money purchases). I had a great time watching my friends on the app and will recommend it to those who wish to view and seek a broadcasting platform."
"Entertaining app, however I wish there were a way to limit the amount of notifications received, or prioritize certain users. It seems as though the only way to truly control it is to either turn off notifications, or individually visit profiles and disable notifications one by one."
Its a gd app but it drains my battery and makes my phone hot too much.... also there needs to be a share all button to friends and i should be able to look up a friends name to share. And also when im hosting a live we should be able to recharge and cam down as well as the people joining us in the live. But its all and all a good app itd be better with those fixes
"I ❤️ Canva! Pro is SO WORTH IT! Suggestion: background remover, has the manual erase/restore feature but even with my s-pen, it's impossible to get straight edges. A shape function that could automatically wrap the object would be great. Also erase/restore tab covers half the image. If you try to minimize it just closes out the entire function. If you try to zoom in, you may not get the area you need. Zooming out makes it too far away to do anything."
"I gave it 4 stars. It's a excellent app. Easy to use. The only issue I have is if I want to select all the elements on a page for centering, the multiple select is frustrating. I'll almost have everything I want selected but if I don't press the next one perfectly it deselects everything and I have to start over. Multiple select is fine for a few things, sections and such. But there needs to be a select all option also."
"This app has such a huge library of templates, for media, for backgrounds, for fonts, stickers and can be seamlessly combined with your own creative uploads. The only drawback I have found is with my phone canva really struggles with large files, including drone videos, consistently causing the app to crash. I've also noticed the app has trouble with uploading landscape orientation material to a landscape template"
"An incredible free editor, but with one small issue. If you have a slow connection, the video playback starts to struggle to load. If the devs read this, it would be greatly appreciated if they were to add a feature to scale down playback resolution for slower connections. Otherwise, great editor, especially for school projects!👍"
"Overall CanvaPro has been great. There are a few annoying traits like sometimes when you're trying to move an object or text box over a miniscule amount and it tends to ""jump"" just beyond or just short of where you want it. It would be cool if users were able to input their own angles for shapes likes triangles or trapezoids instead of only having the pre-made ones. Sometimes you just need a very specific looking isoceles triangle, you know? 🤷🏼‍♀️"
"I absolutely love using canva, I have been using it for years. The only thing I'd want changed is an easier way to navigate the starred folder. I wish I could easily search and use categories to find what I'm looking for much simpler such as having categories such as ""stickers, Instagram post, Facebook post, etc"" and to freely search for a particular thing."
"I love this app, and the subscription is relatively cheap, which is awesome. However, there's been a few functions that seem to be a very sensitive (buggy) lately. Resizing the text boxes hasn't been easy. They jump around and don't allow for the box to actually fit around the text anymore. Not sure what happened, but I hope there's an easy resolution in the near future."
"Used to be better, but still useable for many projects. I was a fan from the start and was very happy with the templates. As the company grew, many images, templates etc are all at a premium. Recently, I noticed the export/download option for selected pages disappeared from mobile, which is super annoying bc it downloaded all my 50 pages over and over again for the one new page."
"Canva has helped me since college, and I regularly use it in my career. I really love the intuitive nature of the platform, and find it easy to use. It would be helpful to have a feature where you could see and manipulate layers outside of the main workspace, because sometimes graphics get stuck behind one another and the only way to retrieve them is to alter your contents. Overall, I really enjoy this platform as a creative outlet and professional tool."
"DO NOT PURCHASE CREDITS. You can only export in PNG when you have a subscription (and there are a bunch of other things that require a subscription and do not use credits) so the credits end up being kind of useless. Great program for making logos and branding stuff. Probably would have been cheaper to hire a designer but I learned a new skill! I recommend making your designs first and then, when you're happy, pay for the subscription."
"I like the browser site more. It's just more fluid and much more easy to use. The mobile app works in a pinch and is fantastically fun no matter where I create my banners, thumbnails, short videos, and advertisements, and all things social media. Canva is my most favorite creative app ever! It's so easy to get lost in my world of creating new stories and fun graphics for all occasions. I would like to see some change in the mobile app. Some of the features are difficult to maneuver. 💯"
"Great app. Haven't used it much yet. Need to take a deeper dive. So far, pretty easy to use, intuitive. Some times it seems to not respond when I press a button/feature. Have had to close and reopen the app a couple times. It can also be very tricky to line things up just right; maybe a 'snap' feature or a grid system could be useful. Despite these little set backs it really is a great app."
"Super awesome! Currently using the free version, but even with that there's so much potential and functions in designs. Canva makes designing easy and fast, especially when you're all out of ideas. 4 stars because the design of my business cards are always misaligned when ordered, so I'd always have to notify them of this issue. I wished that it'd be done correctly the first time to minimize waste (100 cards+) but even then, fixing the issue needed a second fix. 5 stars if they get this right ."
"Pretty great. As an artist creating a new resume for a position within the gaming industry, I was worried about my creativity being limited... But there's a pretty decent amount of options. My one gripe so far is that there really should be [more] options to line objects up. Gets pretty sloppy. Some things will automatically but that only happens when you put something in just the right spot. For a free app, I'd definitely recommend! Great for anyone within one of the art industries."
"The app is extremely convenient for quick edits if I'm away from my PC, but the layout could be more intuitive and easy to use. For instance, when you select an icon or photo, it closes out the selection window. If you wanted to insert multiple elements/photos at once, you would have to reopen the window and retype your query every time. That said, no encounters so far with bugs or crashes, and the quality of mobile downloads is just as good as downloads to PC."
"Truly excited about this app. Well done! I love how clean and smooth it is (usually). I almost gave it five stars because I love it so much, but there is one problem. I had uploaded all my photos to the computer version however and can't seem to access thise fron the app, which makes me sad. I also wish it were easier / more obvious how to retitle the designs. These problems are easy enough to work around with the computer but a little inconvenient. Still love the app!"
"Please fix the issue with text not staying in place after uploading to Instagram. Lately it has been happening more often. *Update 10/31/19: Bumping 3 🌟 to 4 🌟. App has been working well, and if it starts acting up, I am reminded to check for updates. Two requests, can you make the font selection more mobile friendly, It's a pain having to preview font styles and having to start from the top again and scroll all the way down. And alignment tools."
"I love Canva. I use it on almost a daily basis for things I need for my podcast, and for my actual business as well. The upgrade to Pro was worth it in the first week alone. My only complaint is that every now and then, my text box will stop working, so I have to close the app and reopen it, and on 2 occasions a graphic didn't download my color changes, but it was fixed right away. I def recommend for ease alone."
"Great app! Easy to use, tons of free templates, and a fairly intuitive interface for detail work. My only complaint is that about half the time when I use my keyboard in it the keyboard refuses to go down when I click out of the text box, which is a little annoying, but can be solved by going to my home screen and hitting the back button. All in all, love it!"
"Excellent resource for quickly building a variety if graphics. The app isn't as easy to use as the desktop version, but is still very good for everything it tries to do. Depending on speed of your connection and mobile device, it can sometimes be tough to get elements resized perfectly on a design, but I've found that if you build it on the desktop first then do small edits, or just use the app to brainstorm for later desktop editing, it almost perfect."
"I enjoy using this program, and use it often to create charts, games, study guides, etc... but its difficult to make changes with the shape boxes. I suppose the layering makes it difficult to get to the first items added. It would be nice to be able to center things without having to manually move it. And have charts available that can allow cells to be divided many different ways."
"It's a good app. I been very limited in the time I've had to use it. Everything I've had to do has been quickly and intuitively done with this app. With no direction, I've created photo collages, graphics for presentations and several other things, earning compliments from my Co- workers and supervisors. I recommend the app if you need to get something done and have it look great!"
"90% awesome. I use it to make all types of social media posts and flyers for our non-profit organization. The editable templates are great and a time saver. The resize option is fantastic! Every now and again, the download is off center. And there are some options that seem like that should be included, like a basic straight line where you can adjust the thickness."
"Great app. Easy to use, fun to do, and yes... free. The only reason I would not rate it 5 stars is because of how it downloads some of the stuff. Some fonts (even free ones) or pictures just dont show up after you download your picture or slideshow/video. I do love that there is no ads. Although not everything is available for free, it's still pretty amazing."
"Pretty fun to make some simple logos. It's inhibiting when you want to duplicate what they give you to start, like a little capsule shaped blob. You can't duplicate, only add what other little stickers they have. Once you add an additional sticker, you can't write over it with text easily. And, it saves it in PNG files and so is not transferable to a place like shutterfly to get my image printed on, say, a magnet when they only can use JPGs. So, while it's fun to use, real life use escapes me."
"it's a little difficult to navigate at first and to figure out how to layer your elements and get things just how you want them. Once you fumble around a bit it's pretty simple to use. Really easy way to create what I needed for all my social media platforms. I love the simplicity of the YouTube thumbnail and banner templates, I don't have to mess with any resizing to make my creations work on my social platforms. I wish there were stickers or some sort of .png to layer."
"Pretty decent app but a lot of frustrating things that it won't let you do. setting up a chart, changing rows or columns or applying changes to an entire chart makes you want to die!!!it's almost impossible to change the appearance of a chart other than the thickness/color. if you don't use a template it's almost impossible to manipulate it whatsoever. I've tried both the Android & Windows versions of the app on & offline, still have the same problems. I have Pro, chart maker doesn't work!"
"It is super easy to develop beautiful graphics. There is room for improvement in the way it displays your projects; it can e a hassle to try to dig through and find what you're looking for. Also, the content planner tool would be significantly more helpful if you could schedule stories and reels. An option to slowdown videos would also be fantastic. All in all, I really like the ease of the tool. Good value for its price"
"Canva is easy to use and has a great selection of stock photos/templates for use. My only problem is that it gets a little glitchy if working with a document with several different items added. Copying/pasting an item works, but it doesn't show up until you kill the app and relaunch it. Fix those little interface problems and it'll be 5-stars all day long."
"This app has been very helpful. I have created several flyers so far & am now working on my first poster. Its simple to use and offers most of the options I would need. There have been a couple of frustrating things I've come across, one being that there isn't an option to ""justify"" the text. Another is that when I pull the text box out wider to allow more room foe the text on the page, it increases the font size. Yes, I would improve some things but its still a solid, easy to use app."
"Fabulous app for quick graphics for entrepreneurs. Would love to be able to CHANGE the orientation of my images [i.e rotate.flip.mirror] within the app or maybe I haven't figured it out yet • NEED FIXES 1) on uploading images from Google photos, it never loads images 2) after one of the latest updates, when duplicating/copying an image in creating canvas, the item is not in the same layer anymore. It's on top of all of the other items. I really enjoyed the item duplicated being on the same layer. I'm faithful user and am grateful for the continuous updates and improvements for this app....highly recommend! 😘😉👍"
"Still needs a lot more features, but I guess that would improve with time, still a great app to use. One of the features I'm looking forward to is having a cutting or razor effect where you can adjust elements to your taste, and also if possible all elements should be able to be adjusted from all sides not just the 4 angles options we have, that makes it less flexible"
"So this app is great and very resourceful for designing whatever you need. I designed and printed business cards with them. The designing part was great as it comes with ALOT of free fonts and art you can add. But unfortunately I wasn't 100% happy with my prints. I think they may print on recycled paper, which is great🌏, but the hue of the paper changed the visualsl on my cards. They look duller than I wanted. All in all 8/10.."
"I like the app. Its very useful. I realize that its probably a marketing strategy, but it would be nice if there was a way to filter out the graphics, photos, and etc. that are exclusive to canva pro users only or come with watermarks. That way I wouldn't have to waste time looking through every single option that isn't avalible to a free account. Otherwise, its a great app."
"I lllove Canva! It's perfect for my personal and professional design needs. I love the easy templates and the sharing feature. My only feedback is that I'd add 1) guidelines for aligning elements on tablet. 2) I wish the graphic shapes were a bit more flexible/easy to work with. 3) Instead of one brand kit, I'd like multiple campaign kits (for multiple clients)."
"Some features took a little time to get the hang of, especially when going back and forth between the mobile version and the Chromebook. But relatively easy to use, and for the free version, still has a lot of casual design power! Happy with the capabilities and useful for generating ideas."
"I love using Canva! The only problem I have right now is that it glitches at times. It signs me in multiple times, where it looks like I'm working from another device. Also, when I am trying to do certain things, it will not do it or it will not save. Other than the glitches that happen, and are quite frustrating, I love the creative things I've made using this platform."
"Excellent app for interesting instagram stories. Sometimes it doesn't properly save my projects and for some reason no longer allows users to download the image to their phone. It used to, ever since this feature was removed everything became unnecessarily more difficult. Still, I get a lot out of it and am grateful. Recommend it."
"I love this app! I even got a subscription because of how much I used it for my business. Lately, my text and graphics that are being added are not showing up. It is like they a hiding. I have tried each time to move the particular item to the top of every, but it just disappears. I can click it and edit it then it will show, but once I am not editing it doesn't show.... it is becoming very frustrating."
Overall pretty great. I can edit videos and make really unique flyers. The only issue that I've run into is that after a while completely stopped working on my computer. Still haven't figured that one out kind of an inconvenience but I'm figuring it out elsewhere. Otherwise 10 out of 10 would recommend.
"First review was *****. Now, though, after the most recent update, I can't use it on my S20 Ultra. The image it saves is not the image I've created, the text runs off the screen with no way to adjust it. I really hope another update is pushed through fast! Update: The new update made things marginally better, and I was able to create a beautiful instagram post. However, when uploaded to instagram, the text is sacrificed up in one area of the image and it doesn't look at all like what I'd made."
"It's really easy to use, however saving what you just made is quite hard and very slow. You might be in a risk of losing your work you spent an hour or more on. When I press save, the menu just disappears but it actually didn't save anything and I can't leave the app without fear of my thing disappearing or losing progress I have made. Since I only make images and not videos, I can luckily screenshot what I have made in case of my work not saving; However, kinday worried about making videos."
"9/15 Update: Finally fixed! After deleting and reinstalling app after their reply its back up and working!! I'm an old school ""paint"" lover. Simple yet effective. This app keeps things simple yet allows you to do so much without that frustrating learning curve! Original: Loved this app, until now. It used to be great and worked perfectly. However it won't open, just crashes on start up and will say issues with network. Not sure why either. I have tried multiple things and can't get it to work."
"The previous version was much better. The interface now is cluttered and not user friendly. UPDATED: The technical issue of shutting down when uploading images has been resolved. However, the app is still cluttered and difficult to use. UPDATED: The most recent updates have made this year friendly again. Much, much better now."
"although i love having the app on my phone, the app isnt as good as the computer based version. the app is still canva 1.0 while web is already at 2.0. you dont get all the options the computer based version has. and it limits you to very specific ones. my workplace has the upgrade, and although it gives you more, the upgrade isnt amazing. sure you can make very basic designs, but i wouldnt say you can make a full blown logo with it. its a simple app that does simple stuff, simple & quick."
I've been using Canva on my desktop for at least 5 years and I was absolutely thrilled to try their mobile app! Haven't tried paying through the app yet (for premium elements) but other than that I've tried out all the mobile app's functions and the UI is pretty well done considering how much they had to pack into a small sidebar at the edge of a screen. It's obviously more cramped than on the computer and downloading is tough but it's great for on-the-go edits. Would recommend!
"Looks like a nice design app. My only complaint is that it said something I tried to design, a logo, was supposed to be free...but when I went to save it, there was a watermark for the app that I couldn't remove without paying. That sucked and I honestly wouldn't use it enough to pay for a subscription. Without that issue, this review would be 5 stars."
Snooth running app with a lot of smart designs! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I once experienced a template where an element could not be customized because the app would not allow me to select it. I ended up having to abandon the entire project. Not sure if this could be an issue with other templates as well.
"it's a super helpful app with some really unique tools for amateur graphic designers. however, it's useful for beginner or basic level design, not more advanced ones like you would find in photoshop. great for making covers and basic moodboards, also invitations and core advertising media. if you want graphic design on a basic level, this is for you. one thing i didn't like, though, is that the paid and free content are mixed together under the same app. should be separated for different users."
"simple, straightforward, and easy to use; this app gets the job done and doesn't compromise the Canva quality templates and sizing/object features expected from one of the best (free) apps and hands down, in my experience (up until now) the best design app - in terms of something multifunctional and providing an efficient work process. It doesn't have extensive photo editing options and those needs; or too much in the free version when it comes to fonts. highly recommend. kudos, Canva team. 🤘"
"Amazing app!! I've been using it on the computer and on phone and helps get the job done quickly! A suggestion I have is to be able to edit the text in more ways, like curving and shadows, etc. And to be able to share to specific people from the team straight from the phone app. Other than that this app is amazing!"
"The only thing I don't like about the app vs the website is not being able to easily access my favorite fonts and colors I have favorited. I have to automatically have some basic things saved with my favorite colors, in order to edit them on the go. If this issue gets resolved it will totally be 5 stars! I really love Canva, I just want to have access to my fave colors on mobile..."
This is a useful app. A beginner can grab a template and make small changes to their needs. A more advanced user can make their own template and customize it. The subscription price is a little high for what you get. I'll reserve judgement until the trial drops off and I see exactly what the difference is. It's a nice app but not the only one that can do these things.
"one of the best apps for creating IG story content. the only feature I wish they had (or that I could find) is one that allows text over a single photo....I have only been able to find collage or templates that have backgrounds while pic is smaller. premium content is good but kinds expensive if you dont utilize app often. also when I try to save a single ""page"" from a created group it downloads them all."
"I love Canva! Best app for designing Instagram posts. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to look more professional. People have been taking my account way more seriously since I got this! However, on the iPad, you cannot pinch in the boxes which makes it harder to make them the right shape and size you want. I can do that on my phone however. Still an amazing app!"
"I love Canva. It's a lot easier and more convenient to make graphics, than using Photoshop. It has a few issues/glitches, like some times I can't download a design and have to close out the app/ browser and try again later. Pro has given me access to a lot more elements to use."
"Amazing app. Revolutionary for businesses, especially small businesses. Works well & has beautiful, useful content. Allows for a lot of creativity. There are some small differences from app and website, to be expected. It would be convenient to copy and paste within one design or across designs in the app, or drag text to another design page so it doesn't have to be added/created again. There are a few issues/bugs e.g., sometimes content doesn't share to social media with the same quality."
"This app is a lot easier to use on a phone than most design apps. One star off for the (always displayed) rotate button for elements, which is way too easy to hit by accident and then does nothing when you try to undo the error. Users should be able to hide that button if they aren't going to use it."
"Canva is a great app for creating stunning designs without any hassle. It has a user-friendly interface and a huge library of templates, fonts, icons, and images. You can easily customize your designs with drag-and-drop features and share them with others. One feature that I would like to see in Canva is text to video. This would allow me to convert my text into engaging videos with animations and music. It would be useful for making presentations, ads, and stories."
"I like the features available. A good alternative for Microsoft Office Applications. However, it is quite irritating when creating a document. The text glitches out and goes out of position. Sometimes it doesn't follow the format. I am trying to create an A4 file but the text keeps glitching out."
"The app itself is great but it takes ages to download any file, most of the times it takes multiple tries until it actually works. I'd understand if I had a weak device but that's not the case so I can't think of an excuse for such a thing, it doesn't even make sense to take 15 minutes to ""prepare your design"" to download 4 images"
"I enjoy using Canva, I've been using it for about two years now. It allows create beautiful designs but recently it's been giving me problems. Whenever I want to download a design I made using free templates, I am directed to a page that say ""Pay and Publish."" And this happens with free templates! Another problem I've experienced is that when I want to download a single page from a project of about 30 pages, it ends up downloading all the pages. It's frustrating and hindering my work."
"Although the app itself is seemingly okay, everything seems pretty well. But after a while, I've noticed/ observed that the loading takes more time,even if I look back at my old edits. Everytime I repeatedly open an new edit, it still takes usually an minutes to stop the loading. And I've been looking for reason on why is this happening. My Wi-Fi connection is quite strong tho."
"Overall great app. The desktop version is better though, for the fact that it is faster when it comes to loading, because this app takes FOREVERRRR to load. Sometimes when you download the file it also doesn't appear anywhere, and I have to go thru the struggle of opening my PC and downloading it there instead."
"The best app so far, totally recommend as it's an all in all editing app from filters to frames and templates for work purpose as well. Still, room for improvement is there. The screen lags sometimes and glitches as well. Other that a total recommend"
"Better experience in canva. But! There are many problems faced in using text. If it's so good that a page fills up, the extra text will automatically move to the next page. Another thing is that it is very good if the text is useful in multiple columns."
I love this app but I have certain issue in elements shapes please add a option edit points for shapes like Microsoft office and more shapes and elignment for text I can't arrange the whole paragraph correctly I should take one by one 😔 text and arrange them in order. this app is really good for graphic designing thankyou.
"I really love, how easy canva can be used by us, however, if canva want to improve its video editing part/tool, maybe canva should separate apps/website for video and photo, because i feel that, it is getting slower when loading the website or apps which is annoy me when i need it fast. And also perhaps you can add option to delete file only on 'your account' sometimes i don't need that files but i cannot delete it because it is from other account."
"I just wish it was easier to edit videos like splitting them, adding markers, adding texts and transitions, whether it's I wish they added separate lines like other video editors, you have your main video track line, then maybe a music line, a line for effects and transitions etc"
"great features, recently added the erase feature which is a plus. However, since the last update I am no longer able to upload videos to make reels or stories. Please fix."
"I've been experiencing an issue for a short while, but it's still there, even when I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app more than 3 times already... And it's that it gets stuck in the welcoming screen, telling me that it's taking longer than usual to load... But I have a good internet connection, and even when I reinstall it, it only works the moment I reinstall, but it continues giving that message later..."
"Great for creating many sorts of media. From a logo to a video, loads of templates, images, text, etc, on the free version. Very user-friendly and intuitive. Saves automatically and stores your files, bla, bla. You should try it!"
"this graphic design app is very cool and it's actually the best. Either way, it's totally awesome 😎 and rad. so I recommend this fully and totally... I use it especially to make literally everything from funny pictures to beautiful social posts to ethereal photographs, so please do use it, if you want to do this too..👍👍👍"
Edit They have resolved it. It works fine now with more details So i have been using this app for last two years it was fantasticaly amazing untill they came up with the update. Its very difficult to use. Its too much time taking. Please make it handy.. just worst experience i have ever had with canva.
"I have been a CANVA paid customer for quite long. I always have used this app for social media editions, videos and post. Very good in creating things. But now I went on printing business. All my designs are very low quality, not good for printing, you save it on pdf or svg and still bad resolution quality. I would like to save my designs on hight quality resolutions and SVG. The other problem is that when you sent your desing to be printed with them, it does not give you much in sizes options."
A bit hard to edit things on your phone unless you have a fine point stylus or teeny tiny fingers. Otherwise it's nice to have something I can use away from my desktop.
"It is indeed a good mobile tools for everything you can think of about video making and editing, website designing, graphic design etc. It will be more good if we can have a gradient effect for text as well,as we have it for shapes. And also including a noise effect on design will be a good experience."
"Canva Is a highly recommended app for beginners to graphic designing,,,,it helps you get a clue idea on how to design contents easier,,,but there's this Problem I Wish to complain,, which is the premium access,, almost all quality and nice graphics are of premium,,so it makes the app boring sometimes. I wish you work on that,,,at least reduce the premium version for us"
"Canva is a handy tool that I use to create flyers, post images, and even PowerPoint presentations. For me, Canva is super easy to use: it has free templates, and they’re all ready-made with pre-made designs so I don’t have to be a graphic artist to use it. Most of Canva’s templates are free and customizable as well. So, if I want to add some more flair or background colors to make it more personal, then I can do that too. I recommend you to use Canva."
"it is an excellent graphic design tool that provides a user-friendly interface for creating beautiful designs. It offers a wide range of templates, images, and fonts, making it easy for users to create professional-looking graphics without any prior design experience. Canva also has a vast library of stock photos and icons that users can use to enhance their designs."
"i love this app so much! i use it at school, home, anywhere. its awesome but when i try to use a PRO sticker, it always has a water mark and some of the free ones aren't that good. ive made lots of canvas and some are really pretty only the PRO stickers is all i can really complain about lol!"
"Very good app, I personally use this and recommend to my friends. Mainly it's pre created themes help me a lot. But the reason for giving 4 stars is that, It carshes sometimes. But I hope that this problem will be resolved by next update."
"I really like this app so I gave it a 4 star because aside from the fact that it offers a lot of free templates and whatnots it also had a great customer service. I didn't gave it a five star because it took too much time to save your projects and the like. On the other hand, I'm really looking forward for an offline canva app."
Easy to use. Innumerable templates. I'd just like to see a liiiittle more racial diversity when I search for images. Really great to use. I've been subscribed for about 2 years and I cannot go without it.
"This app is easy to use. When I first used this app, I was a little annoyed with it With the download option. But later it became very easy to use. Thanks to the developer group for making it so easy. If there is no picture coming with the pixel size, please fix it .."
Hi team loving the app with its new dimensions with ai. But a bit of disappointment came along bcz from the last update the quality of the content after downloading especially the text is not upto the mark. It's not crisp like it used to be . Cannot share such blurry media ..please look into that
"Canva is the absolute best!! Periodt!! So beginner friendly with lots of features I'm just giving a four stare cause sometimes, I'd save my design, then click on another app to compare something, then boom, my last progress reverts back. Pls guys, work on that."
"A great 👍 app. A great volume of top quality templates, user-friendly interface. Really helpful. But however, nowadays when I download my work and try to use it, it says in the other app ""File not supported"". Try fixing it"
Very good designing app to work upon the Mobile phone. There should be a customer feedback pop up after downloading each design so that the user can convey and give the challenges or freshly experience details faced while using the App 👍 to the (Canva Development Team) coz users don't remember many glitches experienced after sometime has passed.
"It is indeed a great designing app but i suggest to add more designs and i also suggest on adding stickers they're going to be well used. What i mean by stickers, on something like expressions. Also i suggest on the home page are appearing based on our type, like our recently used, based on that more of our recently used will appear on the homepage and on the sections, i suggest you show the most popular design used to make it more interesting, other than that it's really great i recommend it..."
"Everything Good , UI is Good , All things worked fine for me , But at the last when I went ahead to download my work , it was not downloading , It's taking a hell lot of time :) , please fix the issue This Problem got fixed automatically Don't know how , but yeah ...!!! Great App Good Work Canva Team"
Very useful for combining picture and editing them. Also it can assis on your picture placement and sort or place them neatly. I give it a four star because I don't think I can turn off the assis for more complex picture design.
"Been using canva since pandemic. It's cool that I can easily edit anything here, but things lately seems slow. I do have stable internet connection but it take long to reload unlike before. Hope it will be fix."
I will rate this app 4 stars. Such a great app for creative minded people . But I face a simple issue regarding using different colours in a sentence. Can someone please guide me to use different text colours in a single text(sentence)
"Overall, the app is great and the functions are instinctive. You can immediately use it and be somewhat decent at making things. It's just that when i was trying to adjust the shape that was behind another shape, it got a bit difficult to manage. It was also quite difficult to move everything in one go since you needed to click the ""multiple times"" button or something to choose what shapes,text boxes or frames to move. It got annoying but it got the job done."
Great little app for social posts and the like. The integration of paid elements into all the templates can be frustrating unless you're happy to build your own from scratch.
"A very underrated editing app. It's very useful in creating wallpapers, inspirational posters,flyers etc.. it's very simple and easy to edit in Canva."
"I've recently started using Canva and love it! It's allowed me to create many videos and cards to capture and share memories. One improvement I'd love to see is if it could consume less battery, I use a galaxy fold 4 and Canva is appearing as one of the top apps draining the battery."
"This app is the best app for editing, however there r some payments u have to make just for using templates. All the good templates are the ones that u have to pay for, and u also have to pay for some effects, handwriting and more stuffs!"
There is no way to assign data when we use bulk create feature. Elements are to be right clicked to assign data. But there is no way to right click on the mobile app.
"As others have stated, VERY buggy as of late. I recall awhile back, the app's developers had... quote ""taken steps to improve the launch times of the app"". However... after seeing how many times I've had to CLOSE AND REOPEN THE APP just to make it WORK PROPERLY... I'd rather go back to the super long startup time! Please consider this! The ""need for speed"" has caused the reply function to break, channels to not load/freeze, and messages to be sent with incorrect formatting/unexpected newlines!"
"rating this up a few stars more because i have figured out how to fix it - a simple phone restart did the job quickly, and got my voice calls back up and working - people could hear me, and i could hear them. the only big thing that’s keeping me from making it a five-star review is the way it lags and crashes - it may be my internet occasionally, but i know for a fact my internet is not always that bad. other than that, it’s an amazing app for voice calls, chatting with friends and just - fun!!"
"App is good for communicating with my friends that are far distances, but the app crashes sometimes. Second, the controls for the call like where the mut button supposed to be and whatever gets blacked out and I had to delete the game and download it again. Third, pretty much the app glitches a lot, PLEAAASE fix these issues. Have a nice day! Edit: Ok, reinstalling the app helped, thanks for the advice!"
"Just today I've been having issues with the in call volume, I can't control it from my phones volume buttons anymore unless I mute and unmute over and over while changing the volume. Even then it's not as loud as it used to be. It also makes the connecting to the channel noise without it actual disconnecting and reconnecting. I'll still be in the voice channel with a good connection and it'll keep making the joining sound :/"
"Great app, but I've been having issues lately of my phone not receiving notifications as well as not being able to send DMs. I can send them from the desktop app, and see those messages appear in real time, but my phone will not send them. The app has been kept up to date."
"Crashing everytime I open it, even after restarting. Just since updating yesterday. Edit: several support tickets were submitted. I was able to resolve by holding down the Discord icon (intending to uninstall), and clicked on a message link that opened Discord to a different channel. It appears the channel I was in waa causing the crash. Trying it again now... Yep, that channel or server, can't tell."
I think discord is wonderful for how it is. Great for chatting with friends and servers you share interests with. The only problem I have is out of nowhere I stopped receiving notifications from just a few people who I used to receive from just fine. I can't seem to solve it no matter what I do. They aren't muted and nothings in my settings. I receive pop up notifications while out of the app from everyone else besides those few people.
"I like some of the UI changes that the new update added, but overall performance has suffered. It does not feel smooth and frame drops are noticeable when navigating throughout the app. My Galaxy S21+ doesn't ever stutter with anything else I do, and I don't think it makes sense for a chat app to be the one that has issues. I get that this is an initial release, but please focus on performance! If it runs poorly on my phone, I can't imagine what it's like on lower-end devices!"
"Update: Small news?? It runs much smoother than it has in awhile. I was able to call without any issues, send photos! Prev: A jumbled mess now, honestly. If multiple people are having issues with the app, there's a problem with the app itself, not their wifi or anything else. Also, I hate the new update where it shows friend requests in the notifications part instead of where friends are. It's ridiculous. Please stop adding things and fix it first, I've never had issues with it until recently."
"Great for chatting with and making friends, the ability to make a server for free is great. The biggest problem for me it that if you are one to listen to music while in a call with your friends, you will soon hate it. The act of being in a call will distort all your music and can cause smart home devices connected to your spotify randomly pause. At the very best, the volume of the music will change randomly. Wish they would fix it, or make a way to change it."
"I've used this app for years and I've always thought the functions, easy to access messaging, and ability to connect with new people was great. However, when it comes down to the most recent updates I don't like how some settings get rebooted since it has caused me issues with talking on calls. I love the app overall, but I wish the team spent more time fixing bugs and whatnot to make it even more enjoyable."
"Hi there! I love the app, and I've been using it for years. However, there's one issue that I've recently noticed. I myself, am on a Google Pixel 7 Android phone. Whenever I close a DM from a user on the on Discord on the phone, the app completely freezes. I have to close and then reopen it every single time I want to close a DM on discord. This also happens when I am leaving/joining a server, the app just completely freezes and does not respond till the app is closed and reopened again."
"Great for sending messages, and has a very good call function. Noise suppression for calls is impressive. I almost always eat really crunchy chips as I'm playing games with my friends, and they can never tell until I start talking. The things I would change/improve upon is the notifications. Sometimes notifications for messages do not appear, no matter phone or discord settings. As well as calls becoming more ""robotic"" occasionally, regardless of device, network connection, or duration of call."
"Really good app! It works like a charm, the only issue I have with it (And yes, just like previous users, I use a chromebook. It's a good chromebook though-) is whenever I'm in a call and I go onto (for example) google, the audio is all screwy and glitchy, and it takes forever to go back to normal, I actually opted for using the web version, which still worked kinda good, it is kind of hard to navigate on there though. The app is super good other than the calling issue I explained earlier."
"It may only be just me but since recent updates, my app has been extremely slow for a while. I can barely so anything without waiting a few minutes for a simple response from the app. It's extremely laggy, I rather choose other places and social media's to chat with people. Opening the app takes a long time, navigation takes a long time, texting also takes a long time, scrolling up and/or sending media also takes up a lot of time. I've restartee my device and uninstalled/reinstalled."
"Howdy, this is more of a bug report more than a review, but I have noticed on one of the servers I'm in, some channels in the information section are hidden, like announcements, rules, and others. But, these channels are visible in the Server Guide page. Additionally, it seems that sometimes opening that page will push random messages furthest left, where they tend to overlap with a user's name and profile picture. It can also occur when opening the app, I think. (EDIT: Solved the channel issue)"
"A few issues have been fixed such as the text zoom from what I have seen before the update but I still have express dissatisfaction. I would rate this 5 stars if it wasn't for the new Android update. It reset all my settings, the channels are way too close, and it is even more obvious who I have blocked has texted. Other than that, pretty cool. (Edit: I change this from 5 to 4 stars because of the new image UI. (Edit 2. Manually jump to messages. 3/5"
I honestly had this at a 5 stat rating but lately discord has been super bugging to the point of Uninstalling and reinstalling just to try and get it to run again. I've had whole servers go blank for hours just to appear out of thin air again. Several times it looks as if a server was deleted only for me to get it back. Or having to leave a server multiple times before it allowed me to actually Lea ve. Love the app just been super buggy
"The app is pretty good, but the one thing that bugs me is that when I made a account and used my email, I deleted the app for a couple weeks. Then I downloaded it again and used my enail to make another account, but it didnt let me use the email again. And the thing is, that I never rlly thought about saving the password on my other account for it to happen like this. Pretty good app after all, but I think you be able to use ur email or phone nu.ber more than once."
"Back at it again with a new problem, this time regarding two different topics. Sometimes, going back in channel history too far will cause a JSON Error that then prevents me from viewing any other channels, and I have to completely close the app to fix it. Secondly, for some odd reason, after the most recent update, joining a Voice Channel while connected to Wi-Fi will prevent me from hearing others, and others from hearing me, acting as if I'm disconnected or RTC connecting."
"I think the app itself is amazing! The updates are unexpected and sometimes unnecessary, but overall, great updates when they happen. But the moderation over people's conversations and what they do is very concerning. The app allows people to get in lots of trouble and cause problems for the people. This app is great, though! I've met my best friends there and keep up with others!"
"It has been a few days, but discord on mobile closes everytime I open and try to check something. Desktop works fine. Updates haven't fixed the issue. ETA: I left a few servers and that seemed to fix the issue, maybe I was in too many? The app was stuck in a friend's channel every time I tried to check a different channel the app shut down. Readjusted my score, but unsure if I should reenter the one server."
"Images/gifs are horrendously cropped and compressed (I have full nitro, it shouldn't be compressed!), editing channels, viewing profiles or editing messages are scaled down to a window so tiny you can't even see what your clicking on or reading channels disappear halfway while scrolling. I could keep listening problems but I'm hitting the character limit. It's unusable. Edit: They fixed it, but you guys should not push broken updates without checking first, that's why PTB and canary exists."
"Discord is great. Great UI, easy to navigate, pretty simple to figure out overall. A small gripe/suggestion is to have that when you block someone in a server or a group chat, to not show the promt that you want to see their message. If I blocked them, I don't want to see what they could be possibly saying about me. Small suggestion. Great app!"
"I LOVE this app. I have it on my phone and on desktop. However... for mobile this nost recent update has added a few... ""quirks"" in smaller servers im in some of the channels arent showing up or just ""blip"" in when scrolling down. And trying to reply to something brings up a really thin bar in the middle of my screen and no options to interact with it, it does however seem to scroll which is weird"
"On android, there is a bug which distorts pop-up windows and shared media. Pictures are displayed oversized rather than fitting the screen and profile windows are thinned out and elongated vertically like a strip banner. Usually updating fixes this but doesn't last long. I have uninstalled and reinstalled which also works, but not for long."
"I'm still pretty new at using the program and im finding it just a little bit difficult to navigate, tho i am a 40yr old mom who's not very technology literate. Other than that, other programs i use also use discord to navigate THEIR program, and in that sense it's very useful. My kids love it as well as they have a lot of friends that use the app."
"Would give five stars if it weren't for the fact that most of the things you can do require IOS or or a Laptop/PC, Like server boosting, (some thing that allows you to change the background colors or something?) And Nitro Managing, maybe my phone doesn't work with it? But it's a problem when I can't cancel a subscription (I had a problem with someone and their card auto renewing) all I'm saying is the lack of ability to use all of the features (Which I know will eventually happen) Is a problem"
"The app was fine as is, and the introduction to Activities on Mobile was a great idea, but the slide-to-reply feature is incredibly useless. I want to swipe left to see who is online, not to reply to someone. Some other features are also a bit unoptimised, such as voice channels, which no longer detect my input."
"This is a great app.There are a few things I've run into. It's slow to load if you use the windows client, for some reason the pop-up dialog (long press on a message to react or reply) is unusable sometimes so it needs to be restarted, now you can close a DM but it freezes my app, when I go to select an emoji I can't select a sub-group on the bottom (it just places the emoji that's behind whatever sub-set I tap) Aside from that it's great at what it's for"
"I use Discord a lot in general, and being able to spread the media that I make around a huge community is extremely helpful for me. It's also perfect for hopping on a video game with some people that are interested in the same stuff you are. Now the mobile version of Discord is a bit buggy, with it sometimes not wanting to connect with the servers and occasionally not playing videos unless you restart it, but all in all, it is an app that I would definitely recommend getting."
"Its a very great app overall! (Don't mind why I am called the acc I am.) But theres a few problems I'm having. For some reason, none of the gifs or pictures I put into the thing don't load or overall appear. It just becomes a blank space until after a long period of time it appears finnaly. Plus, maybe add an option to turn off the fast reply feature please? Too use to sliding left to see the server list. Hope this makes sense-🧍"
"Its a really amazing app, but for some reason, the actual interface n stuff keeps getting worse with every update (mostly because I think its trying to become like Apple Discord, which sucks). A few updates ago, I could change where channels were with no problem. Now? The entire app glitches and its impossible to change a channel's placement without causing a channel earthquake and screwing everything up. Its seriously annoying. Besides that epic app"
"Edit 3: It's getting better! Instead of crashing the moment I open it, it actually loads a page! Unfortunately it crashes if I change servers or try to send a message. But it's progress! Keep at it, y'all will fix it sooner or later. (And no, it's not my WiFi or phone.)"
"This is one of the best AI imaging apps. Easy to use, imaginative and high quality images. Could be a bit more easy to use without seperare chats and a file storage section. Also, I would like to see more diverse images for BIPOC. Overall, great app that keeps improving."
"I like that I conversations with friends, it's easy to navigate once you figure it out. I dislike threads disappearing when they are inactive. I'd like to be able to choose if they disappear or not. Overall it has been a good alternative to other social media that gets inundated with garbage."
"Discord is a pretty good app to have communication. You can customize your profile picture with a background color and put a short little biography to describe yourself! The only problem I have is that on mobile it sometimes glitches and all of the gcs and private dms will all have the same thing on the screen. Besides that, the app is overall pretty good!"
"Its great, been using it for years. But recently its gotten just a little buggy, deleting text messages, images. Unfriending people at random, muting or closing dm's, kicking from calls a few times in a row before letting me stay. But im still going to use it, because I think its only temporary bugs, I love the app, its the only way to talk to my friends."
"Encountered a strange bug where closing a DM will not let you do or interact with ANYTHING else after, and is temporarily fixed by closing and reopening. Small, but annoying, like a fly that keeps buzzing around and you can't smack it. Other than that, my only gripe is the very small file size limit compared to upgraded size limits. Beyond those, though, it's a great app, would recommend 👍👍"
"Discord is a really amazing app, and I arguably spend most of my time on the app. I've gotten only minor issues where every time I switched a server, the server I was previously on would come out, but that's avoidable if you can click on a channel to the server you just clicked on. Another minor issue is I can't tell if a message is bold or not. Again, only minor, but regardless. The app is amazing. Would recommend 100%"
"It's a great app, but lately, there's been some issues. New DMs wouldn't show on the app and be sent through my phone's notifications as if I weren't already on the app. I have been closing out the app and returning to fix this issue on my own. However, it will come back later. Lastly, the custom status emoji is not the regular Discord Emoji and goes out of frame. This just bothers me."
"Took a little getting used to, but works well for text and image chatting! Wish I could send videos at all; you can't with the free version. The video chatting/streaming have about an 80% success rate when it comes to audio/video quality (or audio and video lining up). But it's a nice way to have everything on the same platform! It was especially useful during the pandemic - my organization could chat internally, advertise virtual events, and host those events all on the same Discord server."
"Been using Discord for close to 3 years now, overall haven't had any major issues! It's been a great app over both mobile and desktop, but recently I've started to notice more mobile bugs as I've been stuck on mobile for a while now. Camera freezing during video calls after leaving the call-only screen, app constantly crashing in the background of other apps, quite a fair bit of lagginess, and the rest are all personal issues I have with app choices. But other than that, great app!"
"As an Xbox user, I'm pretty excited about the voice transfer feature as it makes it a ton easier to communicate with my PC friends. But as a Twitch streamer, I have a pretty major complaint. I can't really stream on Twitch with my PC friends as Discord doesn't allow any of them to enable their audio to the stream. With the amount of cross-platform games there are nowadays, I really think this should have been considered. I know this feature isn't fully developed, but I hope to see it fixed."
"New update is horrible. The new ui is annoying, but I can live with it. What bothers me are the constant performance issues. Messages, videos, and user profiles all take much longer to load, and it's not wifi related as I've tested this on multiple connections. Also, I wish there was an option to turn off vibrations. The new vibrations don't make discord any more pleasant to navigate, they just kinda throw me off."
"Quite a lovely application, I dig it a lot. The only issue I've come across is that the mobile version of discord defaults calls to phone call mode instead of treating it like media, which degrades the sound quality of music bots and individuals substantially. I dunno if you'll plan on fixing this in a future update, but it'd be sick if you gave it some consideration. Thanks."
"It's not the easiest app to get all set up or teach to others but I was able to wrangle the whole family onto it and now we can all text/video/screen share despite half of us being Apple and half of us being Android. It is very reliable and the video connection is the best I've found for this purpose. My main gripe re: discord is not being able to assign different DMs different audio notifications. Unless I've missed it, it's not possible on the free version."
"Discord is a very nice app and I've used it for year but it has one small problem. It has a little feature that sometimes pops up in new channels that says ""done reading, check out a different channel"" when this happens you can't type in the channel your in, and no matter what you do you can't seem to get rid of it. I find it quite annoying, and i would like it to be removed. Everything else however is fine."
"Good app overall, the only issues are how laggy it can get sometimes. Sometimes it gets so buggy that if you try to mute yourself or leave the call, or just press anything whatsoever nothing seems to happen at all. Great app I would recommend if you want to keep in touch with friends in a better way, just watch out for bugs if your on a lower end, or entry-level device."
"Great app. One suggestion though: On mobile, ""Do Not Disturb"" is basically pointless. I still get notifications when it's enabled, and it's just really distracting when I need to focus. A number of times I got so fed up I uninstalled it just to stop the notifications. I know I can change it in my phone settings, but I don't want to go there each time I want to turn notifications on and off, so if ""Do Not Disturb"" could just work as intended, I think that would be better for everyone."
"This is my favorite app. I'm moving to Discord from Facebook as my primary social media platform. I'd rate the Discord app five stars instead of four were it not for connection issues. Often, when I open the app, it'll perpetually attempt to connect. Sometimes it connects after a minute or so, and other times I have to restart the app to get it to work. Disconnecting from the Wi-Fi network helps, but at that point I'm burning through my data. That's my only complaint. 🙂"
"discord has been an amazing way to get together with friends, and has consistently stayed pretty good overall. the only issues i have with it, are that streaming on mobile consistently doesn't have audio regardless of settings and what i stream to. it's not just an issue on my end either, as my friends have also had this same thing happen to them. aside from that, it's an amazing app to use and have fun with in any regard"
"So there is an issue with your volume slider in private calls. Ever since the latest UI update the volume slider has become so tiny that I cannot use it without some random luck of my finger hitting the slider. Since my phone won't turn people I talk to all the way, sometimes I need to use the slider to turn them down more, but I can't do that if I can't touch it right away. Let alone if I do turn them down it's a pain to turn back up. Other than that the app has been great."
"Well, it doesn't work anymore. It opens and I see stuff, but clicking on things doesn't have any effect. Edit: I removed and reinstalled it, but it does the same thing. This is on a Samsung S6 tablet with 6GB RAM, 128GB storage. EDIT: One star to four... The problem is that some of the interface doesn't work when I am using the mouse on a tablet (which I nearly always am). It works with touch, just not with the mouse. If you all could fix that, I could bump that rating up one more star..."
"I've used this app for years now, and there's never been a single problem with it until recently. Recently, whenever I try to send a file, it automatically compresses, I've gone to setting to turn this off but it doesn't work. I normally compress oversized files on a separate website, considering I don't want nitro. But now, whenever it gets automatically compressed by discord (even when it's below 7-8mb) it increases the amount of memory it takes, instead of decreasing?? Please fix this soon."
"Good app, but a lot of my messages don't send when it says ""connecting"". Which sucks because I usually reply from the notification tray while browsing another app and won't realize if it sent or not unless I open the app. Even then, it can take several minutes or more for it to finally connect. Sometimes a message I sent will go through later, but most of the time it's just lost in the void."
"Ive been finding a few bugs with the app, one with DMs, where a few of my texts have either disappeared or been merged with the recipient, and the second with the notification bar, where most of my messages will refuse to send, if sent from there, and the third, really bad connection issues. Each time I reopen the app, it will not load recent messages, or channels, because it will be stuck on ""Connecting""."
"The app is an excellent means to communicate with multiple communities, as well as to organize said communities by niche. My only problems with it are some more recent changes that make some things more difficult to use on mobile, such as the new pinned messaging process or whatever process controls videos. Videos bug out very often, forcing me to restart the app and even that doesn't always fix it. Other than that and some aesthetic displeasure, I am very fond of the Discord app."
"I appreciate the bugs that have been fixed and the features that have been added back to the app since the August 2022 update, such as emote names turning blue again and, most recently, the timestamps reappearing for messages more than two days old. However, I have encountered a new bug. Whenever I type two regional indicator emotes back to back, no spaces, the app auto-replaces it with a flag emote. This is incredibly inconvenient for me, and I wish it was re-evaluated and fixed!"
"This app genuinely does help with meeting knew people, I even have very close friends because of this app that I would've never met. It also is a very helpful aid with more serious stuff, like for school. Overall, I haven't had really any bad experiences with this app and I would recommend if you're already in a constant state of depression But one issue I do have is that images don't send quickly. It's taking me 1-3 minutes for a single image to send and most the time the image size is small"
"After looking through the app and testing to see if there are anymore bugs that have hindered my experience while using the app, I can say that the updates have changed a lot. I think the app is pretty good where it's at and I hope it can keep getting better. Also I see that the issue with discord not conforming to the aspect ratio of my app window has been fixed which is great."
"This app is excellent for shared interests. It has very clever bots too. But I sometimes spend way too much time finding messages for me in a channel. I'm told i have two messages but it's not easy for me to find them quickly. Also, replying doesn't seem to work consistently; sometimes it creates a little trail, sometimes there's no trail."
"I'm not really worried much about the bugs, but I do have one complaint. When going to watch videos posted in chats, after a few seconds the videos don't want to play, and I cant click to make them play. Another issue, not a bug, is the pinned messages limit in DMs. Why? it's super low and with the fact I talk a lot with people, I can't pin the messages after a certain point. My suggestion is maybe raise the limit or not have one."
"So I'm not sure on whose end it is, but when I start playing music on Spotify and then go into Discord, it stops the music entirely. I pause, skip the song, go back to the previous one, move ahead in the song, silence. The play bar doesn't even move at all. I even tried a different playlist, still the same. And both apps are fully updated."
"Was great for a time, but now I can't use my google photos or image gallery to send pictures to my friends, now I have to scroll through the file app to find what I want to send them, which is a complete mess. Imo, should've stayed the way it was. Edit: Issued solved for months, the application bugs out at times, but nothing is perfect. Does the job well!"
"A good service that I've used for years and enjoyed. But it loses a star since hardware keyboard support has gotten much worse recently. There are no options for keybinds in the mobile app, and the desktop keyboard shortcuts don't work even if you have an external keyboard attached. But the worst part is that hitting Enter no longer sends messages, but makes new lines. You have to use Ctrl+Enter for every single message, which makes Discord really unpleasant to use that way."
"It's really great! However, I do want to point out a glitch that a ton of people are having. There's a bug in which you can try moving or rearranging a role, and it will not go where you want it to and may be wayy higher or wayy lower than you want it to. It also has a chance to shuffle the entire list if you aren't careful with it. You basically are forced to play a guessing game when it comes to rearranging the roles, and you have to hope to god it was placed in the right position. Please fix"
"Pretty good! I like all the server features, bots, and custom emojis- it's all really nice. Right now, though, I'm dealing with a glitch that won't let me send photos. It just shows an error whenever I send one. I updated the app, thinking that would help, but so far, nope."
"I have used Discord for more than five years on PC, and I downloaded the app to stay connected with my friends and servers. The only issue is despite having a strong connection, sometimes my messages don't send, and there is a ""connecting"" banner on the top of the screen. Otherwise, I have no problems with the Discord app."
"Overall Discord is a great service, my go-to app for communicating with others. Only issues are occasional lag and connection issues for international voice calls, especially when we are sharing videos on shared screen. But this doesn't ruin the experience for me. Overall, I love Discord and the friends I have made on it."
"Look, it is a great app. But ever since a few updates ago the performance has been absolutely awful. Even just opening your files to send lags everything at an unusable scale. It could be because I just don't have the best phone, but it worked fine before. The UI changes were annoying but I could live with it. It completely butcheted all performance. However despite all of this, there is not really a greater messaging app than discord. Recommended, but please fix performance issues."
"I have been using discord for a while now, AND THE APP IS AMAZING! I get to join servers from around the world, text friends, creat servers, and more! But I have one problem, when ever I'm on phone or tablet, I never get to upload pictures, the run very slow, and I just see this to be a huge problem to me, whenever I'm on computer all the photos and pictures load in great."
"There's a weird glitch going on, I try to reply with the notification bubble. When I hit reply, it loads like normal, but the message doesn't go through, at all. The only way I can reply is opening the app, itself. It's a bit of a pain to do, constantly opening the app just to reply to a message, where I can just easily reply from the notification bubble. I've uninstalled the app and I restarted my phone, and nothing worked. Hope this gets fixed, soon."
"I love discord, honestly. I use it for everything and for the most part, it's pretty great. However, my complaint, as of recently is when I am in video calls, the video just freezes up for the other parties or has a loading symbol. I'm not sure if I'm the only one or not but it happens on both of my mobile devices. :( Hopefully, there's a fix soon?"
"I really don't have anything to say bad about it... I wish it was easier to understand how to navigate it - I'm apart of a medical discord and I like to save a ton of reference material but it's not all pinned to one place - this needs to happen! It's really my only complaint. I'm still learning but I enjoy the clubs I'm in so for now, it gets 4 stars until they add the feature I need most!"
"I can't believe it, but Discord seems to be bug-free and enjoyable to use again! My main complaint is that not enough time seems to be spent in beta finding bugs - with each update I have to gamble on whether Discord will still be usable. While I appreciate the new features added in each update, the fact that they come with a plethora of bugs makes me less willing to update the app on a regular basis. However, this app remains my preferred method of communication with friends and fellow gamers."
"The app is really good! The bugs I've had problems with have mostly been solved but now I'm noticing a strange bug where it seems to freeze whenever I try to post images, or atleast take much longer than usual. I am not sure if its just a problem from my phone in general or otherwise, I would like to have that checked either way."
"Overall an awesome app but has issues with mobile devices particularly. The desktop app has few issues. However the mobile app, especially when connected to mobile data, simply refuses to connect to the internet sometimes. I have spent upwards of 40 minutes troubleshooting it and trying to get it working, to no avail. Please fix these connection issues."
Fantastic app. Although since an update in August (not sure on that) the app has become very slow and is always struggling to send messages and connect. I would love it and many others would love it if this got fixed. It feels unusable at times. This is just for the android version though.
"I had an issue with discord being unusable, it would either be stuck on the loading screen or it would open to close a genuine 5 seconds later, I was barely able to read my messages lead alone send them. But, this appears to have been an issue with my device as when I uninstalled it and reinstalled it after powering off my device, it was fixed. Overall a great app 10/10 would recommend"
"It's good although a new bug I've noticed is that sometimes when you click on a server, pulling over to see the channel list shows my active dm and chats list instead. Sometimes when I'm in a dm, click onto the server, the chat stays no matter what channel I click on so I end up having to restart the app to make it go away, that is if it does."
"Discord has always been my favorite app to chat on but more and more the mobile app becomes harder to use. The updates make the app lag, drain battery, and require more service than usual. The new features are awesome but channels don't load, my friends messages dont come through until a minute after they are sent, and many other issues. Hopefully this can be resolved?"
"Hello Discord Staff, Happy (late) New Years and hope y'all having a good day. I came to report an issue/bug I've been experiencing and I'm not sure if it's only happening to me or to others but, here it is: this new update, when I'm not on the app, and I received messages from friends, and I replied back.. The issue is the message looks like it gets send but it doesn't actually go through the message bubble and I always have to be on the app just to send a message. Hopefully that made sense, thx"
"Edit: The second issue has been fixed! (Had to remove due to character limit) Unfortunately the first issue still is an issue though. I really love the app, but unfortunately it can be really buggy especially when editing messages. The screen will not let me scroll up or down and I have to switch chatrooms to fix it."
"Discord is amazing if you want to talk to others and do smaller roleplays, it's great until you need to upload a larger file or voice call. The calling functions need a lot of work they're glitchy and have horrible quality. Overall a great app, that isn't as pay to use as others. It's great unless your intentions are to write full stories or longer conversations."
"This app is pretty great! It's just that it can sometimes be VERY inconsistent, and the gui bugs out a lot. Sometimes the app stops working for no good reason, sometimes it's not even an update, I just have to UNINSTALL and REINSTALL! Which is *very* annoying, just sayin'. So please, fix this app's performance issues and gui inconsistencies! Love ya!"
I have been using this off and on for a few years and it is very useful. Switching between the PC version and the phone version get confusing at times but it is not that bad. The thing I do have issues with is the ads sometimes block the bottom part of content which is more annoying than anything. I can eventually see it but it is annoying.
"2023 Jan - the new update has fixed the video sending options and the file compression. Changed rev to a 4* due to other random glitches of the app closing or audio being bad. 2020: File compression breaks all forms of media. Videos have nothing but static for sound and images are solid black. The compression breaks all forms of media sharing. Apparently this only happens on some devices, unluckily mine is one of them. This was a 5 Star review, I'll leave it as a 1 until this is fixed honestly."
"I love this app. I've made plenty of friends on the app. The app right now is buggy where it's taking a lot longer to see text messages than before. The app would disconnect me from call without me telling it too. The app wasn't like this few weeks ago. Now I just want the app to update and stop acting like this. I uninstall and reinstall, still same issues."
"Great app, use it all the time with my friends. However, if im playing a game or just scrolling through itll either crash or be extremely slow and also kick me out of vc. Audio quality can also be improved, and i think a setting to automatically change your server profile nickname when you join a new server would be nice."
"Had Discord since 2016, love it to bits. Although I will forever miss animated emojis being free for all accounts, nitro classic ain't too expensive at about $10/m. However, lately I've been crashing constantly on startup with the mobile app. I've restarted my phone, and uninstalled/reinstalled but the issue persists."
"2/13/23: Channels seem to be showing up fine. The only ""qualm"" I have now is why you can't set unique statuses for individual servers. Surely that is something that can be implemented in the future? 11/20/2022: This is an ongoing issue despite numerous updates: servers do not show all their channels. That is a major problem. Especially if Discord is used for work communications."
"After the last update the Android speech to text will not work. It opens up and then shuts down immediately. And then I will upload a video that is 6-7 MB, it will show that, and then it will tell me that I can't upload anything bigger than 8 MB. Until this is fixed my ratings going to be two stars. UPDATE: after the latest update I am able to upload videos again. The speech to talk is still sketchy but it is better than it was."
"It's an amazing app Been using it for years and won't stop anytime soon although with the new updates for server creation on mobile I believe that it has been downgraded, especially so for the way you reorder channels, it used to be smooth and now it's choppy and hard to predict, but other than that I don't have any valid complaints"
"The only reason that I gave it a four star is that the new Discord updates don't run well on older devices anymore, either it keeps closing the app, the app crashes, or you can't send messages properly. Other than that, it's a good way to chat with friends or make new friends along with chatting with other people."
"Everything works pretty well! I haven't had any problems in voice calls and I can talk to my friends easily. Though when they or I send a video, I can't hear the audio; so I have to download the video and then I can hear the audio. I've checked my settings multiple times and my earbuds and speaker don't have anything wrong."
"Still a good app and everything but I have had no luck with a particular issue. When calling, there is a very loud noise, that goes off when I or someone else joins/leaves the call, or I mute/deafen, and that I cant turn off. I have tried every fix I can find online and in the app, but Nothing has fixed the issue, and it's become an issue in real life for me. I have to be able to deafen/mute silently. Ever since the update in August, it's been a problem, and I need to know how to resolve this."
"Been using the app since 2020, I like the new features and the fact you can send recordings. But I'm hoping the performance of the app is improved. I thought it was my old phone being slow and since I got a new one. It's the same. It does sometimes crash, lagging alot and sometimes my friends list don't appear. Overall, its okay. Just the lag and crashing must stop 💙"
Mono audio on mobile device. Which is irritating while listening to music on voice channel. Previously there was a option to change it but now there isn't. Takes some time to connect on mobile app. It shows connecting... Its for few minutes but when you are opening in hurry it's feels irritating. No issues in desktop app.
"There is a bug when clicking someone's profile the pop up window is a rectangle and you can't see anything rendering it useless, please fix. Update: I reinstalled the app and that seemed to fix it but my friend invited me to a server and When I open the app now it opens to the invite to the server even if I'm already a member. A 2nd reinstall resolved the issue. 1 star off for the bugs. Thanks for the response from the team."
"Versatile Fitness App 🏋🏻‍♀️🍎 It is enhanced with a variety of features for food diary, barcode scanner, fitness tracking, Bluetooth notifications, personal health/medical data record, and much more. It really does help with setting healthy lifestyle goals. Plus, it's easy to navigate through and set up. I'm only using the free version and it has been a very satisfactory journey. It is a product and brand that can be independently trusted."
Overall good. It's hard to find where to change things if it's not setup how you want. Trouble shooting issues isn't too hard though. The lamest part is when I updated to version 32.72.1.23. It tells me EVERY TIME I open the app to set up phone notifications: I DON'T WANT TO because I HATE notifications. I tried to trick it by turning them on and then turning them off but that didn't work. Make it stop!!!!!
"In general, the app is good. I only have issues every now and then. First issue, it seems to freak out when network connectivity gets a little wonky. So, for instance, if you are in the middle of going from WiFi to cellular, the app just gives you a blank screen and you have to kill it for it to work again. Other issue, it doesn't update the screen widget often and accurately. For a Google product, on a Google OS on a Google device, I would expect the widget to work, but most days it doesn't."
"They recently updated the app and it's like a massive downgrade. They claim the changes increase readability, but making all the backgrounds white makes it boring and frankly harder to read. It makes it look like any other basic app. You can also no longer make the displays full screen. The weight tracking chart is impossible to read now. Very, very poorly designed ""update"""
"App is user friendly and allows quick access to the categories I check the most. I don't use the food log. I wish there were more options for mindfulness in the standard package; most are for premium. My community - friends easily complete challenges and I find the blog articles helpful. Overall my app works fine, it is easy to add a device, when I upgrade. I have used Fitbit for 9 years."
"Pretty good app that goes along with your Fitbit, or you can use it without if you use the phone step counter or MobileTrack. Handy for tracking calorie intake. Social media features have recently been cut back. Some of them still work. Pretty stable app but some things are quirks that never seem to get fixed, such as the miles per day goal expecting kilometers or something."
"Works great and I'm using the food log feature a lot more. The sleep feature disappoints me sometimes. Some nights I don't sleep well at all and it'll say I had 9 hours of sleep! I don't think it's that accurate. It also keeps recording exercise that says I was swimming when I wasn't. I was folding laundry one day and it registered it as swimming. 🤷‍♀️ Other than that, it's helped me on my path to wellness."
I don't agree that the white background has made the charts easier to read and the new fonts are definitely not friendly to older eyes. I record my weight daily and appreciated the old version chart enabled a 365 day view in the 1 year view as opposed to a calendar year view. By simpley scrolling left or right the chart adjusted the dates to whatever 365 day period you want.
"I've had my fitbit versa for about 4.5 years, and my experience has been positive. I set alot of reminders, use timers when exercising, or cooking, set alarms, see text( responses are limited but suffice, until I get to my phone, log foods, and track macros, and check weather. I also use some of the other logging features, water and sleep. I don't know how accurate sleep monitoring is but it gives me an idea of number of hours of sleep especially when I have nights of interrupted sleep."
I use Fitbit for a variety of tools. The primary one is the steps. It's great because the app automatically updates as I am walking. I have also started to use the Sleep function. Knowing how well I sleep allows me to change that behavior for the better. I also like the Badges that are given when I reach a milestone.
"After finally fixing the bug thst caused the account to be logged out (over a year to get that right) the app was very good basic trackerof exercise and sleep. Over the past year the app has become an advertisement for fitbit premium subscription. I tried the subscription for the extended sleep information. That works well. With google cutting back features on fitbit recently, it looks like it may be another victim of useful and liked products that google kills."
"My Charge 5 is an update model for me and is a great improvement.. especially like the new easy to read screen in any lighting scenario. Not sure how to stop my e mails from appearing on screen. The cardio tracking is great, no EKG but does indicate if a Defib occurred. The sleep scale and exercise (walking) tracking seems. accurate"
"I've enjoyed using the Fitbit app for about 5 years, to help me stay motivated for long-term fitness goals, like everyday strength, endurance and mobility as I age. Recently, the app changed, and I can no longer adjust the intensity of the workout when I enter an otherwise unrecognized activity, like weight training. This is somewhat annoying. Be aware: Fitbit is mostly a pedometer. It isn't designed to track other critically important activities."
"Amazing fitness app minus one feature. The calorie counter for food is inaccurate. It has a nice feature where you can scan barcodes for food. However, a lot of these are not accurate. The package will say for example 90 calories per bar but Fitbit will have it in their database as 60. It's very annoying having to adjust the serving size to be accurate."
"4.75🌟 I mostly love this wearable & app combo because it tracks so may parts of overall fitness health, which makes it easy to stay motivated. Most of it works well & is very intuitive. The main reason I didn't give it 5🌟 is because a couple of features are either difficult to find/remember where they are or aren't easy to modify on the fly. Also, sometimes it doesn't record a component (usually the distance or the pace) on my run, but I haven't ruled out user error for that yet. 👟☺"
"The app is a good one that helps keep me on track with my fitness goals, eating habits, and water intake. However, the app doesn't seem very friendly to us swing/ night shift people who have a different eating, sleeping, and working out pattern than someone with a traditional 9 to 5. It's a little inconvenient to have to go back into the app, and add in my dinner and anything else that occurred after the reset at 12am just to make sure everything was added."
"Fitbit App as a fitness and health tracker coupled with the Inspire 3 has been a good experience so far. There are some syncing issues here and there, overall, not enough to impact the experience in a negative way. I have been sleeping better and finding it easier to track my goals and complete them in a manner that is productive and in line with my personalized needs. Data that drives your fitness and health goals to the next level!"
"Impressive amount of information is provided on the app, but it's only as good as the data that's synced from the device. When I workout, most of the time there's a large discrepancy between my actual heart rate and the rate displayed on my Versa 3. Often, the Versa 3 lags by 20-30 bpm. I've tried wearing the device tighter, looser, wiping off sweat, not wiping off sweat, moving it up on my wrist, and moving it down. I haven't found anything that improves recording."
"In past few months, I have trouble with it synching. I've turned it on , off tried different things. Now it's saying it doesn't have enough data to measure my sleep data. I may need to upgrade to a better watch but may check out other than Fitbit types. It seems to track steps just fine."
Update...still have my Versa 3 and I am loving it. It seems like ever since Premium became available I have been having issues receiving text/phone notifications. They are either very delayed or don't go through. I have to restart my device several times. I don't have the premium and I don't want it. I just feel like there is a major delay. I have had the Versa for 18 months and it worked great up until a few months ago. Any suggestions?
"Functions as it should. One thing I'd prefer is that the search results had a hard and fast way to sort results, specifically Paid vs Free clock faces. Currently, it's a bit difficult to find something free after inputting a search tag. Otherwise it's fairly straightforward to use."
"It has a system for tracking workouts and saying how much time was spent in each heart rate zone, but there are only three zones; fat burning, cardio, and peak. Most systems use five zones. It lets you set a max and min heart rate which is good, most other systems will let you set one but not both. It sets the zones based on max heart rate. I'd rather have them based on heart rate reserve. Not perfect, but it's a good app and I'm going to keep using it."
"Update, I have been enjoying more of the features of my Fitbit. My favorite is still how it monitors and reports my sleep, but I occasionally can't find my phone and the""find my phone"" is helpful. The light from the face is very helpful when I get up at night and need to see my surroundings, it puts off enough light to keep me from tripping on a dog."
No syncing fixed My watch would not sync to my app for 4 or 5 weeks. Wrong time wrong date very frustrating finally found in settings on the watch a factory reset. My watch works again correctly! You do have to set up like you just got it and you have to re-add any apps you have on it. Can't believe it was that simple and I couldn't find this trick anywhere. I was considering tossing it in a drawer and getting the apple watch.
"I have a brand new Versa 4 and love the watch. It's awesome. The app worked great for a couple of days, but now the sleep cycle on my app doesn't sync. I have to log out of the app and log back in for it to sync. Other than that, it works great. But here's the problem, I'm one who reads reviews. This app has a ton of negative reviews, especially by users who pay for premium. I have 6 months of premium for free since my watch is new. If the app is this gitchy, I won't be paying for premium."
"Does pretty good but there are times that I walk for 90 minutes at a time and it claims 0 move zone. And have times when it won't count time on treadmill. Now after having the Fitbit for the second year , have had to have the pod replaced because it would not power up and the charger replaced because it wouldn't make good contact to the pod to charge it. Not to mention it take one to two MINUTES to get the phone and Fitbit to sync."
"The Fitbit Versa 2 has been very helpful with my fitness and with monitoring my heart rate. My only issue is that it will not measure my oxygen level while resting. And the battery does not last no more than about 2 days before needing to be charged. But overall, it is a good watch with a large variety of screen faces."
"Really appreciate the app, especially the premium features. I do especially use amd love the sleep feature so I can keep track in detail. However, a couple of things I would like the developers to know. Fitbit Aria scale will not sync when you are updating your Fitbit device to your app. Maybe there's no fixing this. Secondly, I am kindly requesting a dark theme option for the app since it's easier on my eyes. Thank you."
No longer receive text or email alert for low battery alert on my Charge 4. Other than that it works great. *** The Charge 4 band connection snaps off because it's plastic after aprox. 16 months. No warranty covers this so it's trash once that happens. Unfortunate because it's a great watch and should last more than a year and a half! OnePlus 7 Pro
"It doesn't count all of my stairs, but over counts my steps. Still I enjoy it very much!Overall, considering how very difficult it would be to totally translate all the jiggling and jarring throughout the day with 100 percent accuracy, I would say this a very useful and oft times inspiring tool for a 62 year old, anti technology guy. Mike, US NAVY retired"
"I like it but it's difficult to change the monthly period settings when it doesn't fall when predicted. It would be better to be able to edit by simply clicking the beginning and ending dates rather than dragging the dates. Many times it drags the dates way beyond what I want, especially if it falls on a Thursday to Monday or something."
"It's a pretty good app but one improvement would be w/some of the premium features. Specifically, the work out videos section. There is no way to search for specific workouts or types. The only options are little filters at the top that have limited choices. It would be nice to be able to search for specific instructors, types (mobility, core, legs, etc.), length, etc. Having this in the favorites area would be great as well. I also wish it indicated which workouts you've already completed."
"In general, the app is good. But: 1) it needs to connect to the internet to sync with the watch which makes it useless when out hiking, 2) it can be more clear that when recording an activity on the app, it is not going to import HR data from your device, and 3) it would be nice to be able to edit start and end times of a recorded activity later (because sometimes you just forget to stop recording)."
"I love my versa 2. It has turned me into a fitness nut. I track everything. I do wish the battery lasted longer, but I use it a lot, so that's probably why. Changing bands can be either easy or next to impossible, depending on what kind of band you buy. They should also include 2 of those little straps on the band to hold down the excess strap."
"Premium provides a lot of helpful data for tracking different aspects of health. Which is great. Just wish this app had a dark mode. I have light sensitivity and get migraines easily, and waking up in the morning to check my sleep tends to be frustrating. Especially in contrast to the rest of my phone which is always in dark mode too."
Great app! I've lost 10 lbs using this app so far. It's user interface is so easy to use. I will be buying the Fitbit Sense 2 soon! Only problem with the app is if you tap the exercise button and add walk and the amount of time walked....does not remember it. :( Hope they fix that problem soon. Maybe the software has some compatible issues with my Galaxy tablet A7 Lite.
"Great watch, bad app. Seriously, I love this thing, but the clock faces are limited. At least provide the same faces with more color options. Also, not being able to search or look through for apps is dumb. You can only look at your apps and ""discover"" up to 3 more by the same developer, most or all of which are already installed. I saw a weather one once. I'd really like to get it. Haven't seen it since. 🙄"
"The app itself is fine. The dashboard is lightly customizable and you can turn various functions on and off. I use a fitbit for step tracking and that's about it, really, so the app and hardware do what I need it to do. However, some more customization options in the dashboard and a more stable syncing process would be nice. Additionally, not a huge fan of having to turn my location on to get a sync on my fitbit 2. That seems like a bit of a stretch to me. In any case, the app works fine for what I need it for. Those who need something hardcore may be disappointed though."
"I enjoy this app. I find it helps motivate me to move very much. I LOVE the sleep tracker. It is really easy to figure out and even the free information is helpful. CON, I don't receive the text notifications and things like that. I don't get notified on my watch that phone calls are coming in. I would like to have a setting on the watch face that shows both how many steps I've taken total AND how many I've taken each hour Reagan just receive the notification 10 minutes before the hour."
"upgraded HR 3 to 4 for better sleep apps. I do like the extras on the app. issues: too many notifications. I only want ones related to fitbit but keep keeping so much more. The buzz on the wrist cannot be effective with all that action. Then the vibrations keep getting turned off because it automatically goes into do not disturb mode. The screen dims automatically so I cannot read it! I don't know if this is the app or the device, but it is very frustrating. Rating would be 5 otherwise."
I used to love using the Fitbit. Now I simply just can't because it is not compatible with the pixel 2. And moving forward I'm not sure if it will sync with the next pixels. I'm sad 😥 Update 3/3/2020 - I have the galaxy note 10 plus and with the fitbit app it is going really well. It runs smoothly and never breaks a connection. I get all the things I need with the sync. I wish the chat was a lot better.
"Great job at tracking progress. The math is incorrect regarding mileage, however; home screen total and mileage-specific page don't match at all. It rounds up or down to the nearest mile so if you're looking for exact mileage for the week, you'll have to calculate it manually. It also displays weight loss (in gray) in a graph that overlays your weight trend (in blue). It would be nice to be able to view the graph with an option to turn on/off that blue line as it obstructs the wight loss line."
"Love that everything is in one place. Food logging, water logging, sleep tracking, steps and calories. Just by using the weight goal and logging my food I've lost over 20 lbs in 3 months and didn't change what I eat. It's the best all in one fitness app. The only issue is getting it to sync consistently. Some days it's fine then others I have to reboot my phone to get my Flex 2 to sync."
"Overall, I've had it for two years now and use it daily. At first I had sync problems with my FitBit but now it works well. I have sync problems every now and then. I've used this device and app to improve my overall health and I find it very useful. I'm using the free trial of the premium features and may keep them after the trial is over. I like that this app keeps everything in a convenient place."
I see a lot of syncing issues. I dont have any problems - switched from manual sync to constant sync after the update. The only problem I have is the new premium service. I purchased the fitbit that I have mostly due to the HR and sleep function. Now there is an option on premium that I'd love to check out. Offers a free 7 day trial. Does NOT tell me what the cost will be after the trial. That is setting myself up for disaster. If you think its a great service then don't hide the cost!
"I've had a Fitbit for several years, and generally I like it, mostly to count steps. However, sometimes when I'm out walking and try to tap on my watch it won't move. Lately it's been taking longer for the steps and the sleep data to show up, frustrating! As far as sleep data goes, it's generally okay, but I honestly don't think it's accurate. I would explain that, but I'm only allowed to use 500 letters. I also can't edit my data, which is frustrating. Not thrilled, but does the job."
"**Edit: I have since learned, after contacting support that in order for the device (firmware) to update, you need to allow syncing at all times so that it gets the update via Bluetooth. This app stopped working sometime in April and hasn't worked since! It's very frustrating because my Charge 2 continues to work just fine but the app receives nothing! It only shows what I've actually done when I set it up for the 'walk/run'. But once I'm done, it goes back to reporting that I'm not moving. 😡"
"It's a pretty good app for what it is. Theres a few bugs here and there when it come to tracking water and sleep, but other than that it's overall quality. My only thing is that food tracking is kind of tedious. It would be convenient if I could create a list of my frequent foods, or even a favorite foods list so it's easier to pick out instead of having to always scan a barcode or search."
"Good app. Did not like the new updates to the overall look but the the functions are all the same. Would like to be able to add actual times of when meals were consumed. Also would like to be able to edit the outcome when a barcode is read. I have been using my Fitbit in conjunction with this app for about three years and besides the items mentioned, I'm very pleased."
"Fitbit is a great fitness companion. I use it to keep track of my sleep and heart rate with my wrist monitor and also my progress on weight goals, and having all the data with useful graphs in one place is pretty dreamy. Good organization and presentation. My issues with the app are that sometimes it has a faulty connection with the wrist monitor and I have to fiddle around and reset things. Also, I still haven't found a way to get the heartrate data out of the app for my own uses."
"Overall it works well. An update gave me some issues with activities, but tech support was able to point me in the right direction to fix it. I do have some sync issues, but I have a new pixel 4xl and they are saying it is too new to be fully tested. Though sync issues seem to be something other phones are having as well. I do not have any issues with other Bluetooth devices and it is a standard that has had many years to mature, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt here."
"I have been using the Fitbit app for a few years. It has been an excellent tool in helping me improve my health. I have not paid for any of the upgrades In trying to rate the app itself I am unsure how much of my experience is based on the app vs the tracker. My only big complaint is that it cannot accurately measure distance when I bike. There is a route I take that is 7 miles, but the tracker or app thinks it is 1.63 miles. Otherwise, I highly value the pulse and sleep tracking."
"Love the app but so no often there is an update and then my Fitbit won't sync. Becomes a struggle to find it. As a matter of fact, since the last update, been having the issue. Drives me insane!! Other than that, when it does sync and see my Charge 3, it's a wonderful app. I had a heart attack in July. This has really helped me stay active and track what I eat and strive to exercise."
"Generally, it's a great app. There are a few things that I wish were changed. I wish you could see heart rate zones while exercising and I wish you could fix the distance as it does not track accurately most of the time while exercising on machines. 6 miles on the flexstride equals 1.3 miles on my Fitbit. I also wish you could set up food combinations so you don't have to find all the ingredients every time you have that meal."
App is good. One thing though: I wish quick view had a time setting. I hate when I'm trying to sleep and i turn my arm a certain way that the screen lights all up in my eyes. It's annoying to have to go in app every single day and turn it off before bed and on in the morning. It would be way easier and simple fix to automate or allow user to designate times that the feature is on.
"I love this app, but it has been having issues with syncing and I've had to uninstall and reinstall for the last month or so. Also with the period tracker it's done an edit to where it's correct but then resets to start my period over when it has just finished. I have to go in and fix it or make sure it stays correct every month. My original review was in May 2020, I'm having the same issue. It won't sync and I've had to uninstall/reinstall at least once a week. What is going on with this app?"
"Only because I don't use all it's capabilities. But it definitely helped me stay on track with my weight loss. I was able to lose 30 lb in a year. UPDATE: upgraded to Inspire2 and getting more data and useful info. Still not using all capabilities, but there is so much goal tracking available surely everyone can kind something to help on their path."
"In response to their response. I did every one of these things ""fixes"" multiple times and have contacted support and still no fix. Overall this is a great app, what keeps me from giving it five stars is the fact that it has a bug that has not been fixed. When logging your meals, the app has a tendency to change your amounts to your previous amounts that you entered in the past. It can be quite frustrating especially if you don't notice it happening. If they fixed this, it would be a solid app."
"If you're looking for a free app that syncs with your Fitbit and records your workouts, it's great. You can manually add other types of workouts besides walking/running, like strength and yoga. Overall I like the app, but I wish I didn't have to go to the website to log food. Also wish I could turn off the sleep 'score' and just look at my sleep data. Would love to try the premium option, but it's way too expensive."
"The app is easy to use and easy to update with info (ie meals). It's nice that the product is mainstream so many other apps can link and sync with fitbit (ie scale). Sometimes it is glitchy and I won't get sleep data when I wear the watch. If I run into a problem, i just turn off blue tooth and reconnect to get data to upload and that takes less than a minute. Overall I love the app."
"Update after several improvements to the app: it syncs faster and takes less steps to initiate. Since I only use it for Alarms, Sleep and Steps, I can't comment on other features. Messages no longer sync to my Fitbit, but I'm not sure it is the fault of the app or the device. Original comments: Does all I need it to do. Sleep stats are very interesting. But, Blaze is slow to sync. Dashboard is too basic. I'd like to be able to switch to something s bit more professional appearing."
"I really like my Fitbit. I am impressed with the amount of information the basic app tracks. There are just a few things that I think would make the app better. I use the female health tracking & have trouble adjusting dates by sliding the bar. I think if I could either type in the date or double tap on the dates to edit my cycle duration it would be great. I have forgotten to wear my Fitbit a handful of times. I was going to estimate my steps & add it manually, but that's not an option."
"I have had my Fitbit for almost six months and I mostly love it. But I just got an update and,suddenly, my Fitbit and the app will not sync properly. I keep hitting the sync button manually (even though I have it on auto sync throughout the day) and while the step count matches, nothing else does. Anytime I try to enter data from the watch, it says to sync. I followed the directions in the help articles and no dice. 😓 It's only 6 months old!"
"The app is pretty good, although the interface can be circuitous. It's also sad that Fitbit Pay isn't just Google pay, (since Google owns fitbit, this should be the easiest change) and means I have to start over with wishing my bank supported a tap-and-pay platform. Once you get around the initial learning curve of figuring out how to do things like search for foods, it's got a lot of options and only a few failure modes."
"I really enjoy the app, but one issue I'm having has to do with the period tracker. It will accurately predict when and how long my next period is and I'll confirm it, but after my period ends, it totally changes the date and shows that I'm just beginning or a couple days in. It's getting a bit frustrating having to go back and keep readjusting it."
"I love this app for keeping track with my fitbit. I would have put 5 stars but the premium membership is ridiculously expensive. I am currently doing the free trial and there does not seem like enough to justify that cost. It would be great to see the bingo within the free version, even a limited version of, because it really is a great way to get people moving."
"*** Update... It's working again. It took a few days, but it started syncing again.Thanks for the reply and for fixing whatever was wrong! It's back to working great. :) Like many others, I loved this app. The last update made it so my phone won't sync to it. Yes, I have restarted it, factory reset it, and reinstalled the app. If u look at the comments, this is happening to a lot of people and not just me. Please fix it."
"I had to fully reset the device after the music install with Pandora got totally screwed up. Once I did that and took my time installing apps one by one and waiting a while between each, things ran more smoothly. After using it for a couple months, this thing is pretty cool. Auto picks up workouts and I get text notifications which are the two best features. Pricey at $200 for the Versa but if you've got the money, go for it. UPDATE: If you lose the fitbit, install Bluetooth Intensity!"
"I only give it 4 stars because my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 does not always sync with my Charge 2. Now it doesn't sync at all. However, the iPad Air 2 works fine but I don't always have it on my person. I tried all the things suggested by multiple sources and it works sometimes. Because of the cloud, when I sync with the iPad when the phone won't sync I can then see the results on my phone."
"While its a great app, i sometimes find it difficult to set it beforehand for certain activities. Driving a tractor over rough ground on a farm, is not an option listed. Neither is there a listing for putting out 20 small bales of hay in hay feeders. It gets recorded as something else that may not reflect the energy or calories burned while doing it."
"I like this app and use it all the time. The is only one annoying thing about it. When I had a Flex, I could see my sleep stats and pattern immediately when I woke up. Now with a 3, it takes forever to see my sleep info. Most of the time, not until li ater in the day. Yet every morning there is a banner encouraging me to upgrade to premium. Why should buy premium when the basic services I've had all along don't work as well as they used to?"
"Very nice UI. Does not always cooperate, especially with more tasking things using your device's GPS to track distance on a non-gps watch. Also has a poor settings / error message response system. Those complaints aside, it is pretty stable, and has many excellent features: from goal setting, to exercise and sleep tracking, to food and water intake logs, and more."
"Overall very pleased with the app, fairly accurate and gives good data points to help in setting goals to improve. One drawback, I wish that when you updated your goals, that it wouldn't reset your goals back to the beginning and make it appear as if you never met your previous goals. I wish it would recognize the new goal and track your progress to the new goal going forward."
"This app keeps me motivated to get up and move. The helpful tips and bits of healthy info encourage me to do better and to push harder. Lately, however, the GPS tracking has gone a little fluey. It has me walking all sorts of crazy paths. Once I actually walked on water! Really? If I could edit the number of stars, I would remove one. Not happy I have to log in to Twitter to contact support. Phones are busy because of what has been going on. :("
"It's great for keeping track a everything, food, steps, sleep and everything in between. Don't like that the fitbit itself randomly lights up especially while sleeping!! You can't adjust the light & in a dark room, it's like a flashlight going off in your faces. Have been tapping thick pcs of gauze over it & it still shines through but not as bright."
"Just got a Versa for Christmas and loved it at first; however recently I realized I havent been getting any notifications on it. No vibrations, nothing! (My problems are not as bad as some that I've seen, like not syncing or showing the incorrect time, but frustrating nonetheless.) From what I've read it seems to be due to the recent update so I hope it gets fixed soon! Edit July 2020: Finally did both the factory reset and uninstall/reinstall of the app and now my notificatioms are back!"
"The app overall is good. My only complaint is that you can't edit workout length. More often than I should, I forget to end the workout on my device. This affects greatly my averages for the workout. Average HR is what I use to determine how well the workout went, so this is very inconvenient. It shouldn't be that hard to put a feature in to shorten the workout time."
"The app has some great features you can use when paired with your watch. But some of the features don't work with all the watches. My least favorite part of the app is Fitbit premium, without Fitbit premium you can't use certain things on the app. Another big downside of the app is that it doesn't work offline (without Wi-Fi or data). This can be a anoying when your are somewhere more remote. You can still use your watch without pairing, but it just doesn't work as well. Overall I like the app."
"Keeping me invested in my fitness goals!! Well, it was...now the app will not sync with my Charge 2 for nothin'! I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, cut the phone off and on, and if I knew how I'd cut off the fitbit itself and cut it back on. It is disappointing because it was motivating to see and track your progress. Please fix this bug. Update: bug has been fixed! All good now."
"I don't understand why there isn't dark mode. Dark mode would be incredibly useful for a variety of reasons. Some people jog at night and it's glaringly bright. Then when your eyes move back to where you're running, your eyes have to readjust. There are also functions in the app that are specific to night time (bedtime meditation) which make looking at the screen physically uncomfortable. Almost every other app has a dark mode option, let's get with the times, Fitbit developers."
"App mostly works well, although it can be a pain to re-sync a Fitbit if you accidentally disconnect it or unpair it. In the recent update, the food logging has become pretty buggy, which was a major reason why I used the app a ton. It won't save recent foods anymore, and it sometimes won't update calories properly. I'm hoping they fix these bugs since they are really annoying for people who use the food logging feature. Still, it tracks sleep and exercise well, and I haven't had too many issues."
"Overall good, but quite buggy lately. Lots of issues with keeping connection to bluetooth and correctly updating counts without having to restart bluetooth repeatedly to reconnect. It's the only Bluetooth device I have to reconnect all the time so I know it's not my phone's issue. I'm not sure if the fault is the app or the device itself, but other than that annoyance it works well."
"Works great! Never had any issues. I don't use the ""log food"" feature because it's not near as intuitive as the ""my fitness pal"" app that I already have all my meals programmed into. Being able to create my own meals and enter on the day I eat them with just one click is pretty important to me. Easy, convenient and efficient. Wish this app did that."
"This is a great application. There are so many functions and sub-functions that are available, and most of the dashboards are easy to read and understand. But sometimes it's not easy to understand where to go to change settings and download available Apps for the smart watch portions, and the premium for the services is a bit high cost compared to the value. 4/5 for the good qualities, losing a star for the advanced features cost and could probably stand to lose another for their ease of use."
This Fitbit app is really well designed and over the years keeps getting better. It's very intuitive. It can track a lot of different sports activities ... except for skiing. That's been the only minor negative I can think of. I really Fitbit should add a Skier Tracker. That would be so cool. Ski stats would be great! Although I've enabled bike mode while skiing and it provides some interesting days. You can see all the trails you've skied on the map when the days done. GPS tracking is good.
"I don't use the app as much as I could as I am not going to the gym etc as much as I was. But I like that it keeps up with my fitness goals and keeps me notified. Which in turn keeps me motivated, especially in this ongoing and ongoing and ongoing pandemic. One reason I won't give 5 stars is When it is done charging I have to restart my phone as it does not resync on its own"
"outstanding app. it's effective with minimal effort. however, it could be better. here are some recommendations for improvement: add a personal photo section to track physical changes. you could make it so you could put two side by side to compare as a 'before' and 'after'. have a section to keep track of body measurements over time. allow users to select the date for 'weight lost since' instead of changing automatically when you mess with your plans."
"I just got the fitbit versa lite watch yesterday. When I got home I tried to set everything up and it seemed like it was working but then I noticed it wasn't staying connected to my phone, I can't recieve any notifications and I can't download apps. It wasn't syncing either or recording my sleep. So I looked up and it said unistall and reinstall the app and I just did that and now i see my sleep record and it seems to be staying connected to my phone. But I am still not able to get notification"
"The whole idea of Fitbit is great. I definitely walk more. The app, however, has a part that is broken and never gets fixed. I'm referring to the diamonds that you click if you choose to take one of the scenic walks in the app. I've reported it countless times. Update: the above problem with the diamonds has been fixed. However, now only three scenic walks are available for people who do not pay extra. Maybe the broken diamonds would have been better?"
"It's a decent app (I have a fitbit sense). There are a few things I would add or change. 1) The clock face listing need to include a list of purchased faces. If the watch will only handle 5, I need to know where the other purchased faces are at. 2) Syncing can be an issue. I've had to restart the watch a few times now to sync with the app. 3) It needs an auto bedtime function, rather than a manual engagement. I'll go through half the day forgetting to turn the bedtime feature off."
"I used to LOVE my fitbit now it's a glorified watch. For MANY months now my charge 2 wont sync and no notifications. I'm so bummed it seems to be getting worse!! Constantly having to manually sync, uninstall the app and mess with bluetooth to try to get it to work. UPDATE ON REVIEW: I am pleased to update that my fitbit does sync by itself now which is awesome! Thanks for fixing that issue... now if only I could receive notifications like I used to I would give 5 stars!!"
"I've had this for a few months with no problems until now. Since the new update to the app I can't get the tracker to update. I've uninstalled the app more than once hoping it would help, but it hasn't. Update: after trying all of the options, unpairing, uninstalling, and leaving it on the charger all day and night I am still unable to get the tracker to fully update. And it now I continue to get a red X on the screen. It should not be this difficult to update and it is very frustrating."
Sync function doesn't work all the time. It usually happens once a month where my Fitbit won't sync no matter what I do unless I uninstall and add my Fitbit again and even then that's a hassle. I tried getting a new Fitbit because maybe I thought my old one was going out. Nope. Same issues. I hate losing all the progress once I reconnect it again. Edit: tried the troubleshooting. None helped until I restarted my phone. Still going to keep the same rating until this issue is NOT an issue anymore.
"Whatever issues I've had in the past are gone. And have been gone through several updates now. The app is working great. My one suggestion is with the food logger. I wish I could select several items from the same surch results without having to start over. Some restaurant list dishes by the individual ingredients. So, repeated searches are required to get them all recorded"
"Great app overall. I am honestly very surprised by all of the bad reviews. I've had FitBit for 5 years now and hardly have any issues. Whenever something does go wrong, it seems to get fixed fairly quickly. My only issue as of the latest update is that the GPS isn't working all of a sudden. It will track for .1 miles and then stop. The rest of the workout tracks fine though. No syncing issues at all. I do wish the food tracking was better, especially when it comes to creating meals."
"**Update: they have really done some good updates and fixes. Haven't had any issues lately. Changed my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.*** I started out really liking this app and my Fitbit versa 3, but the last few months my watch has been randomly disconnecting from my bluetooth and it is really difficult to reconnect it. I'm still trying to get it to reconnect now, this time I had to go as far as uninstalling the app and reinstalling it. Hopefully that works."
"Very complete but needs improvement with period tracker and especially meal and tracking, the information is not always accurate. I lost over 10 kg and keeping it down, calorie counting is very useful, no restrictions just smaller portions and less junk food. Exercise tracking is very good, it automatically knows what and how long the activity is."
UPDATE: 20 Jul 2022 - It is back to working again. I wish it would stay that way. It tends to have hiccups with the app.. OLD REVIEW: I haven't been able to sync up my versa with my computer or my phone since Sept 1. Since then it keeps saying needs to be synced. I removed the app and unpaired and re-added but still doesn't work. I really am not happy. I've just seen all the reviews and notice I am not the only one with issues. They need to fix this issue.
"Had used Charge 2 since 2018 without problems. Purchased new Charge 4 and tried to install. Spent 6 hours trying to sync and setup. Did everything right. Followed directions to the letter. Eventually found from support that Fitbit was having problems across the board synchronizing their wearables. Software updated a day later, then device installed without problems. It's been great ever since."
Overall does very well with keeping track of general fitness data. Would like to see more raw data without fitbit making it into their own chart but that isn't a deal breaker for me. The only complaint I have is that the app is frequently very slow to update the numbers in some categories at the beginning of the day and occasionally will show yesterday's numbers in a category even though today's numbers are there when you open the category.
"I personally go on web toon pretty much everday. There's a lot of good stories and genres to choose from. My one annoyance would be the search system. I can look up a webtoon I know exists a hundred times over, but it won't show up at all for some reason. Instead, it shows a line of webtoons that have nothing to do with what I searched. It gets quite irritating sometimes honestly."
"App isn't flawless, I could criticize some business practice, or a toxic industry, but like products fine 👍. Some pretty good comics ig. A problematic annoyance though, if I press the home button I wanna go home, if I press the back button I want to go back, if I open the app and wanna go to the overview to say, go to a different comic which is pretty vital, it's very annoying to press back and instead go to my phone's home screen like I'm not trying to do something 👁️👄👁️"
"App's great! I've used it for years. It would definitely be 5 stars if not for an issue I've been having recently. After I watch an ad, it doesn't take me to the next chapter. I just watch the ad without the reward that's meant to come with it. I thought I just needed to update the app, which I did, which made an ad work one time, only for it to never work again."
"I've been using this app for awhile... I love the variety of stories. It's relatively easy to use. The coins go a ways for the most part. There are specials to earn coins or a ""daily pass"" on certain stories periodically, which is nice. Plus for the most part, if you find something to read and it's rather far into the story, you can binge it til you have to spend coins. My only complaint is I really wish there was a monthly subscription for this app like some other manga/comic apps."
I love it! I have been using it for a few years now. Two suggestions though. Any episodes you buy with coins should be available offline. Another offline function that I think would better improve performance would be the ability to redownload episodes after you've deleted them. Some people might have missed the timing to finish what they've downloaded or might want to reread a series offline.
"I love the app, though it does have it's flaws. First of all, I do think that many have complained about this, but the pop-ups have honestly gotten a bit out of hand. There is always the option to close it or don't show it again, but regardless of whichever you choose, it stills comes back! Talk about pop-up ads, but the content and features this app provides for readers and authors is great! Overall, I do hope they consider the pop-up problem soon!"
"So many fun stories to read! There are only very little things I would change about the app. I wish the coins were a little less pricey, for my broke peeps out there. I also think it'd be very cool to add a new tab to ""My""👤. It'd be called ""Catch Up"" and it'd be right next to ""Subscribed"" I often lose track of updates, but with a tab like that, WEBTOON could keep track for me; and others! I really think it's a great idea and I'd love to see it added to the app! Please consider my ideas!✌😊"
"it's great! This is the perfect app to find any comic of any genre. Only, I could deal without the ads. There's not a lot, but sometimes it gets annoying. They don't interrupt your reading time, they just pop up at the end of a chapter, sometimes I accidentally click on the ad because it takes a quick sec to load."
it's good and NO adds at all but there's a problem I have to pay money just to finish a series and I always have to every story needs coins or money to finish a series I think it's unfair for people who can't because they have a reason to not be able to right? anyway it's my opinion on webtoon I'll keep having the app though. anyway it's my opinion.
"Really love the app. It's amazing that I can read comics from actual artists. I was disappointed that there isn't a way to get more daily passes. Maybe it could be like watch some ads with a limit of 5 a day and get a few more daily passes? I think it would help, but I could be wrong. I would be more than willing to watch some ads for daily passes if you added that. Besides that I really love the app and everything else seems to work great so far!"
"I really enjoy reading the series on webtoons and then seeing them come out as books or shows years after they started is amazing! The only complaint right now is I've tried updating and re-download to try and get access to the paid feature for fast read and it's not really working. I've tried off and on to figure it out over the past month, but it just tells me to get the newest update. Great app to discover new series and some upcoming artists in my opinion"
"Great app, can be a bit frustrating with the rise of passes/coins/ads being needed to read series but I understand that authors deserve to be paid for their great work. I would like to suggest that webtoons should add a feature to organize series that we subscribe to! For example, I'd like to separate finished series that I read from the series im currently reading. Or Id like to separate the series that are on hiatus between seasons from the ones that are still ongoing. It gets overwhelming."
"The app is amazing. The stories, the authors, i love it! It's addicting as well. The format is easy to use, everything is good except for one thing. Whenever i am reading webtoon for more than 5 minutes, the whole app either crashes on me, or just turns completely black and i have to close it myself. It's getting really annoying. I keep having to close the app and reopen it every few minutes."
"I love Webtoons, but lately the app has been freezing and crashing. My app is up-to-date. I've used it with two phones and it has crashed on both of them. I hope you guys can fix it, because every time the app crashes I have to re-read the whole page I was on until I get back to the place I was reading before it crashed. It's been frustrating. I'll post 5 stars once the app no longer crashes. Thanks!"
"Love it but have one complaint at the moment. It's a recent bug, but still irking me to no end. It keeps stopping on me. I'll just be reading and it suddenly freezes. Can't scroll, up or down, I can't go back to the home screen, can't go to the next episode. Nothibg. All I can do it close out and restart, read for a minute or two, then it freezes again. Please fix. I really would hate to lose it over a bug."
"I love webtoon! I follow many stories and artists, and it's a great platform. My only issue with it is lately it will randomly bring me back to the page of chapters when I'm in the middle of reading, just like if I had pressed the back button. It's usually every few episodes, but it's beginning to happen more frequently. I haven't had this issue in the past, so it may be my new phone, or maybe it came with a recent update. If this issue were fixed, I'd happily change my review to 5 stars, I love this app and it's creators in every way except this small bug!"
App is really great! I love all of the comics and choices you have to pick from! I did run into one problem though. Every now and then a piece of a past episode of a comic will appear over a episode I'm reading and I can't see anything underneath it. I tried redownloading the app to see if that would fix the problem. It worked for a bit before the problem started recurring again. Other than that one problem the app is really great! I fully recommend this app!
"I've been using this app for a few years now. Great content. Whatever recent update went though is causing my app to crash mid comic and dump me back at the chapter list. It's been having for about a week and is getting really annoying. Also, this app used to have a tap to scroll option. Now it's just swipe to scroll. I'd love it if they brought that back. It makes reading a lot smoother. I still love the app, but I thought the developers could hear about some of my recent issues if they don't know about them already."
"Awesome platform for artists to publish their manga and/or comics, but I wish there were a few more options for readers, like being able to edge swipe left or right to change pages, and especially being able to sort/categorize the stories we're subscribed to. As is, it's difficult to tell how many pages are left or if you're caught up on a story, like if there has been an episode you haven't read yet, as the badge for recent upload appears regardless of if you've read it or not."
"I would give this 5 stars but they recently applied something called a daily pass for some series that are completed. It's unfortunately pricey so that's really disappointing. However, the artists, authors, and music composers do such a phenomenal job. Each comic is very unique and enthralling. All types of genres and all types of art styles. Some have beautiful music playing in the background too. The app is easy to navigate and not overwhelming like others."
"Webtoon is a great app. I use it almost every day and enjoy finding new stories and art styles. I've never had an issue with it until the last update. Since then, the app crashes after reading a chapter to 3 chapters every time I use the app. Wouldn't be as bad if it happened when changing chapters, but it will crash mid-way into a chapter. Sometimes it's frustrating and annoying to always have what you're reading suddenly stop and then scroll back to where you were."
Love this app and always reinstall it when I get a new phone. Ton of titles to read. Sadly not all of them are finished as some of the creators dropped them. Two things though: 1. I would love to see an option where it shows completed/finished titles only so you don't have to wait for any update on everything. 2. Fix the bug where it closes the app while I'm reading. Starting to get annoying. 5 stars when fixed.
"My favorite app of all times :) Edit: The app is still a 5 star app, but the free ad episodes are half working. At first they didn't work at all, but they're kinda working now. Everytime I try to watch an ad, it either force closes the page or gives me an error message. Occasionally the ads work, but after one or two of them work I get the error message on the rest of them for the next few days. I tried contacting LINE customer service, but I haven't heard back from them; it's been five days."
"I've been using this app for years and overall it works great for me. Every once in a while an episode will crash, but happens a lot less than it used to. My issue is that the daily/ genre section hasn't updated in a while. Still shows some comics as on hiatus or doesn't list others as completed. I still get regular episode updates through other parts of the app, though. Contacted Naver about it, but they said they couldn't figure out the issue either."
"I love this app, but an issue has been coming up recently. Almost every time I'm reading a webtoon on this app, the app crashes or freezes and I have to back out manually or it'll stay frozen. I thought the issue was my phone, but I recently bought a new phone, which is much nicer than my old phone. My app still crashes. This leaves me to conclude that the problem is the app. Please fix this in your next update. I love this app and it's frustrating to have to reread chapters because the app crashes and didn't save my progress."
"It's a great app! I highly recommend it, lots of good artists and stories are within it, it's easy to navigate through and fun to use. The app is also very helpful if you turn on notifications, it will tell you as soon as the artist updates the comic. One of the downsides is that the app sometimes crashes/freezes up. But, another positive is that it bookmarks and picks up where you left off!"
"Webtoon is an amazing app and I read on it all the time. I've had it since 2016 and it's my favorite app but out of no where the app started to crash and now it crashes so much that it just kicks me right off. I've tried deleting and downloading, closing the app, and shut down my entire phone but nothing seems to work. I'm hoping it's just a small bug and that it gets fixed soon!"
I love all of the stories and all of the extra features except for one. I don't like the fast pass. Could you at least put a ad feature in it so you could watch a ad to get coins then be able to use the coins for the fast pass. It would be really nice if you would add that in so everyone can enjoy stories at the same time. Also I keep forgetting about the stories and to check back in on the day the new episode was released. So the fast pass kinda makes the app more boring.
"I've been using this app for a about a year now and I LOVE it so much. The stories are amazing and it's very official and organized. However, recently I've been experiencing issues with the game crashing and glitching. It'll just kick me out of a story to the homepage and sometimes the app will freeze entirely. I really hope they fix this soon. Other than that 5 stars all the way!"
"I really enjoy the app, it has a lot of entertaining comics I can read and I generally like how it's all set up. Although I do have to make one complaint. I've been having some trouble with going through the comics without having some hiccups in the app. Like, when I try to scroll down to resume reading, it all of a sudden freezes up on my screen and I keep having to exit out of the app and coming back to it in order to keep reading. And the app has shut down completely a few times during a comic I was really enjoying, saying the app wasn't working. It can get annoying to keep exiting the app to make it work every time it happens in order to enjoy the comic, so just putting that out there, hope you guys can fix it in the next update. That's the only problem I have with the app, other than that, the app is a great way to help pass the time and can get you sucked into the comics you read. I recommend it to anyone who has too much time on their hands and loves to read a wide selection of stuff to get into."
"The app is great, tons of comics that I could spend forever reading. There sent too many ads like some apps and I found quite a few comic series I enjoy. However, the app does have some bugs that ruin the experience, namely when I read a comic series for so long, it will start to randomly kick me out of the comic. Great comic app, and I would rate 5 stars if it wasn't for the bugs."
"It's a good app with lots of good, free webtoons. Most ads are unobtrusive, and the app functions smoothly. The one issue I have is that this app eats my battery faster than any other app I've seen, and after using it for a while it makes my phone get uncomfortably hot. Eventually, if I'm reading webtoons for too long, it gets bad enough for the app to crash. Despite this issue I still use the app daily to catch up on my favorite comics."
"Really good for getting into a new series, and the fact that you can attach music files to the comics is amazing to me. It really provides atmosphere and really seems to be the future of comics. However, sometimes the comics load very slowly and the more chapters you go through in one setting, the slower it loads. The scrolling becomes less smooth and more laggy. You have to exit and reenter the app to fix it."
I love webtoon! It has a story for everyone and the diversity of the authors bring a fantastic flavor to the reading pallet. My only complaint is that I've had to change devices twice and both times my reading history wasn't transferred with the new device. I could still see which stories i was reading but not where I left off and it's very annoying. Other than that I have no issues but I really wish that was an option for anyone who needs to change phones or tablets and such.
"Awesome app to get most of your favorite readings. There's so many different comics/manga to get through, you're never bored. The app crashes occasionally if you try to scroll too fast or if you've been on it for a while. Sometimes it restarts my phone... it works 90% of the time if you take your time reading. Great other than re starting my phone when it loads too fast."
"I love this app. It has amazing stories and they are so detailed and the drawings are amazing! My only problem with WEBTOON is that sometimes when I want to read it says I have no internet connection when I have full signal and my wifi is having no troubles, all my other apps work fine. Other than that this app is one of my favorites and I try to use it as often as possible, definitely comes in handy with the quarenteen 🤣"
"I love reading the comics and such, but a few issues. One major problem I have is that it is constantly freezing and crashing when I'm reading, and it is just irritating. It has done this about fourteen times in the past hour which was what motivated me to review it. The only other problem, and a minor one, is that I cannot reply or see replies to the top comments in the section. Great entertainment, would be five stars if it wasnt always crashing. Love it otherwise."
"I love being able to read such a wide range of cool things with this app, there are still bugs that have not been addressed with the July 31st update. Many times, if an episode's pages are slow to load, it will just load a page from a previous episode, or even from a comic I was reading earlier. I often have to back all the way out of the comic and, in some cases, I have to refresh the entire app before the episode will properly load."
"I really love the comics on webtoon! There is such a large selection, and a wide variety of genres to choose from! And so many different styles from artists all over the world. I'd rate as 5 stars, but the app has a tendency to crash if I read too many long chapters in a sitting. And when I got a new phone, it kept all of my subscriptions but none of my reading progress. It's worth the annoyance though!"
"This is far and away the best platform for reading webtoons on the play store. Keeping track of subscribed webtoons and a pretty good explore feature for finding new ones. My one and only complaint is the coin system. I understand the necessity of monetizing, but I think having to continually purchase coins to read ahead is not the best way to go about it. I would be much more interested in purchasing a monthly premium to gain access to early chapters instead of buying coins every week."
"The platform is great. As other users have stated, the Android version begins to stutter and crash after longer periods of use. It would be a good idea to check your thread and process management, since I'm willing to bet the crashes are a result of background processes not being terminated, and then killing the main process for more background memory."
"Webtoon is amazing!!! The comics helped me get through alot of things and i love it! The only thing that i would change is the discover selection system. There are so many wonderful comics that i would love to see featured. If you cannot make this happen for any reason, i will understand, however, if there is a way you could open something like a suggestion box system, that would be awesome!!👌👌"
"The app is great and has a great variety of amazing stories! Amazing artists and story tellers and easy to navigate! They give ""up and coming"" artists a chance to show their talents, and they feature stories that deserve recognition. I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't glitch out so often and glitch to the home page in the middle of reading, leaving me to manually go back and find my spot every ten minutes. Over all, I really like this app and recommend it often"
"Ive been using this app for a few years and it has some of the best comics out there. The interface is good, it looks good, etc. But im really disapointed in how everything is slowly becoming pay to read. I used to use this app way more when fast passes werent a thing. It makes it hard to use the app, and nobody likes waiting when they dont have to. If there was a monthy subscription or if they removed this feature I think it would be beneficial."
"The app is pretty fair with its payment method of fast passes and only one unintrusive ad per chapter page. You could absolutely get through all the content you want without paying for anything extra. There is however a bug that makes the screen go white and dump you back out on the chapter select screen. It was easy to ignore the first couple times but now after about a week of use it happens every couple of chapters and it is insanely annoying, enough to put me off from using it. Please fix."
"I really like the app, it has a lot of variety and amazing things to read. But when I log into the app on a different device, it doesn't save which chapter I left off on a story which gets confusing and frustrating if I cant remember it myself. So far that's my only concern and I wish that could be fixed, otherwise very great app!"
"I really enjoy the app and the amount of content it has. I've had Webtoon for almost a year now and while it could use some work, the ads are suddenly not working. Some series require you to view a quick ad before the actual update. That's fine, however this last app update did something to the ads to where they cannot be viewed. I can't continue reading my fav series because of this. Please fix soon."
"I absolutely love reading comics on here. There's so many amazing ones! And I love that you don't have to pay for anything. The only problem that I have with Webtoon is that it crashes a lot, interrupting my reading. I have the latest version, so it doesn't need to update. If the bug gets changed and the app stops crashing so often, however, I'll change my rating to five stars."
It has a great number of people and content for anyone who loves the visual and reading and even sometimes the musical aspects. My only main problem is that I had another account and lost the password to it. I tried to reset it but it never registered that it had changed or that the account even existed so now I'm afraid if my phone gets damaged or lost I'll have no way to recover my account. If that can be looked into and fixed or a way to make sure it can be recovered that would be great.
"The design is intuitive and easy to use, however it isnt without its faults. The popups can be a bit annoying, especially since they take a while to load and slow down the app. Speaking of slow down, randomly the app will slow down to an absolute crawl and end up freezing super hard. Takes up to a minute or two to actually close out of the dang thing. This happens fairly regularly. Hope this is fixed soon because I'm tired of my reading being interrupted!"
"The app is amazing! It provides great stories from the creators and keeps me hooked with all the events. I just have one problem with when I'm actually reading the comic. Normally the app would freeze up on me when I read webtoons for an extended period of time but since the new update the app would freeze up after 1 or 2 episode, and sometimes would kick me out of the app. At certain times it would become laggy before I would open an episode. Other than that everything works fine.🙂"
"Decent, but sorting features leaves a lot to be desired. There are some AMAZING comics on there, but there is a mountain of garbage too. The annoying thing is a lot of the bad comics (mostly because of horrible writing) are at the top of the list for likes because people get tricked by the the beautiful artwork (mistaking style for substance). Amazing way to read some amazing stories though. Would be 5 stars if they hadn't removed the ability to tap the bottom of the screen to advance."
Some of the best comics I've ever read. Simple to navigate and great quality and variety of free comics. Great option to get to the artists Patreon if applicable right from the app if you want to help support them. Love the option to sign in and save the comics you've subscribed to. Would be 5 stars if it saved your place once you sign in as well. Annoying to have to search for your place in comics hundreds of chapters in if you read from a different device.
"I love the app and all the stories, but a problem I've been having recently is when I'm reading a chapter, the app will seemingly glitch and the screen goes white, then I'm back at the ""for you"" page the app opens up to. The chapter doesn't save my place either, I have to scroll and find it again. It wasn't a big problem at first. But now it is happening every chapter and is getting annoying. Otherwise the app is great and actually let's you read without locking all the chapters like other apps."
"Love it!!! Great series to discover every day! Edit: Webtoon is still great, but the daily pass update has gotten on my nerves one too many times. I'm okay with the coin system (aside from killing your chances of getting a top comment) but at this point, if I wanna read ahead, I'll just go to a different site instead of paying. I want to support individual creators, but a lot of these changes in the past 2 years seem more for the corporate side than the creators."
"it's a really fun app with all sorts of different stories. some people have problems with the fast pass option, but that's only used to see chapters/episodes that haven't been released yet, so the people who don't like paying for fastpasses are just impatient. I highly reccomend this app to anyone who likes stories like these—there's practically ANY genre you can think of. not exactly five stars because it crashes occasionally."
"Love this app, the stories are amazing and the writing is descriptive. The only thing that is bothersome is when you have to pay for the latest chapters, it gets annoying when your really enjoying a story. But ultimately not too bad, they do give you a daily pass for completed series, which is something that I like better than having to watch an ad"
"I love the app there are so many options of things to read. I love how it is mostly free and easy to used app. The only thing is the daily pass for completed stories is getting annoying. I get the fast pass, but it's hard to enjoy something that you know is completed and everything is done yet only able to read a few episodes"
"I really enjoy this app. It allows you to read many original web comic series for free. The daily pass thing is a little frustrating, it would be GREAT to have the ability to keep up three daily passes and use them at once. It is a bit of a bummer though that the app does not remember which episodes or series that you have read if you change devices (android or ios)."
"Webtoon is a really good app and it distracts me from the world around me to think of what is happening in the comics themselves. However, while i was trying to read one of my favorites, it told me to watch a small reward ad to read the latest episode. I go to watch the ad and it says it can not find any ads to play and to try again later. 2 days later, still doing the same thing. Not sure whats going on but i really hope they fix it so i can get back to reading this webtoon."
"This app is very good, it has a wide variety of comics, and the option to read new episodes early is nice, while it isn't for me. The only problem I seem to have is that the app starts to lag after a while of reading, but it resets when I close it for a while. I'm not sure if this an app issue or a hardware/software issue, but either way, this app is a very good place to read quality comics"
"I love having so many Web comics to read. The only downside is that you can only subscribe to 100 comics, I'm hoping that can be adjusted for those who enjoy reading more than 100 comics at a time. Also, as of late, webtoon app keeps crashing constantly while I'm reading. I'm wondering if I need to remove the app and reinstall it. Either way hope whatever bug it is gets sorted out soon"
"This app is AWESOME!! I tried copious comic/ manga apps but this is the best one so far! (This is only a suggestion you dont have to do it) Though I think that there should be another way to get coins to read a comic. Like what if they put a rewarding system where if you complete, for example, maybe read 100 episodes of a story or something else like that. If I could I would give it 4 1/2 stars. Overall it is a wonderful app and keep up the good work! ^w^"
"I love this app! So many great comics/toons/etc. and the interface is super easy to use. The only thing I would suggest adding though, would be the ability to mark a series as complete/read, as in you've finished reading the whole series and would like to declutter your list but don't want to completely unsubscribe/delete the series from your list because you might want to come back to it later and reread it or something."
"I can't express how much I love this app! There are hundreds of amazing stories to read, and I like how Original webtoons update at least once a week, which I think is decent. I love the free coin events; thank you for thinking about the people who don't or can't pay for fast pass. I could've gave five stars, but there's a problem. When I tried logging in with my email, all my progress was lost as if I were using a new account. If there is a help center, I can email some more specific details."
"After hearing of it for a while, I finally cracked and download this app and signed up last night. And overall, so far, I really like it! But I do have two grips. So my first one is... The text size. I'm a visually disabled reader, and good god that size is very inaccessible for me in the menus and such. And my second one is the idea that it should be easier to find comics that you like, I think creators should get to have custom tags on their Webtoons to make them easier to look for."
"Aside from the fact that my bookmarks do not save between platforms or devices, this is a really good app for up-and-coming serieses and indie artists, as well as a lot of damn good stories. The fast pass gets annoying with not being able to finish a series for free until it is ended, but my only suggestion to improve is by making episodes to continue free release on schedule even when new episodes are not being updated. I have used Webtoon since 2014 and am actually amazed at the progression!"
"Good for passing time. The shape of your phone screen can cut into the text sometimes, but zoom allows you to change perspective. I would like to ask that a buffer be provided at the start of a panel, for thise of us who have a camera dipping down on our screens. Takes up a quarter of an inch sometimes. But it is very user friendly for being a free platform."
"Coins should you want to fast pass fluctuating (3, 5, and 7 instead of all being 5 like in the past), and others going on daily pass after the series ends is quite irritating. Especially daily pass if you read the entire series through and now have to unlock the entire story over and over if you want to reread it. It doesn't make sense to have these two systems set up the way they are, or even to have them, at all. Otherwise it's probably the best webtoon/comic app to read your series on."
"Love this app since 2016.. But, i have a suggestion or request. When you change phones, uninstall the app and reinstall it, or clear all the data, you reenter your account, but the webtoon you were reading gets like reset, and then you don't know what was the last chapter you were reading. It would be really useful tu have a system that keeps in memory the last chapter you read."
"This a great reader app for all things webtoon. Plenty of published and amateur stories to make your way through with a seamless and easy user interface that makes finding and reading fun and enjoyable. Great place to read free stories with a wonderful system that allows you to support the artists if you want to. There are also tons of events that make you want to stay engaged and keep coming back to the app. It's amazing! Except, there are zero options to organize your library of webtoons😕"
"it has many wonderful artists and great stories, makes me happy knowing I can escape for a few minutes and enjoy someone's story. the only problem I have it the fast pass coins. I would like to read it all as soon as it comes out. so the ""free comics"" isnt really 100% free. yes I understand they need to make money some way but it still kinds upsets me. at leaselt I dont have to pay for the whole thing... for now."
"I love this app and I've been using it for a while! It always has a wide variety of comics to choose from. The only problem is that recently while reading, my app constantly crashes as I read and I have to go back into the app just to finish my comics. That causes me to scroll over and over again just to find where I was every few seconds. Please fix it."
"Better than reading the comics in-browser, but it has a few quirks and navigability issues. Like downloads working weirdly and not making a difference in how quickly pages load — and then saying you can't download them again if you delete them. Or the way newest comics are always displayed on top, unless the comic is complete, with no apparent option to change this. Also, no built in searchable tags for certain popular genres. But, with so much quality content, there is still a lot to like here."
"lovely, lovely app! fun to read and see all the amazing stories and different art styles, and it's completely free unless you want to purchase coins to read chapters ahead of time. Only downside really is that you only get the option to watch ads to read ahead for select comics, and then you only get 3 total ad opportunities to split between those select comics, instead of 3 per comic. other than that, love it! I read every day!"
"I really like Webtoon and the app, although the main reason why I don't put five stars is the amount of lag the the app generates which can grow tiring. After a certain amount of episodes, it'll get stuck buffering and then put me back at the episode list (I've had the episode list crash a couple of times as well) I don't know if this is just a problem that I have or if it's a major thing. Besides that, the app is great."
"I really like this app a lot. There's so much free to read and the ones that cost r really cheap. Of all comic apps I spend the least amount on this one. But the thing I find most annoying is I'll find a good story to read and get really Into it and then SMACK u find out the the author decided to drop it and there will be no ending! I think there should be a heads up on the storys like that. Oh and sometimes it freezes and/or kicks me off, that's been happening a lot lately."
"I like the wide variety of comics and the ability for anyone to post. But I think there should be a bookmark feature for saving ones you plan to read but haven't gotten to yet, which would be a lot more efficient then mixing them with subscriptions. Also I think the Daily Pass should unlock the episode forever, not just 2 weeks, since you only get 1 per day."
"Overall good experience. They have been moving towards an approach that alienates people who enjoy reading completed series. They allow one chapter free per day. No way to outright buy the whole series. Maybe a membership feature that lets you read all content locked behind daily passes? They have also have been moving to comics that release 3 episodes a week, locking them behind daily pass to entice people to purchase and use coins."
"Amazing app but have had a problem with it randomly exiting out of the webcomic I am reading and taking me back to the title menu. It's been happening for about a week and happens on every comic I read. Starting to get pretty annoyed and may end up leaving the app, opening and scrolling through tons of comic to get to the panel I was in is getting really old."
"I love all the stories. but, there seems to be a bug in the app that keeps blacking out my screen and then returning me to the homepage of mention when I'm in the middle of reading a webtoon. please fix this! it happens every couple of minutes and Its frustrating enough to want to delete it!"
I love this app all the reading you could ever do! I love that they provide options to support the writer/artist and also provide free reading on everything! The only issue is sometimes the app closes on it's own and the memory from what you have read from your computer to your phone doesnt update so you have to guess where you left off. Thank you for providing a great app!
"This is a really great app, and I love it, but lately I've been having some issues. When I try to open the app it shows the green icon then exits. The only thing I've done that helps is uninstalling, then reinstalling. But once I leave the app, I have to do that again. This may just be a problem with my phone, cause this has been happening with another app. I really hope you can fix this, so that I don't have to keep uninstalling/reinstalling the app, its really annoying. Thanks!"
"Great app! Could you make it to where it doesn't require me to actually exit the app then re-open it? I mean by it being so laggy, that I can't even scroll down properly. It takes at least 10-15 seconds for it to go down after reading so many chapters. It usually happens during the 20th comic, but still. It would help if you could fix that small detail; but I still love the app!"
"My only real complaint is the daily pass. I can completely understand fast pass, but daily pass is a different story. It would be better to have an option to pay the full/remaining amount of coins, and/or get rid of the 14 day daily pass time limit. It makes no sense at all because the series is already finished. Other than that, this is an amazing app, and I would definitely recommend it."
"This app is extremely well done for a free one. Its easy to navigate, and barely costs anything. Paying is optional, if you want to access content that isn't released yet, or you want to donate to the content creators. There are no pop up ads from my experience. They make revenue off of advertisements at the bottom of each episode, and you can scroll right past them if you want. (I barely notice the ads) You cant screenshot anything in the app. This is to stop people from pirating content."
"I really enjoy the stories, and I think the system is the fairest out of all the webcomic apps I've seen. Rather than pay to read at all, it's pay to get the content early. Nothing is completely paywalled. The only issue that I have had is that no matter what I change in my phone or in app, notifications don't work at all. This makes keeping up with series updates a little tedious."
"This is a great app for people who love to read stories and don't wanna imagine every scene based off details given. I truly do love this app, but there is one problem that's kinda big but understandable about why it needs to be around, and that's the stuff like fast pass and daily pass, along with coins, and while they're all annoying in their own ways, it's really daily I have a problem with. It's so annoying having released content be locked behind a paywall. Otherwise, love this app!"
"Love this app, usually have no problems with it. However for some reason today it won't load any of the videos to unlock the updated chapters of two of my subscriptions. Went to the help section in the app, did what it said. Cleared what I needed to. That didn't work. It suggested if there was still a problem Uninstall and reinstall, just did that. Still will not load the videos so I can read my chapters. Please fix this problem."
"App is generally great, buy recently i haven't been able to open it. It crashes before it can open, not sure if it's a bug, but it's been days now, I thought it was because u forgot to update, but no it's updated. I thought maybe it's my phone, but I realised someone else has also been having this issue recently. Not sure if it's select few or many people being affected. But other than that recent issue yeah it's really great app."
"I am really enjoying the content and the art is great. Reading is easy and the zoom in feature is seamless. my only issue is with the search/browsing feature. If I'm interested in a certain kind of story, there aren't any filters or tags to search. If they had that, it would be an easy 5 star rating."
"I love almost everything about Webtoon. It has a huge collection of comics to read and you can even make your own. I have one problem though. You can't easily read finished comics anymore. You have to either wait a day or pay coins. I just want to binge read my favorite stories again but I can't because I don't have money nor do I want to spend it all on this. I normally don't have a problem with coins, fastpass is a cool option, but this was a stupid addition."
"Webtoon is one of my favorite apps, and i absolutely love the comics it has to offer. But one thing that really gets on my nerves is the fact that you still have to use coins even to read completed series. And me, who isn't even old enough to buy my own coins finds it annoying that I can't just read a completed comic without having to pay. But other than that, its a great app and would totally recommend!"
"The Stories: I like them so far. I've currently been reading Erma, and I've currently just finished issue 14 The Technical Stuff: this is where everything starts falling apart. I like the interface (since it reminds me of SoundCloud). But... when you're zooming in and out it does this weird flickering thing, (which at one point I used as an effect during the first issue of Erma) and it's kind of sluggish and... difficult?. also it started glitching after: 15 minutes (slowing down and such)..."
"Would like to say this is a perfect app for web comics. It is amazing all right, so much variety in stories you'll find. But, there are 2 big problems I find which drop app to 4 stars. 1 there can be crashes while reading a comic and you'll get kicked out, gets annoying. 2 If you want to get ahead in a comic you can use coins to read it before the free release. Normally you need to pay to get coins, but there are events which can get you free coins, but free coins go away if not used in a month."
"The app is great in general, but the feature 'watch add to see new episode' is not really working for me. When I press it it says try again later there is no ad to watch. Okay I wait for a day, and the same thing happens. That feature only works 1/10 of the time. Other than that great app 👌 really easy to use and no bugs of glitches other than the one I described above."
"The app is great, the stories are great. Recently the app has been super glitchy. It freezes up, crashes, actually glitches out on my phone. I'm not sure what's the cause, it's the only thing on my phone doing this. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling still doing the same thing. Please assist."
"While I don't use the app as much as I used to, in the last month or.. I'm not sure how many, half the time it'll crash while I'm mid-chapter, and I'll have to open it again and scroll down to where I was at. This wasn't always a problem, and a bit ago, it crashed more frequently (Every five minutes or so). While its not as frequent, its still an issue they haven't fully fixed in the time that it's been."
"This is definitely the best comic app, at least from the 50 that I've downloaded, and you should definitely try it out. Unlike other comic apps, you don't have to pay for chapters unless you choose to and the comics are blatant copys of each other, everything here is original and enjoyable. The only problem I have with it is the fact that when you log in on a new device, the chapters you were reading dont carry over, only the comic. It gets so annoying having to figure out where I last left off."
"I love this app for the most part. It's great and I love reading the stories. The one thing that bothers me and that has always bothered me about this app, is that if you get logged out, it does not save your place. All the webtoon's that you are subscribed to are still there but if you left off on a certain chapter it will no longer show you. It basically resets like you never read that comic. I wish Webtoon would fix this, I would love this app even more if it did."
"Overall a really great app! Although, when I am trying to log in using my Google credentials like I always have in the past, Google says there is an Authorization Error as Dropbox no longer complies with their secure browsers. Hoping there will be a fix or update. This is one of the better cloud storage apps (Note to devs: I have a screenshot of what it says if you need it)"
"This app works well, and I've used Dropbox to store and manage my files on several devices since 2017, but lately, it's developed this issue where sometimes, when you attempt to open the app, it will show the logo for a moment, as usual, but then switch to black and close the app. No amount of restarting or re-installing has fixed this, and I often find myself having to navigate the Dropbox website on mobile instead in order to see and manage files. I love this app, but wish I could use it more."
"very convent and organized app for important files, pictures ECT. the only issue I have with this app and the reason I gave it 4 stars is the cost I believe is a little to high for how basic the app is. There's nothing fancy or unique about this app that should make the price be this high. I use this cause of convince but if something else comes along I wouldn't mind trying out the other app over this one if the price is reasonable with more options. lower the cost or add more features to use."
"It does allow me to access all of my files, but I use the app mostly for transferring photos from my phone to computer. This is where the app is quite annoying. I set the photos to upload, but the upload only processes while I am on my phone. I cannot put the phone to sleep or even forget about it for too long, as the second my screen goes away, the upload process stops. I have an S8. How can this be a proper function?"
"I have a Samsung Galaxy tablet 10.1 2014 edition. My Dropbox icon has disappeared from my home screen and my app list. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but still have no icon. Does anyone know how to restore the icon? The app works fine on my tablet, but I have to navigate to Settings, General, Application Manager to start it. That's rather tedious, but it's the only place the app shows up for me to start it - other than going to the Google Play Store to start it from there. Thanks for your help! I'm running Android 5.1.1. Yeah, it's ancient, but it's the latest release for my tablet."
"This is an essential app for my daily work, and definitely worth the subscription. One feature that id like to see implemented is a way to create shortcuts to different files within your dropbox without having to download them using the ""offline"" feature. I frequently open the same word doc, and have to fish for it through the folder structure. I'd like an easier way to access it."
"I'm sure the app is great. I don't use it very much anymore, not since they decided I could no longer access my Dropbox from all my devices without purchasing a license for every device above three. Doesn't really matter to me any more, I'm moving all my files else where then I'll just delete this whole Dropbox Service from all my devices anyway."
"DB is an incredibly useful tool that can be used to send data and information across several platforms! It's easy to use, but their prices tend to creep up, and they don't even send you an invoice or receipt. They just snatch the money and dip, but it's tough on my accounting as I manage several accounts for my company... 4 Stars B/C of that!"
"If you saw it, I retract my previous frustration-fueled review. I was wrong about some of my assertions. The android app appears to work, mostly. However renaming the app to Dropbox: Cloud Photo Storage made me think that it was a different app, separate from Dropbox proper and that the full-featured Dropbox app was no longer available. Bad move on DB's part to rename the app that way; the new name will limit its use."
"Drop Box is the best . After a year of comparing onedrive, Google drive, iDrive (using premium for all 3). They are just too damn slow on mobile and especially on the desktop. I learned my lesson after onedrive erased 3 hours worth of videos. Google drive or photos didn't even upload them automatically. Until another cloud system less expensive and works just as good or close to it I'm staying with dropbox begrudgingly for now.11.99 per month is too much. That's 144 dollars per year."
"Does what it's supposed to mostly.. but I do have a bit of an issue.. I was trying to back up my SD, but it appears I can't just select the the whole thing at once, I can't seem seem to select files, folders and photos at same time... Also seems like I can't select a folder that has sub folders (I don't have apc I can use for back up.. Moto E (2020)"
"Pretty good for a lazy person. I've been using the free version for years but upgraded to 1TB paid version recently. My only complaint is that it slows down startup on my ancient devices while it syncs - but that's probably not DB's fault. As for the complaints about 3 device limit for free version - in this world, you get what you are willing/able to pay for. If the monthly fee is not something you can do, it's good there are still some free services available."
"I have been using Drop Box for many years, and never had an issue. In fact I love it! But ever since my latest android phone update (I have a Samsung galaxy 5G) the app will not open. I think there is something not working properly with the update. I can still open it on my computer fine, and in the Web browser on my phone, but this is annoying and I keep getting prompts to open in app but I can't."
"I have loved Dropbox for years. I love that I can use on my phone. Lately, however, it has been doing a very strange thing. I use it to view a spreadsheet for my company, and I've used it to do this for years. Now, suddenly, it freezes for no reason. Or gets stuck loading. I've updated the app I don't know what else to do."
"It would appear that the architect(s) of this now fine application has moved well ahead of the competition in recent months. Yet there is still always room for improvement. But having said that, Dropbox is, in my humble opinion, the primary choice for storage. Unbeatable."
"WOuld be a 5, but my word docs keep coming up as ""read only."" So annoying, bc I CAN edit ,but the warning, even after dismissed, does NOT go away. Docs for school so I use Dropbox constantly and yesss, the ""this is a read only,"" banner hoovering at the top of EVERY doc is exhausting. Start saving to Samsung cloud to get away from banner. Had loved Dropbox until this recent thing. Otherwise AWESOME...across devices, good storage, very secure. Tried to fix in settings too."
"Best app for all storage!!! My only issue is sharing. First, it shows ""only you"" to see anything, then it's also not easy to share a pic to friends or Social Media sites. I don't want to share a link."
"Best app to keep and store files. Easy access at anytime, anywhere! You can get the amount of space you want. Very affordable and reliable for your files. I really enjoy using this app. Kudos to the developers team!"
"Dropbox is an excellent cross platform storage solution, but the fact that the minimum paid storage size is 2 TB at £9.99/month makes it too expensive for me. 200 GB for 99p and I'd sign up at once!"
Dropbox is getting bigger and bigger (and slower) with all the functions we don't need. Where is simple Dropbox from 10 years ago?
"Some basic features seem to be unavailable on mobile, like being able to easily rename documents, but otherwise I use it all the time."
Wait over 20minutes no one answered the phone. Recommend that your staff have a mobile so one can answer and keep people informed what's happening. I was told that get your cases ring we will answer right away and send a bus. Lucky for us it wasn't raining. Going out system was very impressed so was expecting the same on arrival. When your told bus would be there right away after travel from Bangkok last thing you need is no one answering a phone and hanging around.
My dropbox secure cloud storage app version: 326.2.4 is still version android app to update cause I'm just tapping my touchscreen fingertip about seven times
I love Dropbox but please improve the mobile navigation UI is very painful for me especialy to go back. Please Improve.
"Using Dropbox many years. It easy to use, user friendly and best online storage platform. Yesterday my laptop taken over by trongn virus attack. All the files and images got extension (.jyos). Help me out while I am not losing my data on Dropbox please"
"Very useful app and easy to navigate. The reason for 4 stars is the limitation imposed by the app to where to save the files. Also, downloaded to SD card files are nowhere to be found."
"It's a pretty good app and online service but what I do find annoying is the updates that don't indicate what has been updated or changed, I'm all for moving forward but it sounds as if whatever is being updated is cloaked in secrecy, please be transparent."
"I've been using Dropbox for years and it's indispensable, but I think they need to update their interface, especially with regards to photo organization. I've gotten used to it, and I'm sure I'm not using it in the most optimized way, but I just feel like it could be better in that way."
If you can afford the yearly rate go for it. I no longer can. Stay away from OneDrive. It's garbage.
"Please roll back the recent update. The Export options need to be back as before. The recent update has made opening, sharing & printing files a 3-4 step process which was just single step before the update. Everything else is just great!"
"I Love Using Dropbox. It Helps Me Do Inventory & Lets Me Focus Moving Files To Imported Files, Labeling Them So I Don't Embark On Any Trademark Issues. Great Idea, For Future Start Up Businesses. I Recommend Dropbox. Definitely Compatible With Some Of My Ideas. So There's Hope. In Finding Help With The Start Up Phase Of Nothing Personal Strictly Business. Run Ad Campaign's First. As Informational Services."" What We Offer & Our Hiring Department. Still Working Out Details, Finding Supportive Apps"
Very good app. Highly recommend to others who need to share files on cloud.
"The app is nice enough for me at present because I do not use it for all the purposes. I use it to just view my files simultaneously on mobile and other device. The flaw here is the transferring of vedio clips even it is 00:12seconds long, it would take a lot of time (10-20minutes) for the complete transfer, not my data speed to be blamed as it works in Mbps. The other flaw is that it do not allow me transfer more than 8 files at a time. This kills my time. Otherwise it's a good app. ♥"
Great app 2gb isn't very good should make the app like 6gb as factory
"Good for what it does, but a few issues. One I noticed is that the app version does not let you delete (remove from your view, and storage quota) folders shared by others, only your own. Option greyed out or missing altogether in the appropriate contexts. This is not the case with the web version, so a bug. UPDATE: recommendation in review feedback made no difference, but I see there is a ""remove from my Dropbox"" option in ""Manage access"" so perhaps more of a terminology issue across platforms."
Unparalleled reliability & accesibility. Much appreciated!
"Working with old photo's , need cross platform Compatibility."
"After update can't open "".md"" files using dropbox file editor"
"It's pretty weird I can't upload any files using the app, so I have to do it with the web version. Everything is OK except this kind of bug."
"Overall Dropbox is great (even tho pricing isn't too competitive) it works pretty well both mobile and on desktop but I have to take one star away for android app getting changes nobody asks for, that additionally make no sense. Recently they got rid of export feature to make you use share button instead, it was so stupid they had to bring old version back. Now when showing file you cant get access to three-dot menu with export etc. because for some reason they deleted it, and it's only on list"
"Meh, not a big fan of cloud storage. It's okay for large file transfers on the rare occasions It's necessary."
"The 'export' feature is like an afterthought and should be more prominent in the android App. It should be called download not 'export' - this would be consistent with the web browser version of Dropbox, and it is a more logical use of language. Other than this, I've had no other problems so far."
"I've been using Dropbox for well over a decade and it is the best immediately folder and file sharing system for Windows users, using a folder interface similar to that of Windows. My only gripe with the app is not being able to play audio in the background - the second you come out of it, it stops."
"I think this service is great. There are many cloud options but this one works across all devices and so when one device is lost or goes missing you can still access the data from that machine. I love this service but it is very expensive, so I have to think about renewing because there are a lot of cheaper options out there."
"really handy and helpful app, although the scan document to PDF feature could have better quality, that would make it 5 star!"
"Wonderful for what it does although it should use more standard terms for such simple things as saving a picture to my phone (their term is ""export"") and it shouldn't make me wait while it tries to open excel files that it can't open (they may have fixed this partly- It just shows a blank screen when I select my password protected excel file, I need to tap an unlabeled button to open it in Excel app)"
"When using ”Share -> Add to Dropbox” feature, the app doesn't have any visual cues about how to navigate the folder tree. You have to use the back button to go up the folder tree. Which is pretty unintuitive given that on Android, the back button usually means ”Go back to the previous view” (like a browser's back button), and since this is the first view, going back would go back to the app I came from. Just add a button with an up-arrow icon."
Initial review: solid mobile client for my purposes. Works well with backing up selected folders on my mobile devices (though it was unclear at first since i had to save new files in order for dropbox to discover other folders and display the option to select which folders to back up) and accessing cloud stored files to upload in other apps. Would be a big improvement to support search when uploading a file to another app and browsing dropbox for files to upload (only works directly in-app)
"Could use some improvement but works for me, keeps all my stuff saved 👍"
"While I upload several files, it suddenly fails with a generic error message ""We run into a trouble"". I think it's not suitable for uploading several files at once. Do it one by one. Or you'll lose track of files which you uploaded and which ones it failed etc.."
"Was able to upload a very large video file that i wanted to share with another user. However, why can't I access a library instead of being presented with all my photos. It necessitated scrolling thru hundreds of pics until i found the right one. Why can't it access the Android file system. My thumb is still sore from that ordeal."
"Good app and excellent service. If I would comment on the app features it would be to allow users to choose the directory when uploading and not show all images or docs to choose from. The second thing is to have the ability to upload a folder from the app. However, the service is impeccable especially in team collaboration."
I installed dropbox to download some photos from a group tour. It is by far the best cloud storeage I have used. As I have a 200Gb micro SD card in my phone I have no use for the app plus I dislike the idea of cloud storage. Anyone stuck with a phone with a small memory may wish to try this as it is very easy and intuitive to use.
"I have been a subscriber for more than 12 years and It used to work so seamlessly. It has become so much more complex and intricate and I cant make heads or tails of it these days. Yes , more ""powerful"" but very confusing with so many moving parts. But still my favorite cloud storage/synced app."
love Dropbox even if it's too complicated at times
"Can't do anything as when I try to sign in, I'm told I have no Internet connection, despite having one. Reinstalling, and restarting my phone did not work. Edit: can sign in now, but needed to unlink all devices, which on its own isn't bad - except that one of them was the one I was trying to link at the time."
As a general rule I don't update apps because I read all the terrible reviews of people who do lol. So my Dropbox is still working fine. However I would love the option on the app to choose where I store files that are available offline. On my phone I'd like to use my memory card instead of the phone itself. That is all.
"This app or rather platform is very huge, tremendous & helpful. It has so far kept my data in basic mode for over 5 years without it losing quality nor picture in any way, thanks to the Dropbox Team."
"I've never really considered using an an additional storage App before. I'm not even sure how I got started with Dropbox. I'm pretty new to technology, and not sure on my feet at all. But this App is so clear, easy, actually makes learning more about all this stuff kinda fun. lol I really use it for hours at a time. It serves 2 purposes for me. Storage, and I get to scratch my OCD itch.... Ha no, really"
"The company is quality but i almost hate the interface on android and windows equally. It uploads, downloads, and backs up your things, but in a VERY clunky way. Almost like they over analyzed what people want and use. There is a 2 gigabyte limit for free use. Give us dark mode at least, of you're not going to give us a compact view. Drop box is good but gdrive does almost everything better. Almost everything."
"apps works wonderfully. the ui is clean and organized. The only thing i wish was added was the option to change accounts quickly. I have two accounts, one for art and one for schoolwork. It would be nice to be able to change between those two accounts without needing to sign out and sign in multiple times."
"Dropbox has always been great and innovative. The only thing I long for is Markdown support with basic syntax coloring in doc editing. I've been able to drop Google Docs with my writing and just edit files in Dropbox itself, which I order, but I don't have a means of visually seeing my styling. It's not a big deal, and I really don't want full Wysiwyg support, but a little extra something here would be nice."
The app is very useful and important but it is next to impossible To manage. I got a large free Dropbox from quicken and a tiny Dropbox from Google but I am on able to combine them or to switch between them from my phone. I am still trying to figure out how to get the app in my phone to link to the big one the big Dropbox
I like it but the one glaring issue is you can't choose to download to your sd card by default or at all which is insane to me. I have to use a third party app just to sync dropbox to my sd card. My internal storage is all full so this feature is quite required. Please add this simple feature.
"it's one of only app that can do what it claims ! works best with 365 apps but personally I got pro 10, hp all in one with with gaming card and video as well as RCA labtop & Howard packet labtop it it have started file on unit altered it saved photos . Bock office situate modified seen up chain up dates get confusing but that's all mean but if loaded keep updates different emails different ways . takes longer but less confusing."
Quite user-friendly.
"This is just an FYI. Been using this app forever without a hitch. But am now on week 4 of a data recovery exercise using pro tool: EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard (it's the best). Dropbox support IS trying to help but now wants access to my whole disk = a privacy problem. BEWARE: Without your knowledge, understanding or permission, their Sync capability completely alters your disk structure by moving everything into a hidden folder and then aliasing everything. Disaster recovery is NOT assured."
"Dropbox is exactly what it says it is, no hidden agenda which is extremely refreshing in today's world. It is user friendly and efficient in every way except one... You cannot have more than one Dropbox application running on a device at a time."
Works well overall but you have to refresh literally any folder you open to show changes for example I just opened a folder where I expected to see a folder I added via Desktop over a month ago and it did not show on the Android app until I swiped to refresh the folder. Changes should show automatically and not require a manual refresh.
"I really liked Dropbox till I kept getting notified that my free subscription was full and I'd have to purchase more space. It was great as I've had it since 2016 and now have to pay so I'll probably change to a different provider. Otherwise great app and good quality, easy to use."
"Liked it at first, but even after getting the subscription it won't let me properly download files. I want to download my stuff to my device and be able to reach said stuff from my files manager on my phone. Not only from dropbox. Edit: Changed it to 4 stars because someone from dropbox tried to help me. The way he/she explained it will probably work on other devices. But mine won't show the options as the developer described it. I'm using a oneplus 6."
I wish the free version has more storage instead of just being 2 GB. I think that it should be at least 4 GB - 8 GB of storage so that more people are going to use it and so that people can enjoy the app just because of more storage! Hopefully this feedback helps so that dropbox will improve and more people will use it! Thank You for Your Time and Have a Great Day!
Great app. Been using it for more than 10 years. Only issue I have is the base pricing of the premium subscription. It costs more than 5 times of Google One. 11$ per month is just too much and I don't have a requirement of 2TB storage. 100 GB at 1$ would be great.
"On Android I would request a new feature please. In the app you can tap the plus button to upload, then tap ""take a photo"" and that photo taken would will be directly uploaded to Dropbox. However to take multiple photos you need to keep repeating this. Please add an option to ""take photos"". It would be a major productivity booster for me. Please implement this, this is possible with other apps like project camera and UploadCam. Thank you"
"My use for it is simple, it's a scratchpad for ""emergency"" uploads to get more space on my phone when I'm out and about, or to share photos/files with others. Even though Google Drive is on my phone, and I use it too, uploads to this are much faster, it's simpler to use, and easier for others to see what I'm sharing. Keep it up!"
Very versatile and wider applications than I thought
"Works great and is the easiest and cleanest one of the bunch for cloud storage. BUT their security certificates (or what ever they're called), aren't what the company expects for security, so i can't access my files from work computers. Bummer."
"I selected a few files from many, saved to a folder in the mobile device. Then I wanted to delete the saved files: Do you want to delete the folder from Dropbox? The selected files became unselected after save. Now which ones were saved as all are versions of the same file."
"I have notice a bug in the app. Once we go to share file to add it in Dropbox, it add the file to sub folder instead of main file folder which is difficult to find. No option to choose folder where to store. Please resolve a bug. Thanks"
"It's a really good music app because you can actually listen to it off line and not pay for it but the reason it's 4 stars is because it doesn't go to the next song by itself, you have to physically press the next song. You won't believe how many times I got in trouble for changing the song while doing yard work, them thinking I was playing on my phone."
"Free version is excessive limited when compared to other options, especially in space and number of synced devices. Also, the main screen of the app could be improved a lot. That said, it is a good software."
ETA the developers reached out and told me steps to follow up to solve the issue. For now it seems to have rectified itself I used to love Dropbox and relied heavily on it. For the past 2 weeks when I try to access my files the app immediately closes without being able to access the files
"Overall it's s good app. The only complaint, and it's minor, is after scrolling down through the files and then opening it, once you go back to the list of files it starts at the top instead of the file where I clicked."
"Dropbox is great and Ive used it for years. but I only use it as my backup, my google drive being my primary. I wish it was free, as so many other apps that are similiar offer the same or more than dropbox. I will eventually be changing services only because I know I can get more for free."
"I get shared videos from a friend and most of the time they work fabulously but sometimes they glitch a bit and pause every few milliseconds. Apart from this I adore the app. It is layed out very well, and it is very easy to use."
"I've used Dropbox for a long time, it's great and I pay for an annual subscription. One feature the app is missing is the ability to make a shortcut on the home screen to a specific file or folder in the app. Please make this happen! Thanks 😊"
Great facility to have over different devices. I find the filing system a little hard to navigate at times and the controls are often not as I guess they will be. But a vital tool nonetheless.
"Wanted to get some device storage back on my Galaxy S4 so I uninstalled a number of updates on various apps....don't uninstall Dropbox updates. If you do - possibly like me -you will be unable to access your gallery. Was very easy to restore the updates, though, and the gallery is accessible again."
"Latest updates have lost functionality to view (some) epub files. Cleared cache and reinstalled but this did not resolve the problem. In fact, epub files that opened previously then stopped opening. On edit: took the dev advice and got a lightweight epub reader which works alongside dropbox. Though would prefer all files opened in dropbox directly as they did before this works just fine and the interoperability does offer additional bookmarking functionality through the third party app."
"My only quibble with all cloud storage is; if a pc or laptop goes down and only a re-install is the way, and what ever case, files on cloud storage is required to get the system runnimg and you have just thst one system and you need files to get things back , theres going to be no network. My way is I dont rely on cloud, only for no-essential files, and I use a portabe storage, then instead of going to cloud for all the things required (s/w etc),I use my NAS storage. Long winded, sorry ..."
"I have been working with dropbox for many years and never lost a file, started using a WD Cloud server a year or so ago for ""easier access."" Just switched back to using dropbox for everything again after WD lost every CAD file for the last year. If it works don't fix it."
"Have had the app for years and never had a problem. All of a sudden my password no longer let's me in. I have updated the app and i still can't get into the app with my password. I have been trying to reset my password but can't find where i can do that. Is there anyone out there with any suggestions, thx Frank"
"Great place to store my files and very easy to use. Just one problem - I have a personal email and a work email address and I can easily swap between the two in the same app, wish I could do the same with Dropbox."
"This application has made my life so much easier, especially since I can use it for work projects and also my personal life. I only wish it were easier to organize the files. I log into it on my computer to reorganize everything saved on my android."
"Secure, reliable & dependable. Good integration with external 3rd party apps, from within various platforms and devices. Easiest of all clouds to use. But short display name space.has caused confusion owing to truncating displayed file n6ames."
easy to use great app. not many issues. kind of annoying that it emails you everytime you sign into a different device. even if it's the same 3 devices you use all the time. only gave it 4 stars cause other apps offer more free storage than this one.
I love using dropbox as it is easy and quick to transfer or share files. But recently my phone keeps freezing or stop working everytime i try to trasfer video files. I have cleared cached and reinstalled dropbox but it is still reacting the same way. How much space Dropbox requires to work smoothly?
"I am happy with app. I found following issues (1)Not able to use Microsoft office app (mobile). So I need to download word,excel,and PowerPoint seperately. (2) Not able to edit a new file created offline before syncing. (3) Not able to use paper app offline in computer."
when I share my Firefox link to Dropbox it does not tell me what folder I'm in. it just says add link to. the original Dropbox worked properly but the latest updates don't show the folder. please fix. I always have to back out right to the root directory so I know what folder I'm going into. pain in the butt.
"Been using for many years. But recently after updated to newer version, i can't rename my file's name while using the app. At the end i have to open browser, search dropbox, sign in then only able to rename my file's name. How to solve this problem? Quite troublesome for me to do each time."
"It has got great books and I really love the book am reading, just don't like the fact I can't access it due to the coins. It should have games or many different options to win coins so as to get free episodes. Also the books are too long with 1000+ chapters. Please do cut it short, so we can read more books. Thaks and hope you guys improve on the app."
"I have to say being an avid reader, the titles - stories - characters are all interesting, vivid, and either made for the television or the big screen. The writers are good with just minor errors. Pricing should allow reading for a week, then chapter bonuses make more sense (and could be used on daily readings). That is the reason I didn't give 5 stars. The pricing should benefit different types of readers, for different varieties and scenarios. A week or month, reading helps kill time."
"I love the new fresh stories I can find on this app! There are sooo many books and authors to choose from. Books about anything you want to read I bet you can find. They are surprisingly very good stories, the details are good enough to picture it all in your mind. You will definitely want to purchase coins though instead of just waiting for the next chapter or building up bonus coins! So be prepared for that 😏"
"I like how you're able to read a good bit into the story in the beginning, really gets you hooked. The daily check in bonus is good marketing, however, if you want to do the bare minimum to receive the extra bonus, you'll only get to read one chapter a day and chapters is really short. Well, for the book I'm reading, it is. Not sure if it's the same for other stories. I can never seem to pass the 2/3 day check in. I'm thinking it has something to do with the short chapters. I forget to return."
"Good books but cost is crazy. I got hooked read one of the book while I was out of work for bereavement. At first the cost was minimal and I thought it would unlock the WHOLE book, but it doesn't only more chapters. Just when is starts getting really good and your on the edge of your seat into the story line, you run out of coins (points) and have to pay again. I'd rather pay one fee and get the whole book than chapters at a time."
"Very good reading app. Nice selection of books. Coins to book ratio could be better. There should be a feature to explain how to use things like ""bookmark "" in the app. I would also like a dictionary feature added for some of the stranger words in the stories. But very happy with app so far."
Loving the story of currently reading just hate that I need to purchase points to continue reading every so often. I've already spent more on this story than I have on most digital completed digital books I purchased to own. So I have to try and earn points just to read a chapter at a time. I wish we had the option to purchase the book at a flate rate. Other than the spending I'm enjoying the app and the funtions it provides. Like I enjoy the option of having a Text-to-Read available .
"I love this book I've been reading When His Eyes Opened, it's a great escape from reality at times, and I've briefly started some other titles as well. The only major issue I see is the coin system. I hate when I get to the point where I need more coins, and can't just continue reading, but other then that it's great. Easy to get around the app, and easy to read on my phone and tablet."
"I enjoy this app. I wish the cost was a bit more streamlined and the daily/reading rewards were higher. Overall there are some really great stories and new authors to choose from. If I could make one change, I'd add a section for minority characters so that all readers had a chance to view a character they could possibly relate to. Representation is important!"
"I had a hard time choosing between 3 and 4 stars. I don't like the costs of some chaptwrs and there's no way to make sure the chapter is long enough to be worth it, BUT they have a huge selection. Though some are roughly written, many are engaging and captivating. I appreciate the reading settings and adjustments that can be made."
"I really like the stories offered but it is pricey, chapters are not very long and it seem the writers do not update daily. So I do not think books should be allowed to be posted till they are finished. Some books I have started its been almost 2 weeks with no updates. Other than being able to get the menu bar to show, the app is easy to use."
"I think the books are to expensive if your are only using coins, its nice to have the ability for so many ""bonus"" that act like coins, but still, super expensive compared to what you would pay for a physical book/something in kindle. Most of the stories I've read are decent though. I do wish there were a netter way ti make suggestions for editing, because some of the books are painful to read."
"This is one of my favorite book apps, I enjoy most of the stories and be able to read for free. The only downside is the editing needs work and I don't care for the on going stories. I only want finished ones, I don't understand how they are not already finished or why, whats the point of publishing books that are not complete."
"I like the choices of novels on this app. I've been looking everywhere for mythical stories but every time I look I'm skeptical bcuz many don't make sense. This app is one of those too but honestly I'm captivated by some stories and I do want to finish one I'm currently reading. The whole coin thing is frustrating and ya u have to pay to finish reading some stories but hey, maybe it's worth it."
"I have read numerous books on here. They've all been great. There's definitely room for improvement, though.. as it can be quite expensive to read a book depending on how many chapters it contains, and although I love the books and can't put it down once I start reading, they do contain grammar errors and should not be so expensive.."
"I like the stories on this app because the one that I am reading is very interesting but, the audio needs some work. It repeats sections two and three times and I don't know why. The originality is refreshing and continues to hold my interest. Although I currently like the story that I am listening to, I hope it doesn't turn out to be a saga. They tend to become boring and discouraging."
"I love and appreciate the variety of genres. I am always able to find a new book to read and I find the app easy and convenient to use. The lost star is due to a couple of factors, the need for editing for many of the books (incorrect word choice, spelling, punctuation, and grammar) and how some of the books are really long (over 2000 chapters and still are ""ongoing""!). I would love to see the total cost of bonus points/coins needed listed on the main page for each completed book."
"The app has intriguing books but it's too bad you have to spend hella of a lot more then a regular hardcover. Not everyone can afford this. I have other book apps that have the books for free and all their stories are amazing. I've been able to read each one I pick. On this app, I've got almost 20 books I can't even finish because you have to unlock. Soon I think I will have to delete this app. Not worth to keep spending more money if I can't finish a book and enjoy it."
I am currently reading several books. One of the books im reading has way too much word repetition in it which makes the book longer then it needs to be. The chapters are way too short in return you ended up having over 1000 chapters. The coins are expensive. So I don't buy any. At first was a little hard to understand how to navigate in the app. Now I'm a pro.. lol. I recommend it to my sister & she reads as much as I do The stories keep you wanting to read more and interested in the book
I would like the ability to turn on or off the autochapter purchase in settings and have it work! They do not currently save my choice after I've turned it off. I've paid $30 plus other free coins earned to read 122 chapters of 1 book. It's going to cost another $10 to catch up to it's recent post. And it's not done. It takes 30-45 coins per chapter. Which can be earned in about 2 days for free. Achieving 60 minutes of reading is difficult though when you only want to read one.
I'm really enjoying this app. It is a little frustrating how slow it is to earn coins (if you don't want to pay for them). I also don't like how the chapters start out costing very little and then cost close to 50 coins as the chapters continue. Of course it's after you get hooked. But the slow earn helps to keep me from reading the whole story in a day so it's not all bad. But the stories themselves are really really great! Definitely worth the wait!
I have enjoyed every story I've read on here so far. I really enjoy the baselines and the plots are incredible. I love that theres an option for audio as well. If i could change one thing it would be how long it takes to read a chapter especially the shorter ones due to needing coins. With two kids it's hard to put money towards coins and wish there were more options daily for enough to read more than one chapter at a time.
"I literally would give this app all of the stars in the world, if it didn't cost so much to read a book. I would absolutely love it if I could buy the chapters outright, instead of stopping and going soooo much. Also, if the cost of the chapters were more consistent, I wouldn't feel as if I was blowing through money. I loooooooooove the books and can't wait to finish one."
I really enjoy the stories I am reading. I started with the divorced billionaires heiress. It had too many chapters and I lost interest but the werewolf series I am reading keeps my attention. I think the authors are doing a good job putting out their content. My only issue is not being in control of whether I want to read the next chapter. It automatically uses my coins which gets frustrating when you are bouncing from 2 different books.
Found a great book to read which has been able to keep my interest. There have been some repetition in the written text and some errors. This is annoying especially when paying to read. The fees are a bit high when I'm currently only 26 percent through the novel. That said I am greatful that there are daily rewards to allow me to read text for free. I have selected some other books to read once this one has finished. Just hoping that the overall cost is not too much.
"The books I have been reading have been thoroughly entertaining and the genres are varied and I believe they have something for everyone. Whether it be adventure, romance, Sci fi, paranormal, supernatural or fantasy, it's all here. Very enjoyable. Although it is frustrating waiting on new chapters and running out of coins. The books can be expensive."
"Some of the books are really good, some with a few spelling and grammar errors. Can turn out to be very expensive per book, but worth it if its good. I would like to see some longer chapters, especially in the slower sections when nothing really happens."
Honestly like the app. It has a great variety of good books. It doesn't have a good variety of ways to earn sufficient points compared to the other reading apps. I'm an avid reader. I tend to run out of points fast. However this is an expensive hobby on this app. Other apps give you discounts for opening multiple chapters or the entire book. I appreciate the app gives daily points for logging in. I believe that it should increase with loyalty. Ex. After a month you should gain 5 more points.
"I love this app. Being able to see whats available from various authors. Two things I feel could be better. 1. Change how authors are paid so we do not waste a load of money for repetition. I would love my current favorite book, Charlie Wade, if the author didn't keep repeating the same things. I know this is due to being paid for word count. 2. Make it cheaper for us to read the books or switch to a donation platform since authors can scribble anything to lengthen the book."
I love the books on this app. They are pretty amazing. However you can tell they are written by amateurs without editors as there are many errors. That being said it is still easy enough to read and they are great reads. It costs too much to read the books in my opinion though. I think I should be able to purchase by book instead of by so many chapters for x amount of money.
"Great quick easy read stories that really catch your attention & let you escape. I've opened about three of their books so far as I'm a brand new user and they stories are actually quite good and I am ana avid reader. I know it feels inconvenient to need the certain number of stars or points to keep reading because you are so into the book and then boom, it stops you.."
"GoodNovel has a wide variety of selections to choose from. I find myself reading 3 or 4 books at a time. I like the way there are constant previews of ""something new"". I do wish chapter size was more consistent with the rewards earned. Overall thumbs 👍"
"I absolutely love the novel Married at First Sight. At least I do it this point, if I could get deep enough into it to decide. My only problem is that you can't get enough! You read a couple of pages, then you're locked out unless you buy more. You have to log in again the next day and watch videos to get enough bonus points to read the next chapter, which is not very long at all. I want more per day! I spend more time watching the ads than I am able to reading!"
The app is really good but they don't have some books that's free so you're going to have to fill your coins up or buy coins. But they do have this one part that really like is that you can watch videos but you only watch like 3 time maybe. I mean if they have more videos where you can watch more degree the book that be awesome
"It's a pretty good app for reading fiction, but the token system to unlock subsequent chapters can be annoying, especially when you can only earn about enough tokens to read a couple chapters per day (which are short). It's not bad, but they have to make money somehow."
Interesting books and the readers are clear when they speak. Some are great with changing their tone to reflect the scene in the book. My only complaint is that I have been unable to just buy a whole book. I can only listen to individual chapters.
Great platform ! I have been reading some of the novels offered and have become a fan. The stories are very captivating and the characters are well developed. The only reason I didn't rate this a 5 out of 5 is the fact you have to earn/buy credits in order to progress with the stories. Basically if you don't want to spend money it works out to one free chapter a day.
"So I started reading, "" When his eyes opened"" and I really liked it. It's got me hooked. However their were several typos in the chapters. The only thing that bothers me is you have to keep paying money to read the book. I wouldn't mind If it were like a one time fee of $10 - $20 but It's too expensive to read the whole thing. I've spent 35 dollars so far but can't spend any more. So I guess chapter 180 is all ill be able to read. 😔"
"Great books, love the stories. I was shocked the first time I was prompted for payment to continue reading. I actually uninstalled the app. But after reading another review on this app, and found out that you can get points to read without paying, just not very many, I installed it again, now just reading stories slowly, but they really are great."
There are some really awesome stories. I do hate that with the free coins you can really only read one chapter a day basically unless you start reading multiple books but then I get confused. It's a easy app to use and no ads which is a plus.
"I love the ease of reading or listening. When it's crazy at home, I can toss the earbuds in and do daily chores, or I can read while lying in bed at night. I do think so of the voices could be better. I hate that I have to pay soooo much to continue the story. This is the only thing keeping me from listening or reading more often."
"All the stories read so far are awesome. If they don't hold my attention the first two paragraphs I usually discontinue reading them. My only complaint is the amount of coins you spend going into chapters and the chapters be short. If you're an avid reader this may be costly. Again, the stories are very intriguing."
I enjoy the books. The authors have the creativity to create a story you get addicted to. My only negative is that I pay too much for books with so many grammatical errors. Bad grammar kills great stories. I would adjust the cost or allow customers to get credits for their corrections.
This app isn't bad compared to others. It has a few a ways for you to earn points so you can open chapters. I find it's a lot easier than others apps that makes you play games to collect points first then wait till a couple of days before they're xferred to coins.... annoying!!🤯
I love reading the novel. Its very enteresting and enjoyable. It is my first time to read and subscribe and I can't stop myself reading it until the last available chapter. I hope the next time I open my phone I can continue to read the next chapter of the novel if I am not busy. I discovered that reading novels is a worthwhile past time activity. I want to read more stories from this app(Good Novel). I hope I can discover more beautiful stories that can tickle my mind and spirit while relaxing.
Love reading the books the chapters are good and a great read... but I don't like the price of coins or even needing coins. Should be able to read for free instead of having to buy or do other things to get coins. This is like playing games that have ads.
Overall experience with the app is pleasant. However I am not a fan of having to continue buying coins to read a full story. It should be much easier to also earn coins along with purchasing.
"I really enjoyed reading until the unexpected happen. I made payments to load the book and continue reading, only to get anotification that payment was incomplete and kept asking me to put the pin. Before i knew it i was billed three times with no novel loaded to read. I hope this will be resolved and my money refunded. Otherwise, i love the app so much and looking forward to reading more novels here."
"I stumbled across GoodNovel last week. I began reading one of their books and rekindled my love for reading. I had forgotten how relaxing it was to disappear in my imagination while reading. When I reached the limit of reading permitted, I explored another book that was just as intriguing. Now, I am checking in daily to read both books."
"Love the variety of books. This app has a large variety of books. If you're not in the mood for werewolves, then select a good romance novel. There are some chapters with misspelling but it's small things like he or she. But honestly I haven't found an app yet that doesn't have misspelling in the books."
The app works well with lots of books to choose from. Only the first few chapters are free and you only get enough coins to unlock one chapter a day otherwise you have to pay and it is on the expense side. 10$ gets you about 20 chapters compared to amazon or buying a book and getting to read the whole thing.
I love the app and the books it has available to read but I hate the fact that it takes so many coins to start a new chapter. Since the chapters take so many bonus coins I find it extremely irritating how there's not very many options to get more without purchasing them.
"Love this app! It's one of my favorites to read off of. The only reason I left 4 instead of 5 stores is I wish there was a way to download more chapters for a discount, like on other apps, then one chapter at a time. It ends up eating a lot more money than I'd like, even if the stories are worth it!"
The story I am currently reading is one of the best werewolf stories I have ever read. AND it is very well written. You can tell this one was actually proofread before it was published. That is one thing I hate about these apps. People try to just type and send. No proofreading. My one huge problem with all these apps is the cost. I spent over $20 on this one story alone and still have not finished the story.
"So far the all is decent, the book I am reading currently is good. However coins are kinda pricey, there needs to be Moe options on ways to earn coins. Books cost a lot of coins to finish reading them, I feel like I can purchase a book at a book store for cheaper but this does help with not having to go to the store....it would just be nice if there were more ways to win coins, and if u have to purchase coins u guys offer like explicit specials sometimes make things a bit cheaper"
"The novel I'm reading is good but I've never spent so much money to read a book! Every chapter costs 22 coins to read and the chapters aren't long. I'm now up to chapter 294 and no where near the end. The story keeps on going like the energizer bunny! I have spent over $70.00 so far and it's almost time to add coins. What a way to get rich off of your readers! I don't think any novel should cost more than $50.00 to read! If I have to go above $100 to read this novel, I'm uninstalling this app!"
"I like the stories, just annoying with the chapters being so small and requiring higher bonuses to open. Purchasing bonuses isn't viable either to finish a story, would cost hundreds and hundreds. And no one would spend hundreds just to read a story!"
"The app is exactly what you would think. It has a wide variety of books available. The bad part is it can take time to save up coins without spending money to ""top up"". Each chapter needs more coins for you to continue to read the book. It can get frustrating."
"For the most part I like this app. I did find a free book I liked. I was most of the way done and it kicked me back to the beginning and wanted me to pay per chapter to evn get back to where i was. Very disappointing. Unless you wait until you get free coins you will basically end up paying $40-60 for an unedited, grammatically incorrect book. If you are patient then you cam ready a chapter a day for free basically."
App is good. The books seem to be good so far. The coins needed to buy so 0often is frustrating. I'm low income and purchasing coins is almost impossible. Would love to see a better way to earn more coins.
"I like this app but kinda confused on how it works. I love the book I am reading but, I could have bought a paperback for what I am spending on this one book. I feel, this app should come with instructions. Maybe and I hope this helps other readers. Get back and give us some instructions and tell us how many coins we need to read one book instead of just teasing us."
The books are good. Love the different story lines but the chapters are to short for the points you need to read them and it doesn't always count all the time you are reading them to get to the next points.
"Love some of the novels, especially those that you can feel the uniqueness that the authors have placed in the story. The app in general are pretty easy to use just sometimes the cost of some novels can be very expensive."
"This app is okay like that you get to watch an ad to unlock chapters for a max of 2 chapters. The books on this app are so addictive to read. I wish each chapter wasn't 30-35 tokens cause that only equates to almost 20 dollars or more to be able to finish a book. Overall, it's a good app"
"The books are amazing, there are some great authors providing quality reading material. I do feel they could make coin purchases cheaper or have more ways to earn coins that is a big down fall and why I don't use the app more often."
"I enjoy reading several of the books that are available. Some of the authors should update a larger content, at times it seems that the chapter is small in comparison to what we pay to read them. A fair cost should be considered at all times and if an author doesn't complete the book the readers should be refunded part of what they paid. Overall pay attention to the comments and if under 100 chapters are available, wait until the authors have past that number before paying to read. Great books"
I'm really enjoying the novel when his eyes opened. The only downfall is having to pay so much to keep reading! Please make it cost less. I wouldn't mind watching ads as long as I could read more of the book after laying so much already!
This app has great books. I do t typically read like ever. But I'm hooked on this book . The only downfall is after so many chapters it requires you to have bonus coins or points to continue . That's real frustrating.
"I love the stories they have in this app! You can binge read in the beginning and then add money to your account to keep going strong or just take your time by earning points each day to read a little more. I have found free versions online with the same titles, but these are superior and more well written than those. There is also a partner app with GoodNovel for some of these books which also works on the same points concept."
I love the books but it costs way to way much!! You need to make watching the ads worth more coins ppl don't have that kind of money to spend just to read a few chapters then get frustrated because they have to buy more coins you literally get enough coins to read one chapter a day kinda sucks more ppl would read these if it didn't cost so much!!!
"Love the App- Needs Some Refining I'm currently reading a book that currently has 1600+ chapters. Yes, 1600! Purchasing coins can get quite expensive if you wish to keep up. I understand that authors have to make money, but I think there needs to be minimum standards that define a chapter. Minimum character counts would make it worthwhile for the reader and wouldn't inhibit the authors. I read 1 ""chapter"" that had 6 paragraphs and cost me 22 coins. Definitely one-sided benefit."
"Had a little trouble navigating the bonus points, but persistence and repetition helped. The stories are intriguing and one has the option to buy points are read for free after the updates."
I have had this app for a while. I love the stories on it. It does cost alot to get coins and it takes forever to earn them if you can't buy them. Would be nice to have more ways to earn coins to read the books fully.
"Honestly I absolutely love this app I think the stories in it are amazing I'm reading 2 at the moment ""Charlie Wade"" and ""when he opened his eyes"" I can't seem to figure out which one I like the most but I can't get through them fast enough I get to read one small chapter then run out of coins and being a single mum of 4 children it's hard to get money to buy the coins to continue reading the stories it seems to be the only time I get when I do get the few coins a day from watching the videos"
This app is really great. It gives free books to read every now and then. But when your about to read a book with the free option it will take about 20-35 bonus. I don't know about anyone else but I like to read a lot in one sitting. So just ready 1 or 2 chapters a day is for me. BUT either way this app is good 👍
I saw a clip of a book on Facebook and it pulled me in. Found the book on this app and wow. Providing you can look past some grammar and spelling mistakes it's great. It did lose a star for not being able to gain coins quicker unless you pay.
"GoodNovel, so far, has been great and definitely has great stories, and I do wish you could accumulate more coins faster without having to buy them all the time, also for them to have longer chapters."
"I have found some absolutely amazing authors on here. The cost can be a lot, you pay ""coins"" per chapter. Most books have 5-7 free chapters at beginning of the book. You can usually figure out by then if you want to read book. There are ways to earn coins for free, so if you don't want to spend $, earn coins & read that way. Some authors also have their books for purchase on Amazon, which is great."
So far pretty good app I do have to say I prefer the apps with a yearly subscription rate over the ones like this that you have to pay per chapter. Also need a better filter system at the beginning.
"Excellent stories. Great so. Only thing that I have a slight problem with is after a certain time you have to use points for each chapter, annoying at times but still a great still a great so"
I enjoy the stories. The editing is far and away better than other apps I have tried. I would like to see a subscription or free coins from games section added to allow more readers to enjoy for less of a financial burden.
Very enjoyable for the most part but most of the books seem to be never ending and almost a cash grab. I don't mind paying for some of a novel but to have to keep paying and paying and never getting the reward of an ending is very frustrating for your subscribers. I understand that it is up to the writers to choose the length of book but you control what books you purchase and the parameters around them. Length of book should not be thousands of chapters.
"I love this app. There are so many great novel on here,sometimes I find it hard to stop reading. The chapter can cost alot a times, but you can collect coins with daily check-in and other task."
I really enjoy reading on this app but find it a bit expensive. Use to have a random amount of points for different chapters. Now all the chapters cost 22 points. It also seems as if the chapters are shorter..
It was too good reading on good novel app . But lately it's become too tough to load ads to unlock chapters or even check in has also become too tough. We.r too busy to see loading processes by killing our time. So somehow its eating us readers
I am currently reading married at first sight. Lovely book so far. I wish there were more ways to earning free rewards to continue reading. I tend to use up all of the rewards earning with tie first 30 minutes of reading. I buy quite a bit but being on a fixed income my buying is limited. So earning more free rewards or making the points on the reward a little more than just one or two chapters(since they are kinda short) would definely earn a 5 star from me. That is my only complaint.
The books are very addictive to read. Its been really good to come back each Day and be able to read a little more. I have enjoyed the content and books chosen for me to try are suited to my tastes nicely.
"I absolutely love the variety of genres offered on this app! The cost compared to other novel apps is less expensive, but there are not as many opportunities to earn rewards."
"GoodNovel has a display of very captivating story line full of suspense. I felt like i was glued to the television in the way i visualised the story i was reading and wanted to know the outcome of the plot but it turned that as you are finishing a chapter more chapters are being added to it . In essence you can never finish paying for it. The down side is she is used for he, her for him and vise vasal creating confusion unless you are able to read between the lines."
"For me its a good app really, the novel is good & interesting to read for but the thing is,too expensive to read the whole story if you dont have enough coins you have to wait to earn in daily task. Too expensive to buy coins too but you cannot read the whole story full.. even the watch ads to read the story is gone too... So sad i want to read the story more but sadly i dont have much money to spend more.. hope you return the watch ads for all the user read more thank you"
"Good collection of interesting stories on all genres. I used to read 2 stories a day because of the coins, recently they introduced a affordable feature, watching ads between chapters,i could read all the books 2 chapters per book,now there is a issue,the ads feature seems to be stopped,this problem seems to be there for few days app would reset itself and ad feature would start,but now even after contacting customer service,i haven't got any response also the problem is still there!"
"I've been using goodnovel for a while now and I do love the books it just more ""expensive"" per chapter then the other apps I use to read books. Even so I feel like the cheaper ones don't have as good of Grammer in their books."
I have read acouple of chapters so far and it's seems like a interesting book. I'm very interested to learn of the agreement that involves Elle. The only thing I don't like is how expensive it costs to read. A normal book costs and average of 20$ as should these books.
"Absolutely looove it! But needs more ways to do missions to win free coins (more read time missions for coins + chapters read missions for more free coins) and also to increase the amount of free coins to be won day after day in check-in when continuous for 7 days (5 more than day before until reach 50 coins, after 7 days, restart to 15 coins day 1, and repeat). I've seen in other apps & its actually more fun I think"
"I enjoy the books but it takes so long to build up coins and if you were to purchase them, each book would be pretty expensive. I wish there was an easier way to earn more coins without paying out a lot of money."
Lower the coins for reading usage. I enjoy the books. I want to unlock the book not used 22 coins for a chapter. Your bonus each day should go up. Not each day same reward. There over 200 chapters. Be realistic with us. You want more usage from the readers then be reasonable. The books are great. Not to mention if i am in a book please continue to ask if we to use our bonus points don't just use them. Ask us.
"Very entertaining stories, not a big fan of the points system in order to progress in ny reading. But the points seem easy to accrue and its fun to retrieve them."
"I've found several books I've enjoyed, but honestly I've only managed to read two all the way through. Top tip, make sure the book is completed before starting it, because sometime the book just stops with the promise of an update or re-edit and never is. Also some authors need to learn to stop and stop stringing the book along, storylines can get very tedious and boring."
"Good books but they lied!!! The books aren't free... They cost credits or coins!!! The chapters cost between 20-45 credits or coins a piece!!! It's hard to get said credits/coins unless you make a purchase!!! I want a app that doesn't always cost money!!! I like good books, but I am not paying to read chapters!!!"
I like the app I just wish that sometimes it wouldn't automatically download the next chapter to sometimes I don't want to.It has really good books and and I like that they have More options to earn coins I just wish the chapter's word so expensive. That's that's the reason why I took a star
The app is good but I still have a problem with creating a business link as I'm directed to my news feeds on Facebook anytime I try to do that and don't know what else to do. Also the voice record status is a great improvement but please let us be able to pin the microphone while recording and also be able to forward voice records to our status as they are not possible to be copied and pasted. Thank you for looking in to my review
"Don't like that the status ring on the contact profile pic defaults to open the status instead of a prompt which should choose. It should even be a togglable feature in settings. Can't see a profile pic without opening status or the chat, exact things I'm very cautious of doing."
"SO DISGUSTING AND FRUSTRATING!!! This particular version is so poor in sending files via DOCUMENT attachment. As a photographer and Designer, I can't send more than one file to another person. WHY??? When I have thousands of files to send, do I have to keep sending it one by one???? Swears, This is absolutely disgusting AND frustrating. Please return it back to formal version."
Recently I found that BROADCAST message is delivered only to those receiver's who have saved sender's contact number in their contact list. For example - If sender is sending message to new and old client through BROADCAST then that message will only be delivered to those who have sender's number saved and those will not not get messages who haven't saved sender number in their contact list. Please fix this problem coz making group is not a solution here coz of privacy between clients.
No issues with the business app. Can you please put the feature to set away messages for specific day that it repeats or a specific period for example that it repeats over 2 weeks again and will send the away message.
Love this app since it can help me create the catalogue for the product. But I wonder is it possible to make the collection permanently? I ve created the collections many times and in several times somehow all my collections gone and I ve should create from the beginning. It would be great if I dont need to create the collections many times
This app is amazing.....really made it easy to manage a job....but it was working very well all this time until the recent update Im talking about sending someone multiple photos as documets at a time....now i can only send 1 at a time and its really boring.....i hope you can fix it very soon
"Hi. These days it doesn't work properly for example it shows the date like 1998 or before, also it doesn't shows the latest chat at the top... They go at the end of my chats, and the other problem, i cant save the contact directly from whatsapp, when i press add to contact it shows me just the number as it not saved, but when i check my contacts i see it saved but it doesnt show me the whatsapp account of it."
"One word for WhatsApp Business: superb. It's been great using the app. Although voice calls come with voice delays and a little hiccups here and there, using the WhatsApp Business app has been a beautiful experience. I'd love to have more fonts on my status. Four is pretty limiting."
"Great app and functioning. I would love it if it is possible that after your download a document and someone deletes it from their download, the document or file stays in your phone rather than looking for how to go and extract it and keep somewhere else. Not everyone has enough space. Thanks. Such a great app for free."
"The app is good, but after updating I'm unable to send multiple document files at once. if i have to send for example 50+ documents I have to select them one by one, which means 50 times. too much time is consuming. 😒 kindly fix that."
Good and easy to use interface. Only suggestion is to make it like telegram which doesn't require data to be used on phone.. As this would save the problems of phones hanging .Secondly there should be a feature which shows in how many groups you are admin. This would be very much helpful I believe.
"very handy app. but you know, there are situations when several people write to you at the same time and you need to convey the same information to all of them. so could you add a function : write to multiple contacts. *I select several contacts, click on the additional (three dots) and select * write to several contacts *."
"Poor in synchronizing with web, chats are not available on web and other linked devices. Poor chat backup mechanism. Slow browsing while backing up chats. Updates required: 1) Enable communities in Whatsapp 4 Business as well, just like simple Whatsapp. 2) Scheduled messege/post for business related stuff and reminders, so that one can done whole day work in one time. 3) Enable sending/forwarding messages to the chats with common labels. Kindly must consider these user requirements. Thanks"
"Problems maybe with this new update (Android) It always gives and error saying ""Whatsapp Business keep stopping"" and this is becoming a serious problem, as I'm working in real-estate, and sometimes I have to be on the road and continue a conversation with a costumer which becomes impossible. I have to rely on the web access, I just can't survive any longer."
"Overrall, I love the app and the features, but since my last update, I have been unable to view people's statuses that were uploaded when I'm offline even when I eventuallyhave an active network, likewise my own status updates don't get views until I turn on my data... I really don't understand this feature and don't think it's cool at all, I hope something can be done about this."
I love this awesome corresponding as well as sharing app. It is better than any other this type of apps because it's very simple interface and it can operate very ordinarily by anyone who operates it. But sometimes there is a connection problems.
There's something wrong with the status update on the Galaxy S23 Ultra. After uploading the status photos look desaturated compared to what they were looking in the gallery or while uploading and also after selecting the filter I am unable to select the 'None' filter that buttons seems to be not working
"My Shortcut Business Tools, had a bug, so it cant send a teks + picture message to ilustrate quicker to my customers. I use Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e Runing on Android 11. Lately it wont work to share shortcut with picture alongside text. I used and updated to the last version app. Please fix the bug whatsapp, my fingers ache all over the screen"
When the person you are calling is offline or not able to reach then why the caller listens the bell ringing. It should clearly tell that person is not reachable at the moment. Though there is difference in display showing 'calling' or 'ringing' but it's confusing for some.
"Nice application for business but I will like the management in their subsiquent update of this app to provide options for alternative phone numbers and emails to receive otp incase when u lost your phone line you use to open this app, so dt we can recovered it back, Have lost my business app for 2 times now due to this after building it for several years & I lost my line I was unable to recovered it back I will be very delighted if my request can be granted. Thanks u for your quick respond."
"Hi. I have to deal many customers because of my job. And many of them don't reply so I have to message them again and again everyday. Everything was working perfect before. 👌🏻 But now after copy pasting when I messaged 20 customers , after that I am not able to message anyone. My messages stop delivering and a red sign pop up like this ❗ If you can help me solve this problem. I will appreciate it.😊"
"This app is not working properly when using in Dex mode in Samsung Tab S7. The area where we type in whatspp is not visible,we can see only after we click send button, so we will not be able to see what we are typing , as typing area goes below screen edge, may be due to non adjustment of resolution according to screen size of Tab, So request you to please solve the problem ASAP"
"Please let all unread messages be on the top of the list. Love the new audio status innovation. I always looked forward to it and happy it's finally here. The labels too, a very good innovation. Kudos👍"
The WhatsApp business app is good and very easy to use. I love the features it came with especially the quick replies option allowing us to save time. I do however have a bit of a problem with the away automatic messages. It would be better if away messages are only sent when my phone doesn't have a network connection then the greeting message sent as soon as my phone connects to the internet. Thank you.
"Whatsapp is a good app for communication and business... it would be more better if you add two following features: One is of ""schedule messaging"", means i want to text a person tomorrow at so and so time... Second one is ""reminder option"", means i received a message or photo etc but i want that whatsapp would remimd me this message at so and so time... Thanks"
"The app is good for both audio and video calls, with just minimum megabytes. It is also important in sharing documents, photos, connecting with organizations, and groups amongst other.. Thanks for such a unique and useful app."
"So far the app has been a great success in business and personal usage. However, I like a possibility where as a caution, I can be able to suspend, ban or restrict a member of my group from posting or commenting for a period of time when he/she violates the rule. you have similar function on Facebook groups. 2. Pls reduce ads fee charge. Thanks"
Experience is amazing... Just a suggestion could you add a feature whereby group chat can be separated from the ordinary single chats.. it's really hard to locate some groups or a specific detail that one is looking for....
It made our dialy business works easier ...but from few days having some slight glitches....unable to send using other apps like Dropbox....screen blinking.... Hope a solution (if there is a problem really in App) is on its way...
"Nice app. But if there's an option for determining if a person has saved your contact, that'll be very much apprecaited. Secondly, can a search option be introduced for customers who intend to search through the Whatsapp catalog with a product name?"
"I really appreciate the updates. Every new update brings about a better changes, now WhatsApp businesses make it's more easier to find customers around the web. You can pronounce what you can type in the app will type it. Recordings makes easy here. There's no need trying to figure out what you want to find you just need a date or a letter in what you want to find and WhatsApp will fish it out for u. we are hoping the new coming updates be of better help to our experiences"
"This app is great but i need an adjustment on the voice message button, make it bolder or move it to center, my samsung s10+ have a curved edge screen, i can't tap and hold the voice button well."
"The new update changed alot of things I can't type & attach pictures Ive to post the pic & attach a message to it, which isn't convienent because the words becomes all muggled up. On group chats, once u reply the first tag all others are lost because u can't find them again"
"Hi everyone, in all case WhatsApp business is so great. But my wish for the time being is that you the developers add the new features like the possibility to forward or share our vocal on our status. When I'm in my chats, you have to give us the opportunity to forward the vocal message from our chat to the status. Thanks for understanding."
"Its a great app but compared to those fake apps , the imitations of whatsapp those guys are serious about customer satisfaction. I suggest the original whats app would copy a few of the cool setting found on the fake one, for example sending a msg to an unsaved contact. Sometimes you need to send a quick msg to a client without having to save them in your phone book."
Having problems with the app in Samsung Dex mode. Text input field is cut by the window and cannot easily type messages. So annoyed by this. Any solutions?
Its a very good app. Considering there are always new updates. But the feature that disables your keyboard dictionary is not really helpful.
WhatsApp Messenger and whatsapp Business both reduces the quality of images & videos while sending these types of files. Files quality becomes reduced with file size be reducing. Please fix this bug. Files size should be reduced but quality shouldn't be reduced.
"It's a nice app, but the issue I have is that I might have an active data connection but the app will fail to notify me of new messages and it will also fail to give my away or greeting messages unless I open the app. Personally, I don't like opening the app always. I prefer messages showing up on my status bar and I drag down to reply them. Please update for enhanced usage. Thank you."
"WhatsApp is now nice and super cool, but it'll be better if editing already sent message is added to it, instead of deleting and retyping, one should be able to edit after it have been sent"
Just linked my account to another phone and I'm unable to send status except I use the primary account. I'd really appreciate the next update fixing that for convenience. Thank you.
"Broadcast list size should be increased. One small retail business can have some thousand customers and according to broadcast list, one has to create more than 40 broadcast lists to reach them daily, weekly or monthly."
"It's a nice app, easy to communicate, and receiving of massage for s very fast, the annoying part of this app is we cannot reply through status,I love this app especially when you updated it"
"It's good and easy to use, but a feature to pin status to top of status page would be really helpful."
"I'm facing a bug where I cannot send multiple doc files, only the first selected document is being sent even when multiple files are selected"
The latest version is really good though it delays n bringing up new messages and recording while long pressing the voice icon z hectic for some people
"The app is ver good, i was recommended by my friend. But the problem is my account is blocked. Can I get any help restoring it."
"Everything is fine ...just i don't understand one thing last week update latest version ,after that notification sound is not working,i have checked settings and all , popup notification showing,and vibrating also but no sound....why ??"
I hope WhatsApp team sees this; I will like you to add a single delete button option which when clicked can wipe away all status at once to enable u start a new status 4d business of d (new) day and not deleting them one by one. App is cool and easy to use.
Please PLEASE add support to the galaxy watch 5 to listen to and send voicenotes. It is killing me not being able to do so as I am always busy and always on the run.
"Great features but 50 quick reply isn't enough please increase the allowed number of them. Also if you can add a chatbot it would be great, or just add the choice to add questions and answers with the welcoming message. Thanks"
I can't seem to use the filter option for status updates. It isn't highlighting the filters
Typed a message in my business group for 30 mins after looking up many pointers from different pages of a pendency note to create a crisp list. Selected all to copy and tapped on paste by mistake. A single line copied earlier wiped the whole struggle of 30 mins. Feeling devastated to realise there is no way out. Are we really living in 2023?
"Some of the setting have bugs, such as if a same contact, you can't see the person profile photo or so. But in other whatsapp can appear. Please fix"
I've been waiting for WhatsApp ads but I don't understand why the least I can pay for an ad is $500????? That's too much. Atleast bring it down to $30 or something. Spending $500 at one go for an ad is horrendous to me!!!!
My expirince is better and keeps learning threw you!!! I would say that it would be good to continue to learn new ways and things in our life!!!
"It has always been good, but today aftwr i logged in to WhatsApp web, my app on mobile started crashing, i uninstall n reinstall twice, switched off my device but nothing is helping..."
Suddenly don't get thumbnail previews when attaching documents anymore. Voicenotes come out blank for the recipient. Please fix and update soonest!
"The app is Awesome tho not until recent updates just changes some certain things. Onlike the previous status font that someone can read from a distance, the new one is too small that someone could read through it. Please if the font pattern can be changed back to the old one. And again the new features of having over 2000 plus members in a group is not included in the WHATSAPP BUSINESS VERSION. If you can add it up too. THANKS"
"add text in edit images is not working. whenever we try to add text, it closed whatsapp and restarts the app."
"I've been working with this version Business for about a year. It's worked smoothly..it covers most of my basic needs..file sharing, Chat, video conf coordination, calls, etc...it has also been fairly good for managing my contacts...I use it in a simple way though, but it has been really useful for all my communications..."
"It's a nice app and I've enjoyed it for a while now but I recently noticed that my voicenotes don't get delivered, immediately I finish recording it and I hit send,it just disappears. Not really sure if it's a me thing but I hope the developers will help sort this out."
"It's really good but unlike facebook you don't meet new people, and although I know that it's the it was programmed, still it can get boring when you have no one to talk to. And secondly it kinda nullifies my data connection, I don't get notifications for new messages."
", I had to upgrade my phone to a newer version and bought a new one for the same. For that, I have transferred all the data's as well as whatsapp from my old phone to the new one. Astonishingly, I can read and send all the messages on two phones at the same time. _*In your platform, it was said that all the messages and calls are end to end encrypted, no one outside of this chat not even WhatsApp can read or listen to them.*_ And I don't understand how come this happened? Luckily, I haven't"
It's an all round great tool for organizing your business. I'd suggest you download Whatsapp for privacy. The call feature needs a lot of work and the status should give more options to edit video and audio.
"Good app, but please there should be a few seconds allowance, maybe 1 or 2 seconds before a call that is not received is shown on the receivers phone as a missed call, because sometimes the call is a mistake"
"Its good and easy to use, no need to scroll when checking how many pplehave viwed my statuses, it autonaticaly writes the digits below the status"
"I'm using Before 2 years it's good but please add Payment gateway payment receive dairect form customer to bank account using UPI , Cradit/ Dabit Cards This is missing in this application . & Upgrate Catalogue feature Thanks"
"I would've rated this app 5 star but no ! It doesn't deserves it, checking messages is so stressful when you have so many new messages after check each one you would have to go back before checking the next one ,it would be better if you can check new messages simply by scrolling"
"Big hands for developers for such stunning app...A suggestion which may make it more popular... I think if developers update a feature about deletions of messages like in GB Whatsapp ,where receiver have authority for save messages sent by other people."
Highly recommends for saved or collection features. We cannot find docs or media easily we are facing a big lost of timing.
"Very interesting and easy to go App. I will suggest to the developers to add the catalog section an option that would enable the business owner to see the number of views from potential customers. It could be made daily views, weekly, monthly and yearly. This could help the business owner understand how people visit their catalog. Thanks."
"Imust say, my Whats app Business is great... But what would b even better.. Firstly, if I can select unread group msges. Secondly, if I can select when forwarding which lable of contacts to forward all to at the same time. Otherwise SUPER awesome."
"Overall, I'm really impressed with the app. It's actually a nice initiative that comes with the labels in order to differentiate completed & uncompleted transactions. However there should also be a way to add paid amount and amount remaining to be paid with the labels. It'll help accountability & make sense a whole lot. Please look into this. Then I'll give a five-star rating & bring referrals too!"
App is too good but I found a major problem in Catlouge option .....there is no search button ....I mean I m dealing in 1000 products I have to scroll down 999 item to reach particular product
"The app is quite convenient for both communication and advertisement. However, I only have this against it: It's updates come later after the Whatsapp non-business version has updated. But overall it's really good."
"The app is overall great, very easy to use. It would have been nice to have message edit option. Thanks for making our lives easy!"
"Hi, I am facing an issue while tagging a person in group that become ineffective after few seconds. Can anybody tell me what is the issue and how it will resolved. I have checked my what's app business is udpate as of now."
I enjoyed using the application as it make it easier for me to share my products and advertise. Will really appreciate it if you can include a search functionality to the catalogues. Thank you
"It has always been good but I think the new update has issues, it hasn't loaded any message all day. I even restarted my phone. Take note that my other apps are working fine. Can you please look into this?"
Overall it is good but there should be option to forward message more than 5 contacts at a time (atleast 50 numbers at a time) and broadcast list without saving contact numbers... please work on it
"So good App!! Although it most likely to be updated for a few time, Still works perfectly and add new modifications when you will update it That is likely for example it double the profile like FB rather than IG. Seem to be better ❤️ compared to others WhatsApp"
"There more number of clicks required to change the label. First you have to select the contact, then click on label symbol and then select the label. It would be great if I can do the same in less clicks. Thanks"
My issue with this application is updating everytime. While i need to update it every month or two months. Its too frequent. Please try and reduce it. Though the application is supervisor
"Pop-up Notification is a very tremendous thing. But, its not available on current Version of Android. Plz restore and enable Pup-Up Notifications."
Everything is good but you guys can add a feature which can let people control notifications time say like the notification can only come during 9-5 or something this would help a lot
"Great App. But can you please separate group chats from individual chats? Also, can you create a section in the catalogue that contains information about each item that can be seen only by the user?"
WhatsApp Busines is very good and convenient in business transactions. It checkmates the people that makes contact in your App. Is conversations. I love it.
"The new WhatsApp business Is very nice but it's reduce views. If you post status and someone on your cantact list is not online, they won't see your status when they come online."
"I love it in everyway I must say ,but recently it's been giving me a tough time.i have an active data but it fails to notify new messages, untill after an hour or two please look into it"
"The app is nice especially for business owners but I feel another feature should be added. The feature of being able to pin status just like chat pinning. If that can be added, I think it will look more nice."
Could you add a tag feature on Whatsapp? To tag or mention people on status updates to notify them. That'll be really cool. The app has been great so far.
Maybe if we have the option to make the catalogue regular one right now or 2 blocks (image) so it's easier for us to look the image and when there's many items it's easier to see each item. And a search in catalogue so we can find the item instead scrolling many items just to find it.
"Well I would love if the developers could add a function where you can block your contact's status from being visible to you rather than the mute function alone. You'd have to mute all over again, those statuses that you don't like their contents or they post explicit images; after reinstalling WhatsApp without backing up, also the muted statuses are still visible, only that is hidden. Apart from that, you guys are doing a great job and I'll gladly give 5 stars if you can work on my complaint"
"The experience has gone good so far, but I've been waiting for a feature eagerly that is, it will be good if the user can select his contacts, who can see you online and who cannot coz I don't want a few people can see me online while I am using what's app, In short a button is needed to make an individual show offline.. add, if we like to change someone's DP on our device, the way we like 2 see the DP of the person we are in touch, coz sometimes that person doesn't change the DP for long."
"Hi team, App is really great and useful. It will be much helpful if you can create a direct message button without saving a number. It will be much helpful. In many of the businesses we don't need to save each and every number to text some one. Please add this button It will surely help many of the businessman and whatsApp users."
Serves well for effective communication across the globe. Super excited for the enhanced tool included to enable admins delete others' messages in group chat. The business profile tools are wonderful and the linkages between other platforms such as Facebook and Instagram makes it great .. But the ads are too expensive to purchase or create.
Delete option we stay long time in page pls updates to fast of second and don't show Delete bar in page 4 second 5 second it's long time stay on page updates boring your app
"This is a very great app, convenient and easy to use. The only problem I have is that one can't have a video call with the front/back light on in a situation where there's no light in the house, unlike the normal Whatsapp where that's possible, or is there a way to activate it in settings?"
"Very similar to VLC with a few extra in player controls. I got it mainly because it lets you sort by date in the file list. My main disappointment with this app and VLC is that you can select multiple files in the playlist, you can only move them up or down one at a time. The ads so far seem minimal. I'd buy it if I could reorder multiple selected files. Update: Just saw the downloader included. Works as good as my standalone on one site so far. A definite plus."
Coming from MX Player. Thought I would give this a try again. Works fairly well but i need the ability to set an audio delay when using Bluetooth headset. MX Player has a global Bluetooth headset delay that most players (including this one) does not have that I can find. You can set the Bluetooth delay for individual videos but not globally for all videos. Otherwise good app.
"It's an excellent video player with lots of good features, but I watch lectures that are about an hour or two long. Many times when I leave the app and let it play in the background then go back to the video, an ad will play, then when the ad is over the video I was watching restarts and I have to find my place again. very annoying, especially with such long videos."
"Good player with glitch. When listining to music and putting the timer on, the player stops as soon as the screen turns off. I adjusted all the setting, with same result. The logical thing is, for the player to continue playing until the end of the set time then shuts off by itself. One more issue, when playing music, the player plays next song automatically, how to prevent that from happening?"
"Very easy to use and decent placement of ads so it's not too clunky. Only used it for 5 mins so far. So this is just my first impression. Wish that the playback of the video was more smoother. Didn't see an option to vary the frame rate for video quality. EDIT: The videos are local. I know that varying frame rate speed is dependent on the original video quality. Maybe for videos that doesn't have that as an option, there was a way to gradually increase playback speed."
"That fixed it thank you. But there are lots of minor bugs rn. The refresh icon just sits there when its done, depending on whether the app is opened from the icon, the recents page, or the pop up it will play from various points or freeze up or refuse to fast forward. ff 10 sec just resets it to where it was when i hit pop up play. Its weird. S10+ still top of the line for usability and trust overall. I dont even mind the ads. Depending on where you choose the vid from, start point is a gambl"
"EDIT: Subtracted one star because when I exit the app and then go back in to play my video again it restarts from the beginning even when the ""resume video"" setting is turned on. I watch long trainings with this player and I want them to start up where I left off reliably. Will change rating when I see this fixed. Original: Best video player hands down. So good that I purchased it just to support those who made it. Thank you! P.S. You should buy it too."
"I've been using it for about a year on my Kindle Fire. My nitpics are: 1. I put favorite vids in separate folders by artist. There isn't continuous play (that i can find) between videos within the same folded. A vid plays then stops when done, then i have to manually select the next one in the folder, etc. 2. Access to EQ (and bass boost & virtualizer) should be 1 click away, take up less screen space and not cause the video to stop playing. It's hard to EQ vid audio if there's no audio to hear."
"In settings Manage ScanList I expected a way to tell the app where only to scan for files. All that exists though is two tabs called video and music, with no options to do anything. I could find no other place in the app to control where it looks for media files. I don't want the app to touch my music and I only want it to look in two places for video files. Correction: eventually the Manage ScanList did list all the folders for found media files. It just took awhile. I'm using a Tab S7+. Other apps scanned media much quicker. I can now click Hide to remove any unwanted canned folder."
I say I have a Galaxy S8. A friend set me a short video from an iPhone that I could not play. Downloading this app enabled me to be to play the video as well as locate old videos stored on my SD card that I had not seen in a very long time. The only thing it lacks is the ability to share to another folder or section or to upload to social media. Over all I have been pleased with it.
"WAY better than my last video player. Only problem is if you pause the video for 5 minutes or less, it disappears from the notifications dropdown menu and you have to manually turn it back on in the app. It's a little irritating. Edit: didn't expect the devs to actually see this so I will apologize for the ""irritating"" comment. It's actually a pretty good app and really reliable."
"SGS5: Some video and audio extensions not supported. Casting to Roku also not supported. Full page ads are a NO-NO. Good way to have people reject something that otherwise is a very good app. Oh one other thing, the icon on the screen is in the way. Hard to or can't read the bottom line(s) of the directory."
"This app is good, although I have a couple things I would like to recommend. 1. I think there should be a scroller on the side to make things easier when navigating through videos 2. I think the equalizer should show up ad an option to use while watching a video or playing as audio And last of all, could you guys make it possible to play a single video as audio and give the option to loop it?"
"The subtitles are in the middle of the screen in every video I play and have been for about a year+ and there's nothing in the subtitle customization menu to relocate them. The only tools I show are size, color and background. Where's the position tool you indicate in the settings should be in the menu? Been waiting for you to add an option addressing this in the updates, but nothing yet. So, would you plz add that option giving us the ability to locate them where we need/want? Thx!"
"So much better than MX player. It's reliable, and the interface is so much more user-friendly than MX especially when in pop up mode (you can review or advance by 10 seconds!). I wish there was a pro version with no ads. That's my only complaint."
"My fav player for last many years. But after the last 2 updates, the cast function disconnects frequently. Also, whatever is the player at, it starts from start. Please fix this, I'm using older version to use it now"
"1)Add a setting to disable gesture volume control and gesture brightness control. 2)Add setting to set a default Playback speed for all vids. I always play videos in 0.50x speed and have to select 0.50x every time. I would like to save a step and my time by having a setting to remember playback speed. 3)Add a ""remember orientation"" option for EACH video. I have videos that are better in landscape than portrait and I want the player to remember the orientation on a PER VIDEO basis"
Oh My God .I just Love it. I can use my costmization in theme .You know dev I just kicked out other media players. It now my default media player. Just a little bit slow to open otherwise superb. Love you guys good work. Fix app open is around 3 to 4 sec.make it more fast. Thanks ❤️
It's Easy to use app performance is good no problems . It have all the necessary features and very minimum number of ads pop up which is very few compare to the other players
"Acting like a virus!!! Phone started acting up after download. Everytime I'd turn my phone back on, the ""XPlayer"" app was always the first screen I saw. The name of the app in the Playstore, doesn't match the name on the icon after downloading, which will say ""XPlayer"". Then it began mimicking my package installer. Although the icon would say ""XPlayer"", a box would pop up saying ""Package Installer stopped working"". Then I tried to delete it, but couldn't. BE WARY!!!"
The rating is four because when I switch that Playback speed the pitch of Voice get fluctuated and can't get the quality of the voice or audio.
"Best in the world .... Just wanted a download option in the download. Whenever I try to download a file , it doesn't start downloading. !! Devlopers should come up with a cure !!"
Would get a five if the play button would register my rapid taps for when I want to stop at a specific moment and funny enough it used to until now what happened?
"Plz add an option ""Long press to play at 3x""................. ""Resume: continue playing from where you stopped"" feature doesn't work, plz fix"
"It has all nice features in different video players all together, with those of MX player inclusive, the double tapping features for backward, play, and forward, it has the speed adjuster, and you can also download subtitles for your videos"
"Decent app easy to use, would be better if could permanently change the format of a video file."
Great app. Does almost everything I want from it. Been using it for a few weeks and no problem so far.
"Excellent performance and very interesting to use because of its graphics , visuality and manual functions ....."
Ok.. You Should Change The A & B Looping To An A & B Repeat Line.. So We Can Move The A & B Back & Forth Sort Of Like Playit App Haves If Ya Put That It'll Be Perfect.
App is awesome but I wish it had the capability to stream/ browse content from my PC aka DLNA support.
Long press to play at 2x speed should be more optionally till 8x as same as in 'PlayIt' Android player Thn my rating will be 5 star. Rest all is best
works pretty good with chrome book it only stops once or twice a day...
"I've been using this app for years and have not experienced any issues, one of the best so far. I updated severally before now, but realized that after updating to the recent version, every of my videos from the app became double. First, thought it was a setting issue, but even at the setting, there is no option to get rid of each video been double. Can't wait to hear from the team concerning this issue."
"Works, however the advertising makes it cumbersome to use. If you ever try to pause a video, or sometimes even skip forward, you find most of the screen taken up by an ad, blocking about half of the pause and other buttons and making it hard to resume. Doesn't work on my phone (lg power 2) for h265, but nothing else does either. Likely a hardware problem. UPDATE: 4 stars with the new ad location which makes it easy enough to pause, resume etc a video. One of the better video apps for Android."
"It's a really good app with a nice interface, lots of video options and smooth sensitivity. My only problem is that when i fast forward a video with Bluetooth headphones on, the frame rate drops noticably for a second or two, then return to normal. Aside from that it's perfect. I really hope they fix that in a future update."
"4 stars because Subtitles are an issue. Just colour and text size isnt enough. The default font is too thin and difficult to read, especially on anime where the video has similar flat colours (as opposed to real life videos). No body wants huge subtitle texts, and small is just too thin and hard to read. Needs to have the ability to change font as well to at least some of the basic ones like Arial, tohama, etc., and option to bold and/or italics"
"Hello dear developers, You guys have made such an All in 1 easy to use app. All functions are smooth and sleek. I would surely have given 5 stars but I'm getting one small issue in this app. When I forward or backward the video by tapping twice(double tap) on the screen, the video screen turns green distributed in some pixels like cubes for a few seconds and then the screen comes back to normal. And also it applies to some specific videos but to my surprise in other apps the video's running👍."
This seems like a really good media player. I upgraded to paid version straight away to support the developer. I would suggest a memory function on the equalizer so you don't have to keep adjusting it for each movie. Then it would be 5 stars. Also occasionally freezes for a split second at random on some MP4 files. Still a great app though.
"Possibilities wise this is great player. Problem is, then fast forwarding is not smooth, makes video lag and often dissynchronises video-audio. It happens on my phone and my tablet. Especially when you jump forward multiple times. Would be great, if you could fix it cause the rest of options is good and it really does play all the formats. Thanks!"
It would be great if it played videos according to folder sort order rather than always alpha sort
"This is an awesome video player with complete set of features, but unfortunately ads are placed at the worst place, in the middle of the screen when video is paused. Most of the times we pause to see details, to read long subs, or just to take a breath of relief after intense scenes. So you may have to move where the ads are displayed."
"It's a good video player app, but there are some drawbacks like loop option which isn't in the shortcut on the top, I have to go into settings to change it. And this application has full access to the internet, for what? Advertisement? is this application safe and is there a guarantee that private files are not taken silently without the user's consent? The rest is okay and good."
"This is an excellent video player, but I have a few complaints. Since last update, when I advance or backward the video, it lows the playing speed for a few seconds, and sometimes I have to adjust the audio sync cause it happens to be a bit forwarded to the images (this doesn't happen with VLC, that's why I know that problem is on this app)."
Make the audio player play without looping; play a single track or song and return to list.
Actually this is the most satisfactory video player platform I've come across so far. So easy to use and alot of cool features too.
Sometimes you play a video and the audio is faster than video itself. Which does not make someone enjoy.
"Amazing app but after the most recent update, double tap to seek has been added, for me thats more of an annoyance then anything as i keep hitting it on accident when i actually mean to just pause the video and there is no option to turn it off. I prefer to double tap any where on the screen to pause the video. Therefore, can you please add an option to turn off double tap to seek."
Very good app. One detail: it's possible to delay the subtitle?
"I really like this app, no glitches. But my only problem is that once the music playing goes off you can't continue from where you were and you have to play all over again which makes you listen to a song twice. I would really love for it to have resume play like it's video play feature."
"Great app. You can select which file provider to be used when loading the subtitles, which means you can load the subtitle from any media (internal storage, sd card, network drive - if you use es explorer). Downside - when starting the app on it's one, it has locked orientation to Portrait mode. Also, the drawer elements cannot be accessed using up-down controls. This means it is hard to change the setting if you use it on a android/tv box."
"The app functions well enough, and the interface whilst viewing content is nice. However, I would prefer the default menu to navigate through my phone's directory, for both video and audio files, with clear avenues to playing media from cloud storage locations. Redesign the menu in this fashion, add some fun filters and effects, display album artwork coreectly, the way that your Music Player does, and this would quickly become my default choice for media playback. I'd even pay to remove the ads."
This is super for looking movies but in background music 🎶 the sounds is breaking so please solve this
Good option for low device for all audio and video format
Nice!!! Video player with many set of features..
"This is a good app...a relatively satisfying one. I love that it has the option for background play. Having said that, could you place an option where we can play only the videos we select? I don't see that option, and I don't want to chug through all my music videos all the time or have to place them in another folder"
"so far the app works as i expected it to, and the ads are not intrusive. i have run into an issue however, since i originally looked for video player which would let me create a playlist with music videos on it, and then play those on shuffle. i cant seem to find a feature that would do this, although there seems to be option to play the audio track of a video on shuffle. edit: what i was going for was to play video files from a list, on shuffle. not just their mp3 tracks.i dont mind running app"
This is one of the best video players for android. The only problem I have is that the screen rotation button disappears -I think it happens when I use the split screen feature while watching a video- and I have to leave the video and come back if I want it to show up again. I hope you fix this issue soon.
"Hello developer, i love this vide player maybe it's the best out there but can you remove the black blinking flash at the end of a looped video it's so annoying, it desynchronizes the video making it look choppy maybe if you could remove the black blink at the end of a looped video maybe the loop would be more smooth. Thanks so much!!!!!"
"I really like this as I can listen and watch any video that I can download, but if you download a song that's +15 minutes it automatically uses the bookmark feature, making it so that you can keep track of where you left off. This is useful for audio books but not for music, I wanna listen to it all the way through. So is there a way to turn off the bookmark feature for songs of my choosing?"
Need to add screen toch pause option and pause automatically after incoming calls or alarm snooz
"This app is so good,you can also download a subtitles from it"
"Hello dear developers, You guys have made such an All in 1 easy to use app. All functions are smooth and sleek. I would surely have given 5 stars but I'm getting one small issue in this app. When I forward or backward the video by tapping twice(double tap) on the screen, the video screen turns green distributed in some pixels like cubes for a few seconds and then the screen comes back to normal. And also it applies to some specific videos but to my surprise in other apps the video's running"
An issue with a download will pop up every now and again. Overall a good experience and reliable app
"Pretty great and simple app. Although I wish the UI was a bit more professional rather than Simple. Also sometimes the Brightness and Volume doesn't get saved, if I close the app and then open it again to see my video. Update: Yes, ""Remember Brightness"" only remembers sometimes, while rest of the time, it doesn't. Also, I have some 4K videos on my phone, but this player plays them all choppy. I can't even change the Decoder to HW, it stucks at SW. REPLY: Can't change decoder in only 4K videos."
"Few ads. More or less free. Background play. Great theme options! Streams, too. Found this media player after numerous searches and downloads of media apps, so I can safely say it is one of the best amongst many. The home page interface could be better. Why are my Chrome files which I saved on SDcard missing?? Auto search doesn't bring up any result, so I tried searching manually for them in Directories but I when I tap on a file I keep getting a prompt: ""Unknown file"". How can I fix this?"
Awesome video app but take way too much time to open the application
"I'm really grateful for this app because it plays VIDEO_TS files (or whatever its called) from my memory stick. I tried using VLC android app player on my chromebook for the same thing and it wouldnt work at all, so really happy about this app. The only issue is is that it skips the menu for the chapters of the videos entirely, and for some reason it only plays the videos in 11 second loops? This is annoying when youre trying to navigate a 50 minute video, 4 stars, but I might try no ad version."
The player is good but when I stop the video a ad show
This is a great video player. Loving it. The way it sets up videos makes it easier for you to find any video you are looking for quickly. It has pop up play meaning u can watch videos while using any other app. U can download subtitles of any movie u want using this app. U can even play music from this app.
"No doubt it's one of the best ""Video Player"" than others. But here i noticed a problem about the sound of the video. The sound of this app is very low than others video players. Whenever i play a video i have to increase the volume. Please fix it."
"The player is always very good but the recent update have one big issue. When the next video auto play, the embedded subtitles went missing. Unless I return to the playlist and click in again then the subtitles shows up. Just Abit of inconvenience. Hope this will be solved."
"Works and has Chromecast support. The only future missing for me is to have multiple sources for Subtitles. Acestream support would be amazing, with Chromecast support. Update: Still using this app, bought the ads away to support them. But here are my annoyance with the app. Chromecast works well but it doesn't track the timestamp when you stop watching. Meaning that you have to remember where you stop watching. Another is that you can't download subtitles from the file manager."
"I'd give this a 4.5, best vid player I've seen ever, foucuses on the most important point which rest of players didn't vid playing, with other apps the rewinding feature always has bugs that make sound freeze at some repeats as well as not always accepting rewinding (no details needed), my problem: it just needs folder sorting system since vids are only sorter in one method. 2nd point it'd be great if you could do some work on music organizing as well and adding subtitles to music record"
"A suggestion to developers for future updates, please add an option to disable brightness and volume gestures on settings. There are buttons for it already on the slide menu for quick access, so disabling the gestures won't be a problem, also it gets in the way when holding the device. I know there is a ""lock"" feature to block gestures but it also disables the player buttons and menu. I hope the devs would consider this. Thanks! 😊"
"Excellent app. My laptop copies dvd's in chapters (.vob files) which I then send to my Samsung tablet. This app puts all the chapters together in the right order so I don't have to use a video editing app to stitch them together. Plays seamlessly although playback can be a little grainy, but this could be because I'm using tv recordings from dvd at standard def. Plays absolutely any file thrown at it. Downside full page ads can get intrusive but for a free app this is brilliant."
"This has been my favorite video & music player for quite some time now and my experience this far has been great, but recently I started having this issue of if I download a song, It won't show in the app, I could download like 5 songs straight up and only about three would show on the app and this is not so good, I don't want to find a reason to search for a replacement of this app cuz this one has been the best thus far... & A you should add the A-B repeat feature for music too..."
"This player is pretty awesome. You have brightness and volume control at your fingertips, even a screenshot option right on the screen. (no pressing power/volume down same time). Only thing l have a problem with is that sometimes when you open it, it just freezes and have to restart your phone."
"At first,enjoyed but later on not,because of the bad effects. I suggest,can you please reduce the effects(is it a transition effect?) for example when playing next video. You pressed the next arrow then you'll see the video played fast then normal.Not good in the eyes. looking forward for your solution. thank you."
"I played a YouTube 4K video, and the playback was sort of laggy, but still, it was better than the default video player that is available in Samsung phones. It was even better than VLC and other players. Minor improvements needed Material you theaming would be great. App icon should be changed (The app would look more default than a 3rd party app)"
"I love this app it is great but the audio eq needs a lot more work, When it is enabled it kills the output volume a lot, And my volume is at max just ends up sounding muffled until i turn it off. On the video side, This app is the best out there, Actually better than vlc on mobile and that is a certainty. The zoom capabilities of this app in video are awesome. It just does what vlc doesn't, But vlc audio is top notch. If you nail that, This app would be a killer all round."
pausing takes about a second to execute at first try
"Devs, the application is great and easy to use, I would have given it 5 stars but there's a option missing, the ""preferred language"" option for audio, whereas many other app have the option in there players, so this is my huge request to add this please, and the second request is to make this app operatable on Android tv, if these two requests got fulfilled then your application is gonna be greatest of all time !"
"I rated this 4 stars rather than 5 because if I have to turn off a video rather than simply pause it for a while, I cannot find an option that allows the video to continue playing from where I left off. The video starts all over again from the beginning and I have to manually scroll to the point where I had left off. Other than that it is an excellent app and works perfectly."
Nice app..I love it but it does not support webm file....and when we forward or backward the video there is a wierd screen for a few second..
"A very effective and good app, honestly better than some other players. However, there's an issue with subtitles, i downloaded subtitles for movies yet it doesn't display and the automatic download of a subtitle from the app doesn't work. Please do try to fix this.. wouldn't want this to stop me from using the app"
"Edit: I reduced to 4 stars due it is not resuming when streaming on TV. Amazing player. Much more stable than vlc. It was funny to see some reviews here that match my vlc problems and the pursuit for something less buggy. It is faster and with better UI too, making perfect. I even try others but this one did a better job in polishing UI and by having simple features such as video resuming. The only bad is the bunch of ads comparing with vlc, but I guess someone need to pay the bills =P"
"Hello Xplayer creators! I really love your app! After searching for almost months to find a perfect video player, I found yours, which is great! But... There is just one tiny bit of a problem.. So I resetted my phone while the Videos on my SD Card are in the hidden folder. The thing is..after I installed the app again, I couldn't recover the videos..and it's over 50+! How can I recover them??"
"I like this app, it has minimal and useful customization options which supports variety of formats. I would go for the premium only if it wasn't for the improper Audio/ Video Sync. Please fix this issue as its really frustrating sometimes while watching."
"Not bad. Wish i could change the private folder location to the SD card. That would make this app 5 stars for me. Otberwise the i terface is simple, playback is good, options are few and easy to navigate. It may replace MX player for me."
Simple and easy to use and download faster then other downloading apps I've tried and with less errors and even reconnect and resume download that failed priviously. I didn't think the advertisement between every function seem as annoying as the advertisement wasn't different and mostly same between 4 total I recall because I watched them repeat.but they were short and could be closed after a few seconds of view so it wasn't too bad considering I overall like the app.not bad and user friendly
Sound is awfully poor. I can't even enjoy the 200%. Is that the 15+15? I am not sure though. But I have already look at the settings of it.
"Very good player! The players that I got with my phone are pretty bad. This one is great, but it whould be nice for it to remember when you open recently added or to be able to set it as default. Edit: One issue, when casting to tv, there is no sound, please fix it."
"2 features would improve this app... 1. The facility to re-order songs in a Playlist & 2. the facility to point the app to a particular folder. Currently downloads from my browser do not automatically update to the track list. Otherwise, a simple interface and excellent sound quality."
"The video player is excellent for the Android Phone.  But the support was claimed for Android TV as well. But when i install this app on Android TV, the movie gets played flawlessly.  But i am unable to use the TV remote controls like Fast Forward, Rewind, Play, Pause controls.  Why it is like that ?  Is there any option to correct this problem?  Please advise."
This app is very exciting tp to use i love it very much but the only problem is the subtitles if you search for the subtitle of a particular film sometimes it shows another subtitle of another film pls this error should be fixed so that this app will be perfect and flawless
"Hello, I have X player version 2.1.0.1. App is nice but it's private folder does not work properly. Videos in private folder do lock in everywhere except  my gallery ver:v_1.3. Those videos name would change with some alphabetical letters and video also plays in gallery. New version has just  the same issue. Please make new version, solve this problem and remove all the new features that are added in new version specially double tap to skip. I have Android version 7.0, Device Name: Tecno K8."
Love it. Only thing missing for me is auto volume leveling. Please implement that.
Nice video player. Few suggestions here. Would be nice if you could just select a root folder for all media instead of the individual folders containing media. Also would be nice if media folders could be viewed in a tile/icon format instead of just as a list (like video files can viewed as a list or tiles). FInally would be nice to disable recently added folder as well as last played video. Over all a very good player with nice features. I like it better than VLC and MXPlayer.
"I like this player. But please could you add an option so that inside the player i can move audio and video files from one folder to another, and at the same time they are moved in the device"
It's great app for downloading and watch movies.
"I love this application, it's the best place to view all your favourite sports scores in one place, and keep track of the teams/players you follow. I give 4 stars because I would like to suggest some features that would truly make it perfect for me. - a one time fee to remove ads - if the above is not really possible, at least have the option to turn off betting ads and odds for those that struggle with gambling addiction - I could write more but I only have 500 chars"
"Had afew problems early on but got them sorted, . I Would like to see more motorsport covered, thr results given are a bit skimpy ar best and not covered at all in some cases like Brirish Superbikes and some of the classe in World Superbike. I wold like to be rid of those b Damned google abverts as well."
"Great app, adding some more statistics for football would give 5 star, also improving the formula one section Adding heat maps for football would be awesome Can you add the wins losses draws in the standings table, it's the only thing missing in that table"
Love Your previews and detailed stats. If only you can improve which will take your app to the top most rated and every Sports lover would absolutely dig the feature of showing odds history movement in live matches plus they remain on the app ui for ever.
Obviously I'm lying. It's 5 or more Stars. ⭐ I love the fact there's Ugandan grass root football live. But they need to work on swipe gestures on the Home Screen. That's wasted UI ability if not used. Also the probable and predicted line ups too based on injuries and form would be perfect.
"Great app but would've been even better if there was option to look at the game on the pitch, but overall it's much better than other apps. And it would be good to add comparison on the teams h2h o/u 2.5 goals and both teams score options as well and predictions options too."
"The app works great. I mostly stick to football(soccer). The one thing that you must change to keep up with your competitors is the ability to customize notifications for the teams I've marked as favorite. For example, I want notifications for every goal scored for some of my favorite teams, but I just want the final score notification for my other favorite teams. You deserve 5 stars when you have this feature available. For now, I'll give 4 stars."
"Good app, quick updates, wide scope of information. I like that it tells you where games are being shown on TV. The info about teams and players is brilliant. The only criticism I would have is the layout of cup competitions is quite poor."
"The app is very well built and coverage is really really good. I'd give it 5 stars if it was possible to have the notifications for favourite competitions and if you could choose different notifications based on what team you are following instead of having to use the same setting for every one of them. So, for now it is just 4 stars."
"Nearly a perfect app. Very quick & provides lots of options on alert types to a variety of sports. Could be better if they provide better stats in game for football (xpg, individual stats etc), needs to fix their motor racing so F1, WRC, MotoGP etc are treated like leagues & we don't need to favourite each race on its own. Boxing & MMA could do with some in game info like time of round/fight stats. Another feature needed is a game concluding alert in 85th minute, 2 min warning, 5 laps to go etc"
Cool and easy to use. Only need to work on the update of the team news. Some of the news are not instantly updated especially the transfer rumours.
"The app offers a simple livescores interface though a bit slow at times. It also provides score of all games; soccer, basketball, tennis name them."
Loving the interface and options provided.. more detailing wrt match performances and individual scores will help me to put the 5th star..overall super happy..
This app is cool but I would want you guys to increase the animation on it. Its more better if there's animation in clicks and swipes. Exciting app
"In football Goal kick stats should be added , at leqat for the major leagues, it wil be a big improvement. My favourite app though cos of its flexibility and organization."
"Everything you need in a live score app, I only have a problem with how they display the lineups, if they could just upgrade that look then everything would be great."
Can you expand the 'My Team' Category? It shows one can only add 20 teams as favourites. I'd love to recieve important notifications about my favourite teams(which include more than 20 teams). I hope you'll fix it soon. Otherwise you really deserve 5 star rating.🥰
"Very nice app, well operated... It gives me more details about the club, and some recent matches. The app is cool 😎"
"Quite a good app with lots of detail. Also, very prompt support and resolution from the developers ."
"Great app, good coverage and quick scores. Would rather the league standings have +-GD though."
"I really like this app and its fast update on games but the only problem I have is when there is no goal but you upload a notification about a goal and then write correction I use this app to follow my live games but your wrong information sometimes makes me want to uninstall the app. And one more thing I would love it if you guys can show favorites as a notification both live and upcoming game, because opening the app consistently to check live games is kind of frustrating. The last⭐ for that."
"Solid sports app. One thing I would like to be added to the app is a delay setting for the notifications. Now when I watch games on the TV I always have to mute the games notifications or else I get ""spoilers"", at worst the notification comes 15 seconds before the goal on tv."
"EDIT : Second update helped finally. Took a while though so 4 stars only. After many years of using app with no issues, now need to give a 1 rate. Same issue as per Richard's comment. App does not open, unless go through play store or have a 'favourite team' goal which can be pulled down from the top of screen. I did what developer advised which is uninstall and re installed. Phone also just received an update before so should not be an excuse."
"It has details about teams, players and matches which makes it perfect but it takes much time to lunch which makes it annoying."
"Very good, but short on a couple of items, would like to see the ratings for players and the kilometres covered."
"I'd give it a full 5 stars but for not being able to find some of the lower football leagues I'd like,apart from that this is the best one I've found,quick with the goals as they go in."
"Grate app. I just don't give 5 start because, in my opinion you should add an option/filter to see the games by starting time. Thanks for your time on the project"
"Remove ads super brains. We don't care about fundings. Users don't need ads. Therefore, you should remove ads if you want your app to be user friendly. 🙂"
"Good app. Would have got 5 stars if there wasn't a time lag for the live commentary (around 1.5 mins) but for score updates, absolutely brilliant."
it's cool one of the best but I would suggest if a means can be made for life stream and also match tracker so those who don't have means can be watching from the app but it's still the best fit me
Awesome app... But you can do better by at least adding a ball tracker option and a notification for corners. Then you'll get all five stars
"Great app. But can do better. Would have given a 5star rating but, there're some few complains/suggestions I believe can be fixed. Firstly, the notifications/popups on my starred matches should be able to display who the name of the player that scored and assist (when I'm not using the app). Secondly, is the missing vibration option for me, that should be added please. I think this are the two notable wants for me that I've noticed. Nice one guys."
The app is wonderful but you should update it to show seconds in basketball matches and indicate if theirs time out or free throw. Except from those problem it's the best livescore app
I just sent an email. Pls add opening odd (Starting odd giving to both teams in the match) and prematch Odd( the odd giving to the teams before match starts). I can only see the prematch odd.
"Best live results service for football, however changing the sport topic, automatically changes the date of which you are currently on, which is a little irritating, but only a small negative."
I prefer and recommend this app with its amazing features But I need you to put the match tracker like a simulation match tracker to make it more fun like the livescore app Kudos👏
"I like this app I use it always can you please can you add more options like to hide some of league's I can choose which league I want to see on the app. Please you can add options for tones like goalscorer, etc thanks."
"I'm much interested in this app. More often, when we're watching football match on tv, the ability to display big chance make those of us that use the app become 99% aware of the impending goal much earlier than our colleagues that don't use the app. You should work on each match day seperate standings so that if I desire to check match day 4 standings for reference sake after matchday day 20, I would be shown only the outcome after matchday 4 seperately including top scorers and top assist"
This is the best live score app due to the extensive information regarding players and teams. A few visual adjustments needed to be '5 stars' e.g. game summary details needs to be clearly separated for each team's event. Currently it's kind of confusing to someone not used to the format as I was when first using the app.
"The tennis homepage should show the strongest tournament currently being played, as it's already the case with the website version."
"Great app, very fast. It doesn't have non-league cup games though. Football Web Pages is better in this regard."
Good app.... When compared with LiveScore and Sofa this app have some delay and sometime notification doesn't work properly but all in all good and useful app.
Great for live football scores. Also good for snooker scores but doesn't show points score in frame or would gave given 5 stars.
Great app and even has rugby league scores on it. Would be better if it included the womens teams too though.
A very great and good reliable app which gives fast and accurate Football Goals and also score lines.
score/goal updates are slow compared to other apps would also need good to have data on managers (previous management) like you do for players
"Great and fantastic app but my little problem is at time's when you're listen to a commentry and the match ended, the commentry keeps on run for few minutes before it stopped."
Very much better than the former easy to navigate quickly and make findings as soon as possible
"I like the app very much but after match is being played, I don't know how to find the already played teams."
"I enjoy flash score the only problem I find is golf matchplay where it should say 1up, 2up etc it has 5.5 or something like that is not how matchplay scores go. Darren s"
Great app.. still the best so far. You should expand more in basketball games and adding more stats details in football (like goal kicks and live match trackers and momentums)
"This is a very great live score app. But one thing I have a problem with is, you sometimes take too long in updating us with activities of some games such as postponement, lineups etc. Your competitors are faster in terms of that than you guys. Please work on that."
Really useful app. Is prone to crashing on android. Works perfectly on iOS.
"The app is very nice.... It's provide u with good odds , fast results and clear analysis of the games .."
Very good and accurate and fast is goal... Please try and make some matches available for videos...
"Really good app very useful for me as i follow a lot of leagues. Would be nice if you could include more English non league fixtures, also increase the amount of favourites you can have."
"Great app , just needs a premium version like other apps, to get rid of the annoying adds"
Great app for sports scores plus you can follow all your favourite teams/sports.
Good but need to improve on live watching games like Aiscore....we want to also watch live matches
"flashscore it's one app very good,but I suggest of delete audio commentary, it's very annoying, thanks 👍"
"I only downloaded it yesterday but I'm already enjoying the best it offers. But a few things are missing: It doesn't show how many ""INJURY TIME"" was given. It'd also be nice if it shows a ""COUNTDOWN"" before the next Halve starts. Thanks and Keep up the good work 👍👏"
It's an awesome application however I don't receive notifications anymore during my favorite matches
It easy to use and push notifications in time
It is a good app it has helped me to see the matches with there head to head history with each team
"The best sport app available on the planet. Indeed kudos to the developers, they are doing a great Job."
"Wonderful app but why is it that it doesn't show full table information? It shows only Games Played,Goals for,Goals against and Points."
"Used the app and not bad, try to set the notification sound"
"The best app around but I'd just like to have my selected leagues and not the rest of the world. If so, it would be 5 stars"
"Exceptional and dependable app with excellent sports coverage. However, kindly increase the number of selectable “My Teams”. It's annoying reaching maximum so soon."
"I love this app and find it useful in my day-to-day sports trading activities. However, there is a sync issue between the app and the desktop version. Whenever I select games in the app, it takes long to sync with the desktop version. It only syncs seamlessly when I do the selections from the web version. You need to fix the bug that is causing this delay, as it is kind of annoying. Thank you."
"Same as a lot of other comments, I'd like to see more detail in the league table, ie games won, drawn and lost. I understand it might not be available due to space restrictions on mobile phones when in portrait mode, but it could be visible when rotating to landscape, as there is currently a large blank space left between team names and the played/points. Other than that, good app."
Just about perfect - been using for 7+years. I want the ability to pay for ad free version of the app as I hate adverts be it on pc or phone. Wouldn't mind paying a couple of quid for the ad-free version. On a non-rooted phone so can't install an adblocker I don't think. Apart from that it's a solid app. Great selection of sports and updates are timely.
"It's really hard to follow an NFL match in the app. The gametime, which should be counted down, is counted up. Some essential info such as timeouts left, field position for every play or live commentary is missing. And having the lineups is not of much use if you don't have players stats for the game. I really hope you can step the coverage up for next season. 🏈🏈"
"Your app is one of the best out there! Because of the recent update. Just like what I've read and encountered myself while using the app. The notification sounds that comes when a goal is scored! And disallowed are the same! It has to be changed. Aside that, the app is perfect and the interface looks smooth!😎"
"Easy to check score updates, can even put favorites that will pop up on the screen when they score"
Great app. Has every sport and game I need. Super quick on updates and information. Only 4 star as I would like an ad free version. Although these ads aren't intrusive.
A really good app but needs additional features like.... 1. A collapse all button at the live score page. 2. A penalty awarded indication also at the live score page. After that 5 stars assured
Easy to find my favourite league and very fast to notify me. Nice
"It's a great app but the one thing that's missing for me is football players' assists from their career stats. I don't care about how many yellow cards they've had over the season I'd rather see amount of assists. I'd love it if for each game there was also an A in a circle showing they got an assist that game for example. Also, football tables need to have W/D/L on not just goals for and against."
Flashscore South Africa has updated me with scores. I absolutely love and appreciate the app!
"Very nice app, the only problem is in the lineups of some teams. Indeed, the team disposition is not always correct. But all the rest is perfect !"
"Great interface, seamless navigation and timely score updates, reasonable file size as well. I love it so much, keep up the good work. Edit: the new update will definitely take some getting used to. I feel the fonts are smaller though and not as great as the old one. Taking out one star from the 5 I gave in 2020."
Very good app but my only problem is when the matches are on favourite it doesn't notify you if there is a goal or something like the old one. I think you should work on that. That is the reason for my my 4 stars
Always updated with the best information.
"Best app for scores I have found and used. My only issue is that the score don't display correctly on Huawei smart watch, another scores app does, so not sure why."
"Very nice Football stats app. Although, you it asks to reload everytime with any slight network issue. I still like the app and it's features"
It's absolutely the best App for sporting scores. It even goes ahead of television views. Great work on it indeed.
Since i started using this app I've never refretyiy for once The name Flash Score 🤩🤩 is the best name that should b given to the app cos it's very fast in terms of uploading scores and line ups and some pre match and post match analysis Kudos 2 dis app ♥️♥️♥️
"I love the app: it consume less data and very accurate statistics, but they don't provide statistic for some league like Bulgaria , Albania etc, please add possession lost to your stat."
Good apps i'm really like it but you should look how to watch matches online..I'm very please with the expected goal % that you added but u need to give the statistic about all the matches..anyway just continue
"I like the app, is very easy to operate, and also give all the reqires details for each matches, I love the app."
"I love the fact that I can access all the matches, stats and all. Also, the app loads effortlessly. We'll done."
"Disappointing since last software update. When you click on a match both teams are highlighted in their division ""standing"". One team takes time to locate in the division because the highlighting is not sufficient (it used to be in the old system). Your customers are not all 20 year olds with perfect eyesight."
Great app. No ads popping up on the pages. Fast and easy to use
Great app handy for scores and standings but would be nice if they could update scores and tell the scorer quicker
I'd give 5 stars if you provide option to filter by odds. It would help a lot.
It is good app in showing all matches but odds are related to those in betting app s
"like it when it comes to analysis, very simple and easy to use"
"It's just easier to view and it makes me understand scores, it has date different"
This app is the most efficient and easy app to use for football research for anyone.
"Only four stars this time, but it is very good for email, especially, if it's for business. Although, could you have more options available for attaching documents, like video clips with a longer duration period of time, to a single email ( like a power point presentation )? Because, I think having an option like that would be really awesome! But, thank you so much for making such a great operating email app! Bravo 👏! I'd say you've got Google running for their money, with this one. 😉"
Been using it for years. It's well thought out. I was just upset 😡 when it was changed recently so that I could not combine it with another email app that I used to move all my emails to one area. I used to have outlook together with my other emails 📧 but now it doesn't work in that app a d I'm not sure if I can pull my other email apps into outlook so they can all be in one place.
"I wish they would add features, like the ability to view, add, or modify, photos in signatures. The app likes to freeze up a bit, causing a forced stop of the app. When you press ""mark as read"" on the notifications sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. It's very picky about when it wants to work and when it does not. Overall good app, but it has some issues that a simple test would have revealed before main branch rollout. I wish they would take the time to test it...."
"Experience has been generally good, is very convenient to have mail, calendar, contacts and files all accessible from the same app and although it's not full feature parity with the desktop app, it handles all of the critical items. Some may find it a little less effective than the native mail app for their device but I think having everything together is worth the trade-off."
"Outlook is badass. Outlook is waaaay better than Gmail. I love the different features Outlook has. I love the different ways to report junk. It would be nice if u could select multiple senders to block multiple senders instead of just one at a time. I like that there's a sound for sending emaiIs like texting. That's cool. I'm confused to why u can't edit the categorize that are already there to were u can use the categories for emails, events,and contact's like it says that u can in the app."
"A good program overall although it does some strange quirks and glitches here and there. Part of that is the learning curve on my part. The program does offer quite a bit of customization and is probably better for people that find that important. Gmail worked fine for me, but our company changed and so Outlook it has been for the past year."
Excellent mobile productivity app. Works seamlessly with Microsoft MFA and MS Teams as well as biometric login. I don't really like the focused inbox filter and I wish there was a way to create new meetings in the calendar function rather than appointments but overall it's a good app. I haven't encountered any bugs or connectivity issues.
"App works as expected, and has for many years that Ive been using it. Some of the settings/features can be difficult to find between the app, desktop application, and MS 365 online site. Takes a little time to find what I'm looking for, but usually a Google search will solve the issue. Still, you could do far worse than Outlook, and I don't know if there are any other apps with the same features and integrations."
"Outlook is a pretty good email platform. I've had my account for about 14 years now--since back when it was ""Hotmail."" First, it's free, but it's not overwhelming me with ads! Second, Outlook provides ample storage and organization capabilities for my needs. Four stars instead of 5 because, there aren't a lot of good customization options, and the platform isn't great at recognizing junk from non-junk, and vice versa."
"Having to hunt to find the ""do not disturb"" setting now is a bit irritating. It was much quicker and simpler before the update. The update also includes a constant ad in bold print at the top of your messages which can, at first glance, look like an unread email, which I assume is intentional. I had no complaints in all the years I've used this app, but now it feels kind of skeevy and cheap."
"I started with Hotmail decades ago and it morphed into Outlook and I still have it. Although I have several other email accounts as backups, I am not as Adept on them and so use them only when I need to. Plus I cannot really compare Outlook to anything else, but it has worked for me for a long time and I would recommend it to others. Regarding Outlook and Edge, Etc, I just wish the techs would quit messing with stuff so much. Change just for the sake of change is not very entertaining to me."
"Great interface, wonderful that it's accessible on different platforms including Android phones; Another positive aspect, rather seamless integration with OneDrive. But. one problem: the latest desktop version of Outlook has regressed especially in its search capability, almost impossible to perform a detailed search for an email unlike the previous version."
"Overall this app works well, and no where as many adds as Yahoo mail. My biggest pet peeve, when opening the app the onscreen envelope flashes a few times before it opens. I suppose this is to let me know the app is opening, but the opening envelop flashing several times is annoying. I have a Gmail account, when I click mail it goes straight to it."
"Good app. Only issue is the ability to create rules and folders on the app. I rarely ever use my computer and when I do, I'm not thinking about logging in to Outlook to create a rule. It would make a lot of sense if the app included this feature. Otherwise, I'm happy with it. Update; Rules don't seem to be working. I've set a few and they don't work when I run them on messages already in my inbox let alone when I get a new message that follows the rule."
I have had the same msn email address for 18yrs and have gone through many different changes with it. The Outlook app has worked pretty well for me through the years and I'm able to customize how I want but just recently I have started getting spam mail in my inbox multiple times daily and I can't figure out how to fix it. It's 3yrs later and I came looking forward to an update because I'm having this issue again pretty bad today. Spam filter is basically not working at all. Please fix this.
"Works good with all my imap accounts. Issues with notifications, the app will notify me of emails that I have read and replied to for days. It just keeps telling me I have new email and when I expand the notification its the same emails I have already read. I then open the app, no new emails. Other then the notification stuff app works great. No ads, simple and clean interface. Exactly what I want. Used on galaxy note 9."
I have used outlook/microsoft all the way back to when Hotmail was popular lol. I love it and I didn't even want to switch to Gmail initially. However this past year the amount of spam that is coming to my focused inbox is crazy. I keep reporting and blocking and it doesn't seem to matter. I would rate 5 if this issue could please get resolved soon. I have reached out also and no one ever followed up with me.
"Fairly good experience with Outlook, however when I check my emails on my phone it doesn't register that I've already checked them when I open Outlook on my computer. Also, there are times when my Outlook at work will provide some emails from the weekend, then I check my emails again the next day and it brings up more emails from the weekend. (It's not because my mailbox is full.) This has been happening too often."
"I still prefer Outlook over all. I like the features added to draw in the email. What I Do NOT LIKE is that I have lost my ability with pdfs. And am forced to open, save etc in edge via my outlook. I can quick print, but not chose to print on both sides or go to black and white rather than color. I have full Adobe so I can work in Bridge or in Adobe to edit items. If can change this PLEASE TELL ME HOW. THIS IS A DAILY FRUSTRATION. Updates also do not hold on to MY defaults and preferences."
"As a M365 subscriber, Outlook provides everything you want for an email provider and more. You can use the app for just about any email account (yes, even Gmail) with many of the benefits. The one that always brings this app down is email signatures. You cannot embedded images or do half the text customization you can on a desktop or web interface. Very frustrating."
"Update: The forced ""Bing Search"" option was removed, no longer appears anywhere so problem is resolved for now Original: Microsoft forcibly snuck a ""Bing Search"" option on the context menu whenever you select text anywhere on your whole phone. Very shady move that no one wanted and it can't even be disabled. I installed outlook for just email, not for a knock-off search engine"
"Communicating via email on my phone is the last thing I want to do. However, there care many emails I receive that only need to be read, and for those Outlook on my phone is great. I can read them while commuting to work on the train. And, since Outlook is synced across all my devices, anything I read on the phone is marked as read when I open Outlook on my computer."
"Incredible! I have actually been utilizing it for a couple of months currently as well as it's been a lifesaver. I was utilizing a different email app in the past, but I switched to Expectation due to the fact that it's so much far better. The interface is really easy to utilize and it's extremely quickly. I like the fact that it integrates with my various other e-mail accounts, also. I would absolutely recommend this app to anyone!"
I like the user interface as it is snappy and intuitive. I wish there were more account modification capabilities in the desktop app for PC though so if I wanted to change my password or update my email address I could do it directly from the app instead of having to navigate to the browser version.
"I'm not the biggest fan of running everything to through the phone but Outlook was easy to install and setup and use for my most frequently used emails that I must admit that I like it a lot. The IMAP setups were a breeze. The only caveat is limited sort criteria. That, I believe, should be worked on."
"Great email interface. Ability to organize everything, from incoming, outgoing, VIP, newsletters, subscriptions, Friends, etc. Only problem when I try to make certain incoming emails to go into certain folder based on subject field, and by sender, some will follow the guidelines but then some others continually don't."
It works but it's a bit buggy. I have to re-enter my credentials randomly. My organisation makes us update our passwords every 3 months but for some reason the app will lose the cached information about every other week. Scrolling through long email chains is also buggy. I just forward the emails to my Google account to read it easily. Edit: Looks like they've corrected the issue where I had to re-enter my credentials.
"App is great. I dropped from 5 to 4 stars because the widget has a very annoying quirk. The calendar widget continually unchecks my main work calendar in settings. I will go to settings check the main calendar and all events from that calendar and others show up. But a few hours later I look at the calendar and it's got no events from my main work calendar again. All of the outlook auxiliary calendar events (holidays, sports teams, Google cal) are still there"
"This app has always been easy to navigate and use. Ads are not intrusive or excessive, as can be the case with other email apps. However, in recent months, far too many spam/scam emails are getting through to the main inbox, when they always used to get filtered directly to the spam box. If not for this issue, I would be giving Outlook five star rating."
"M365 version for android is better...but still misses some things 1. A huge miss, though, is that the app lacks any ability to collapse the folder/directory trees. Huge pain... 2. Would be nice to be able to set default font formatting to use when composing emails. 3. Same suggestion above applies to signatures...currently, the app only seems to support lists, bold, italics, underline, and 3 styles (Body, Subheader, Title...none of which can be customized or configured as far as i can tell...)."
I use outlook for the majority of my email accounts but I'm reconsidering because it won't allow customization of the web browser used to open links. I want to use Chrome for web links and outlook recently started forcing Microsoft Edge. They have a setting where you can change this but it simply doesn't work and still opens edge. I prefer to have a choice.
"Mostly good. It will crash on my device maybe once or twice a month, but that's a minor annoyance. It also seems to have trouble writing/editing relatively long messages; after it goes beyond a couple of edit-window lengths, it will start behaving strangely (hiding the row with the cursor below the bottom edge of the edit box, for example.) Mostly good though, which is why it's still my choice."
"Outlook is the easiest email system I have used. I enjoy being able to search with key words. I, however, don't love the connection to my contacts in my phone. I don't believe I've approved it but I probably need to just spend time to turn it off somewhere. I will always use Outlook for everything I can over any of its competitors."
"Generally, the app works well. I have used Outlook for many years on both my work and business computers. I have difficulty getting the Android app to work the same as the Windows app. For example, I can't figure out how to include the incoming email when I reply to it, as the Windows app does."
"Update: the app has been patched and the problems mentioned below are gone! Thx Hello team, would like to ask for assistance together with this poor rating (sorry guys). Since last update, I'm not able to open my Outlook inbox anymore. Tried reinstalling updates to the default app on Android and still no change. I do receive push notifications when an email comes and I can write an email by using the quick command from the home screen of the phone, but inbox simply can't be opened. Please help"
"What idiot put the send button so close to the end of the text area!? If I move the cursor then need to return it back to the end of my sentence, I can accidentally send unfinished emails with no way of recalling. Put the send button out of accidental reach!! Other than that, the app is excellent."
"It used to be advert free, not anymore. Helps with reporting spam and phishing emails at times. Not always... The outlay to find such thing as block list and to delete contacts that are not needed. It should have an option if keeping the important emails that have been sent for correspondence of sorts. Above all, not a bad app. Still needs some work to it. More options and ways to make it safe from potential hackers."
Pretty good experience. I use it for most of my email accounts including Google accounts. I love the dark mode. I feel like the desktop version could be more user friendly as it's sometimes hard to find the setting or option I want but otherwise a pretty solid app with no ads or issues.
"I love the folders for storing and organizing saved emails , however, it appears to be impossible to delete obsolete folders... I went through and deleted several as per instructions only to find he emptied 'deleted' folder titles are placed at the top of the list with no way to get rid of them. From what I've read, for some unfathomable reason, outlook is not capable of fixing this problem. Why on earth would I not have the option to delete what's no longer needed ???"
"Overall i'm pretty satisfied but i can't find any way to turn off email preview in notifications even though my app is locked. I don't need to open the app to read the email which is major down against privacy. I got it paid with office 365 subscription. Also when i minimise it and slide up which shows preview of all open apps, it previews whatever email was open on app. Its a big down"
Pretty decent. The application on my Samsung phone and Samsung tablet lets me see all of my email addresses at once but it doesn't do that on my laptop. It makes me log out of each one in order to log into another one. It's a real pain. I'd rather go all the way back to Outlook Express.
"When I reply to an email thread, the most recent message from the thread (the one I'm replying to) is not visible. I have to keep scrolling up to see it and then scrolling back down to continue composing my reply. It's very illogical. I would expect to be typing my reply at the top of the thread with the most recent message directly below the typing pane. Indeed, this is how Outlook works on a web browser. I don't know why Outlook for Android has to be so clumsy to use."
"Hello, very good application but a bug comes up frequently: once filled, the description of an event can't be modified anymore (the modification is lost after the update). You have to delete the event and recreate it with the updated description. Thank you for your help."
"Overall good app, very useful. However, recently the calendar has started repetitively reminding me of the same items. Seems to be recurring appointments that have a reminder set more than a day out, i use the app on an iPad as well as my android & PC but it only does it on the android."
"Love the app. However, I have many rules set up where emails are automatically placed into various folders. Normally, I would use the unread email folder. Like on the PC. However on this app it only shows unread email within the folder. Not all folders therefore I have to open each individual folder to read my emails. Is their another function to use so all unread emails can be found."
"Some folders (deleted and drafts) do. T sync nut that might be a problem with the host/server on my organisation's side. Otherwise, I like the app's functionality. Emails come in almost instantly, calendar works fantastically (with reminders and all), drafting emails is easy and the UI is also relatively easy to work with."
"I do like this app very much, but it does have problems. Sometimes if I delete an email, it keeps popping back up as if it is new mail. I really, really hate that, but other wise I like it. It's easy to use and I can check all my accounts in the same app. And there are NO ads, which I LOVE!!!"
"I am satisfied with the app mostly. I use it to manage multiple accounts (imap, gmail, hotmail). I have only seen a problem which I don't know where to report (your email is a noreply one) Sometimes while writing a reply and potentially attaching a file, I save it as a draft and come back to it later and send it. The received message on the other end is huge. They gotta scroll horizontally and vertically to view it. It seems thr signature font size is increased by 10fold at least."
"Good app and love how easily it's able to get a multitude of other emails not necessarily outlook in nature. However, the app badge itself at times no longer shows the amount of emails currently there and then it also stops email notifications being put up immediately and must be done manually."
"I like Outlook because it does not scrutinise the content of my e-mails, and those sent to me, and uses their content, to its advantage. It supports also inline links and content rich signatures, and seamlessly works with Office 365. The only feature Outlook doesn't have which I would like is the setting up and managing of e-mail rules that determine what Outlook should do with certain e-mails."
"Pretty good, but Calendar entry rather basic, and cannot copy appointments between accounts or copy to another date. Cannot move or copy an email to a folder in another account. Cannot restrict contact info access to Android by account, so difficult to separate work info from private info. Calendar notifications are not brilliant, either on front screen or during use. The basic stuff does work pretty well."
"My issue with unsyncing contacts seems to have been fixed, which is great. I still have some complaints about the spam filter being quite ineffective as of recently, but other than that I quite like the design and functionality of the app"
"Reliable email account and provider, with the occasional spam filtering through, but definitely more secure than Yahoo and Gmail. What would be great is the ability to keep calendar and email both open at the same time, especially when having to copy info from an email into a calendar entry"
"Works Very Well. The mobile app syncs perfectly to my laptop. Also, I've never experienced any technical issues that impact the app's usage and performance. Outlook is the E-mail platform for business people. It's connection to my calendar is seamless and wonderful."
"Very good to me, I added all my emails in 1 app. I only don't like that in notifications you add reply at right side like default and don't give ability to change it. In the previous version, I have there delete button, and for now - all time when I want to delete - I push reply button... It's not cool... Give me the ability to change it on delete."
The reply/ compose text box is at the bottom of the screen. Not really a good spot for it. Also you can flag items but not mark as complete. The buttons at the bottom to switch between calendar/mail are small and not really visible. Can't make Outlook calendar or contacts its own home screen button. Can't adjust sync schedule
"Still the best pim tool around. However, finer control over search items would be appreciated. Syncing contacts across all devices and apps is not as prompt as could be, however this may be an Android issue."
"This app is excellent. The one big miss is having the same option as Gmail when reviewing emails. When I delete an email viewed in my inbox I would like to see the next or previous email in my inbox. Right now I am booted back to the full inbox to click on the next message. This request, made my many directly to Microsoft, has been ignored for years. With that option and the ability to chose a theme not driven by a political agenda would make this app irreplaceable."
"Very good overall. Just a suggestion, why don't you do a calendar widget like Google calendar? Big monthly widget instead of event coming soon list only. I still use Google calendar because of this function but actually I am using many of Microsoft products. It could be very useful. Also sync Microsoft To Do list into calendar like how Google sync Tasks into Google Calendar. Hope to see improvement soon."
"Microsoft Outlook is an exceptionally helpful and safe app that helps me stay linked and effective. I enjoy the benefit of being able to access all my email, data, as well as calendar in one location. It's easy to arrange my e-mail, with filters that aid me swiftly discover what I require. I also appreciate the spam e-mail defense that maintains my inbox without scrap and unwanted messages. Generally, I extremely recommend Microsoft Outlook for any individual looking for a safe, trusted e-mail a"
"This app has enabled me to check my emails and calendar events on my phone with ease for a long time. However, there is some frustration with inability to perform certain tasks; so, I then go to main email site on my computer. Oh, hate the forced Ad email they started not long ago."
"In Windows it's a 5*, but Android restricts it's ability to create multiple subfolders, in all Email formats, which Windows allows. Thankfully this can be overcome by connecting to Windows & creating the required additional subfolders. But it's still much superior than Gmail, however, Android is built on older technology - Linux, which is built on - Unix, one of the original OS's the Internet was built on. I love the To Do app, which allows the management of To Do lists, in Email & calendar"
"It lost one star from me just because the calendar function is so annoying. Outlook is my personal account, however, I also have an Office 365 work account. I just want the calendars to sync and nothing else 😪 I gave up on that and then tried to just sync both accounts with Samsung Phone Calendar, and again, it just didn't go well. So perhaps in future updates, pay attention to making a sync more user-friendly and seamless."
"The app doesn't have some features, such as the signature, that the desktop version has. I would like to and sometimes need to be able to send work emails from my phone that contains my work email signature. Fir themus reason, I can not use the app for work email and am forced to use another email app that does allow for signatures."
"The app is very easy to use and the interface is pretty. I'll rate it 4 stars as the ""focused"" inbox is more of a nuisance than a feature to filter out important emails, since it splits your inbox into 2 things and you won't know where it will appear, so I personally disabled it."
"On the whole a great app. Usefully combines my work and personal emails and calendars into one combined platform. One or two features I would like to see include moving to next email rather than returning to main email list (e.g. Google's Gmail app). Also, there's a big delay in getting the actual notification for any emails that arrive. Most of the time I've already seen, filed or deleted emails, before i get the notification."
"Got to use outlook due to the default school system. To be honest, I enjoy working on the webpage version better. Yet the app does provide friendly interface for users."
"Helps manage events/meetings quite well and is overall quite user-friendly. Only thing that I find a bit frustrating is a few things with the UI, such as not being able to scroll up to look at the email I'm replying to for reference and instead having to completely exit out of my draft to look at it again. Otherwise, I do recommend it. Good for work tasks."
"If you press ""back"" in the signature options after typing in the signature you want to have, it will neither save/update your signature, nor warn you that by pressing back your changes will be discarted. It should do one of these, preferably the second. And this Microsoft thing of not conforming to Monet guidelines makes every app look like a sore thumb. I'm going to stop using them soon if this isn't fixed."
"Why is it that on the phone version of Outlook Blocking and/or sending a sender to the Junk folder do not work? It works fine on the Office version, but not on this one. Could you please rectify this on future updates? Thanks."
"Latley outlook has not been loading and has been crashing. I'm deleting my outlook app until the issues are resolved. Before December 10th, it worked out well for the most part. Update Working a lot better since my last review."
Reliable. Wish it was easier to add people to safe mailing list. Mail lists are a little cumbersome too. They could do a better job filtering junk mail. But overall it's a good app.
"A decent app, integrates really well with Microsoft 365. I have been having an issue with the calendar sync (to the Android default calendar) stopping out of nowhere. It needs a fix."
Second account didn't add Issue I'm try to add another account which have gmail at the end and it blong to my Microsoft Outlook account but as soon as I'm fill my password it shows authenticating and then ask my password again and this thing happening in loop I can't even log in my second account in Outlook app. Please fix this issue as soon as possible
"Great compared to having to access my email via a web browser. Unfortunately I am not able to sort the messages by who they are from and other various options that would be useful. Also, the ""search"" email doesn't seem to work at all."
"it's great, would love to be able to swipe left or right on emails that you've gone into to go into the email before or after the one you are reading. Much like the functionality in Gmail"
"Only drawback that might be just my setup is to follow a link in the email, and it opens up in the actual email program rather than a separate browser. This means you can not get back to the email with the link without closing the window that you'd linked to . This is often a problem."
Hate the fact that most e-mail services are run with ads. :( Id prefer if there was an option to disable such. Nonetheless I still preffer outlook over gmail. The layout and organization is superb and I really enjoy the features it has. 4/5 Could do perfect without ads.
"The differences in how the app works on different platforms is confusing. On the iPad it is not so good, it is marginally better on a Samsung phone, it is really very good on a PC. Microsoft please improve the performance and usability in the other platform and make them behave more like the Windows PC version of the app."
"Loving the changes. However the sorting is not the same as the desktop app. I have the desktop app set to Pinned, Received date, would be nice to have pinned emails at the top on mobile version as well or at least be able to change the sorting."
"After a (short) break-in period of annoyance, I've come like the current Outlook experience better than the old version. Thanks!.......With all these features, is there a way to learn how to use all of them, such as a series of You Tube tutorials?"
"I have a work account and a personal account that can seamlessly swap, whether on PC or mobile. UI could use some more options to personalize mailbox visuals, but other than that it's a no-nonsense program that does exactly as it describes."
"Pretty good, although I sometimes have trouble sending emails. I occasionally get an error through the app only that says ""unable to deliver message"". But when I send it through the browser, it's perfectly fine."
Works well overall. It is missing some features of the desktop version that I use even though I have an active Microsoft 365 subscription. These include font size editing or at least a way to add and/or edit an existing style and support for multiple signatures with similar font editing capabilities as above for this as well.
"Great App. I now use this for all my other emails. I am currently having challenges with adding a Yahoo premium Mail to the Outlook App. It keeps saying that Authentication Error, please try again some other time. I have looked up the issue and have realised other people are reporting same but with no solution yet to. Please Help."
"Very good except that it still sends new mail notifications for emails already deleted on another device. Googling this issue reveals this has been happening for years and no action has been taken to fix it. So I have now added my Microsoft account to the Gmail app and just use that. Shame, as this app is otherwise a pleasure to use."
"While I hate Microsoft for numerous reasons, I do have to say that this is the singularly best Email+Calendar client for Android. I don't like how the Calendar widget doesn't have a separate light and dark theme, I really think there should be a light theme for the Calendar widget."
Mostly positive. I want more storage without having to upgrade. Our storage was full so it cut off the sending and receiving of emails for 3 days while we were trying to clean up. We missed important emails that we were never able to recover. Other than that we love Outlook
"Edit: for almost a year I was unable to use this with my personal account via IMAP. However they finally appear to have fixed the problem. With that functionality restored, the application works quite well"
"Outlook, is a good program. However, it could be better. For example, the calender is not as versatile as the Google calendar and has fewer functions, eg., reminders."
"It is a great tool to organise your mails, although I was failed by the schedule send feature twice, never tried it again. Created a schedule send mail, and for some reason it doesn't get sent, had to go to the outbox and hit send now."
"A really great multifunctional calendar and email app. Helpful, simple, and easy to use. Personally, I'd prefer a more customizable calendar layout, but the the app's reliability and lack of technical difficulties make it easy to forgive it's aesthetic shortcomings."
"I have used Outlook since 1995. It has done a lot to change with the times. Though it has occasional glitches, it still is the most comprehensive email program I've ever seen. It is effective for all my business email."
"App WAS great. All of a sudden I'm not getting push notifications from outlook and this is a big issue for me. I've tried restarting my phone, app is up to date and I allow push notifications... im at a loss now"
"Would like a link or indicator to reply sent in Inbox. Fairly easy to navigate. The calendar is great for reminders and anniversaries. UNDO on delete, move etc. useful. RESTORE deleted emails once used isn't scary as you can select what to restore."
"Very good. But sometimes I get frustrated with limitations on sending attached files, especially photos. However, that doesn't happen enough to stop using app. Pleased overall."
"I made the switch from the google verse to Microsoft paid services and I'm actually very impressed with Outlook. I feel more organized using Outlook. Google services are very fragmented. I just need my email to be email. I promise, MS would get more search users, if the changed Bings name! Clippy needs to happen! Asap!"
I had a issue today that almost cost me a $900 fine. I get (should get) email notifications from VicRoads informing me when my car registration is due. I have always opened emails from VicRoads yet..... For some reason unknown to me the last few emails have gone to junk mail. This meant I did not receive the email notifications that my car registration was due. Thus meaning I have been driving an unregistered car for 4 days. Today I was pulled over by the police for driving an unregistere
I enjoy working with Outlook because it has everything I need. It is also an easy application to use. I also find that's it's put together in an organized and clean viewing manner. They offer a lot and I will keep on using it.
Wonderfully easy to use. Having difficulty erasing a non-existent email account. Tired of the daily messages to remove it. Have been trying for years now.
"It plays many types of audio files and can organize a large library very well. I found an issue, though. When I start a song from a different album than what's playing, the audio cuts out for a couple seconds. A small bug that's a little annoying, but not enough of an issue for me to consider another app."
"Honestly, can't go wrong with an open source video/audio player that's been in the works for decades. One issue that I currently have is that after updating my Samsung phone, whenever I cast to my TV via smart view, it crashes when trying to play video files. I tap on the video, and it plays for like 0.25 of a second and then boots me back to the media library. Samsung's android notifies me that there's a bug in this app, but I don't know why. Hopefully it will get fixed."
"Works quite well, haven't noticed any bugs. The only things that get in the way are the way it lists your downloads, and the fact that theres no auto shuffle on the playlists. You can shuffle if you open the playlist but that I can get over, it the way the downloads don't have a way to sort by download date, and search for a song works. Sometimes It won't pull up a song even if you put in the name exactly, and its really touch and go if you want to search by artist."
"No ads! Missing ZOOM, No sort by date, length, size. Also does NOT let you rename files or edit tags. It also can't CAST to other devices. Good: works 100% without any bugs and No ads, no bloat, the perfect minimalist player. The mp3 part is missing key functionality Making this only a movie player. I use a separate app for music because there is many mp3 features lacking. The biggest issue is NO WAY to edit file meta data. You can't change a song's genre type or it's tags. No file tag editing"
"I've been using VLC ever since Google killed off Play Music. There was a bug for the past few months that would prevent the music from resuming playback automatically, but that seems to have been resolved by the recent update. It seems VLS has returned to its former glory, and I'm thrilled about it."
"Since the death of Play Music this has been my go-to for media on my phone. It works pretty well, I also use it to listen to soma.fm and has Android auto capability. My only complaint is with the Android Auto interface itself. I have a lot of albums on my phone and the ones I listen to more frequently are towards the bottom of the list, every time I go back to the albums it takes me all the way to the top and I have to scroll down again."
"Normally I would give this app five stars I have been using it for a very long time. The recent version is very buggy, audiophiles will not resume playback at the right place until you hit the 10 second rewind button. The three-dot menu to the right of each file is now missing, making it impossible to delete files from VLC itself"
"I'm a long time VLC user. It's my default desktop & mobile media player. App wise, I only have one real complaint. On the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, there's no persistent notification badge up top. I do see it within the swipe-down notifications. I'd like the option to have the persistent badge, to realize it's still open, if I need to close it. Also, sometimes this app shows up as ""paused"" in the swipe-down after a reboot. But overall as an app media player, I love it."
"If you're watching a video, switch to anything else so that it plays in the background, close the app and then find back to try to watch the same video, the audio will resume as if there is no video, and you can't get it to play the actual video. EDIT: The long press on the cover brings up a green screen, Pixel 3a playing a webm"
"ALMOST like the full computer app. 1 major difference is the absolute requirement to go into the app to find the media you want played. Otherwise it's basically a finger wag. I don't think it saved or held a library, but would be nicer to just hold a button on the media itself to pick vlc rather that go through the app."
"This is the most versatile and well known media player in existence. Cross platform. No BS. My only complaint is that rescanning my media is hit and miss. Sometimes it works, sometimes it takes 2 or 3 long scans, and sometimes it's so stubborn that I have to delete all app data and settings, reconfigure, and only then does it find my new files. Autoscan never works. No matter what scanning is always slow."
"Great audio/ video player. Computer program is better though. I guess with one of the recent updates you can't view the player from the locked screen anymore and also from the top where you can see notifications and stuff. It was more convenient to use before. Also shuffle doesn't shuffle as well. It's not random enough and it's repetitive. Still a good player, just not as good as computer and prior version."
"Not exactly intuitive, takes a while to get used to, and it repeatedly wants to re-load your entire library. Also does not have full control via Bluetooth in my car (cannot select specific songs using car's controls, but at least I can skip fwd on shuffle). Sound quality is good, does not crash, and once you get used to it, it's not bad. A big plus, it plays WMA files! Much of my music became unplayable on my phone when idiots at Samsung decided to stop supporting WMA. Thank you VLC!"
"When Google Play Music was shut down, i was recommended VLC, and for the longest while, it was the best media player I've been able to find. But as of this writing, the last update they did add some features that were useful, but also broke the app. Randomly it will decide to crash, especially when trying to pick a song. Also still annoyed that it will randomly decide to reset the shuffle/repeat status for the playlist when i try to pick a new song in the same list."
"This app is pretty good. Plays a lot of file formats and does what it is intended perfectly. I can also group music/ video and make playlists. But there is really 1 feature that I feel is really missing. ""Sort by date"" in the video section. I am serious, I cannot search through all of my videos for a specific file name all the time. You can sort by date in audio, but not video. Other than that, app is great."
"I use this mainly for listening to audio books, works fine as is, but I would give it 5 stars if there was an option to go back 30 or so seconds, instead of restarting the entire track over. Sometimes I get distracted and have to pan back and it's a pain to have to open the app and input the time on the jump to option (nearly impossible to just use the slider when the content is 10 hours+)"
"I use it for listening to classical music albums. It mostly works well. The music is displayed nicely according to the metadata, and the user interface is good. Format support is good. However, the pause button has no functionality. A few minutes after clicking the pause button, the last song is no longer displayed and the place is lost. This seems like a very very basic music player function. Other music players are able to keep track of the last place in ALL the music through a history function. Unfortunately, other players have huge bugs or inept metadata handling. So VLC looks like the best at this moment."
"Use it for casting, and it's generally fantastic. I would give 5 stars, but I'm having a couple really obnoxious issues. First, when I minimize VLC while casting, it will stop playing after 30 seconds, which I have marked in settings to continue playing. Second, and worst of all, when I connect to Bluetooth, VLC will automatically open in the background and play whatever I streamed last, and there's no apparent way to stop it or even pause it. It's extremely annoying, and even reinstalled."
"Pretty much the all around best video player there is, with plenty of nifty tricks included. My only issue really is from time to time some videos will get some frame skip issue and the audio and video won't sync correctly. Haven't found a way to make those specific videos play correctly yet either. Other than that, I wouldn't choose a different one."
"The great sounding equalizer on this app needs some work. I love the save feature, but I hate that after a minor adjustment is made to it, the save feature pops up when you exit the EQ. This should be a selectable feature instead of a automatic one. Also the new snap features should stay off when it's turned off and only activate when toggled on. The VLC media player is still one of the best on the market, and has been for many years."
"This app will play just about anything you throw at it. That said I find the UI often confusing and frustrating. This is a personal opinion, your mileage may vary. I've had to clear the cache and storage on some occasions because the app seems ""stuck"" on one album with no way to return to the full list. It may be there but I haven't found it. This is particularly frustrating when using VLC in Android Auto."
"No dynamic range compression. Videos often glitch and exit, then VLC forgets where it was every single time and starts over from the beginning. Yet when I intentionally exit a video, about 33% of the time it keeps playing the audio and there seems to be no way to stop it, clicking rhe video does nothing. You have to click a microscopic triangle. Mystery meat interface is confusing in the player, too. Videos often freeze, though audio continues to work. All that said, it's the best player yet :)"
"Instead of showing every folder in the main menu, I would like to have them organized by the same parent folder structure as it is in my directories. This menu is easily cluttered if you manually organize your files with folders. Also, I've noticed a probable bug. If I select a folder in ""Media library..."", then that folder is moved into another folder that's selected, there are duplicate files in the main menu after parsing. An option to manually parse files would be nice to fix this issue."
"So far the app has been working pretty well for me, my only complaint is that when using chromecast you have to leave the app unlocked or your video will stop playing and you will have to find where you were again. When you leave it unlocked your screen will go black to save battery life and it will turn back on when you touch it, but even when unlocked it will stop playing sometimes."
"This is a great alternative music player to Samsung Music. No ads, simple to use, and supports .wav files! The only negative I have is the auto rescan option takes a little bit of time to scan all of my music when I open the app (most of it is FLAC). I can disable this, but adding or deleting music means I have to manually rescan for changes. Samsung Music does it automatically. However it's a small price to pay for an exceptional multi-media app!"
"I switched over to this app after Google dumped their music player in favor of YouTube Music (I advise against using it unless you like paying 10 bucks a month for features that use to be free via Google Play). Anyway. I thoroughly enjoy this app, my only complaint is that it seems you can't listen to individual tracks consecutively. It will play one, but then you have to go back and manually select another one to play, versus it just being able go on to the next track in the list."
"Fantastic app. Way better than the player built into my phone. But there is a glitch that didn't exist before the Dec. 23rd Update. When playing music, you used to be able to skip songs by holding the Volume buttons. Please fix this VLC!!! I hate navigating the screen in order to change to the next song. I would give 5 stars but I really hate this bug."
"The ""play as audio"" function needs some work. I frequently need to pause the video I'm listening to, and often when I press play i get an error message that says ""the location file cannot be played"" and then I have to go through my files to find the video to play it again. It happens about every other time I try to play paused audio. Even more frustrating is that when this error happens, the video progress is not saved, so I have to manually find where I left off, which is frustrating."
"Wonderful app, the best media app I've found on top of being free software. Unfortunately I've experienced a host of issues in recent versions released in November 2019. If you are having issues with SMB login, with SD card file discovery, or with seeking in certain media files, you can download the older version 3.1.7 as a temporary workaround."
I really like VLC. But there are two things I would improve. On the PC version you can go over 100%. we should be able to do this on Android because sometimes on buses I cannot hear. Also when I skip ahead the AV sync goes out. It takes forever to use the plus and minus to sync them back. It would be nice to be able to just type in a number like I can with other players I have downloaded specifically for that reason.
"Found this app to replace Google Play Music, which is going away, to play all the music I have downloaded on my Android phone. So far, so good. Really appreciate the pause/play button on my lock screen. Would like the next version to ignore ""A"" and ""The"" in titles when alphabetizing. This would make it much easier to find artists and music. Thanks. Looking forward to exploring the app more."
"Overall this is a great app. With one critical exception! Would you please allow the time to skip ahead and rewind to be adjusted. The 10 second double-tap ahead is a painful limitation to an otherwise great Audio/Video player. There should be a selection of various times such as 10s, 30s, or 5 min. Also a triple tap skip ahead feature that would triple whatever time is chosen so it then becomes 30 sec, 90 sec and 15 min respectively. Surely this is an easy fix for what's clearly an oversight."
"Good player and easy to use but has some bugs and I wish it had a few more options. If possible to add a few more options: first, to create a border for phones that have notches. Second, be able to see the properties of the file. Third, be able to rename the file from the app. Finally, it can play avi but not make playlists from it. *2020/10/17* Well, all my folder settings went down the drain but still good player"
"Long time user of VLC not just for Android but PC as well, probably as far back to one of the earliest releases. It's fairly simple to use yet packs in advanced features. Will keep using and recommending. Though, the biggest annoyance is if you pause playback then switch to another app. When switching back to VLC to resume the playlist is gone and you have to reselect files, folders or playlists. Especially annoying with large music collections."
"This is a really good universal media player. I like that it allows me to sort music files by artist, genre, etc., as well as add them to a playlist. The UI is very easy to navigate and it does what I need it to do. My one issue is that only about half my music files are showing up in the Audio screen. When I navigate to the Directory, I can find and play the files that aren't otherwise visible, but they are all stored in the same folder on an SD card, so I'm not sure why some of them don't appear in the Audio screen. It doesn't appear to be a format issue either as nearly all the music files on my card are .mp3s. If anyone has a solution please let me know because otherwise this is the best music/media player I can get on an Android device."
"The last update that was done on 8/8, has been buggy when it comes to resuming playback. It sometimes forgets where you were, other times asks if you want to resume and you have to click on in several times to get it to play back. I love this program and I use it for everything. Please fix this bug so it goes back to the way it use to be when it worked. Thank you."
"Good at everything...except seeking! Jumping forward or back using any method often results in the audio beginning to play for several seconds before the video ""catches up."" Really frustrating, since I use this feature a lot. The drag method is unique and nice for those times where double-tapping isn't appropriate. Unfortunately, due to the bug I have to rewind further than the part I want to see, making the accuracy benefits dragging brings meaningless. Please fix!"
"This is a great app, it's open source, NO ADS, and its overall great. But there is 1 issue with the audio. The pitch seems to go lower and higher depending on the music. Its not much change, mabye like 15% difference, but it's very disorienting when your listening to music. Just try to hotfix this, and make the audio at a stable 100%, and you will get your 5 stars."
"Would have rated it a 5 B4 I listened to an audiobook I downloaded on it. There is a lot to be desired as far as listening to audiobooks goes. But if all u use it for is videos, it's great. You minimize the screen to do other stuff at the same time as ur watching a video. You can even choose the size of the screen if u so choose. Leave the app and come back to the same place you left off. Same goes for audiobooks, too."
I love the Chromecast option in this app I use it to stream my files to my TV and I love that it saves where I left off but it has a bunch of bugs on the android app. 1. Subtitles don't work on Chromecast. 2. When my phone locks then I unlock it the app stops the video then restarts it. This adds like 10 seconds of black screen in middle of my video for no reason. Otherwise a great app. The pause/rewind is intuitive and the ability to download subtitles was a nice surprise.
"Great, simple music app. I don't like other apps because they all try to get you to stream, this one doesn't push stuff you don't want. I just wish that playlists were more quickly accessable when browsing your music collection: you have to leave audio and select playlists to see them, would be better if they were available via the menu at the top of the audio screen were genera, artist, album, etc. are located."
"Sometimes the app seems to lag and a few seconds of music cuts out. I'm a big fan of vlc for desktop as a music player, but the app has too much focus on videos. I wish I could customize the app to not always show the video library tabs/buttons, they take up so much extra space when you only want to use it for music. I also don't like that selecting a music track only plays that one song before stopping. Not a bad app but not the one for me."
"Generally a good experience, works well, plays all my files. My only issue is with ""shuffle"". Shuffle seems to play the same music over and over, sometimes repeating tracks on the same day. My wish would be that Shuffle doesn't repeat a track until the whole list has gotten at least one opportunity to play, remembering day after day. I have ""history"" enabled, but it doesn't make a difference"
Serious high quality audio reproduction and great video. It appears all known Codecs play. This player has some rough edges on audio though. The music tries to start before the buffer is filled and will gap on initial startup. This needs to be fixed. HD Bluetooth performance is exemplary and very high quality with excellent dynamic range and resolution. My biggest complaint: I can't seem to find ANY method of replacing missing album art from online sources. That took one star off.
Love it but one small bug. It is easy to use and not overly complex and great for all types of media I have stored on my tablet. But the only problem I see is that it is constantly loading something. I open the app and let it search my files but still doesn't go away. Even when I close the app it is still loading and uninstalling it doesn't help because it pops back up again when reinstalled.
"Great but with some playback problems. the playback feature skips ahead about 30 minutes when listening to audio books. It also does not take title info from the name of the files, and causes issues with the order of files. The issue can be fixed by making a playlist but i think there is somesort of disconnect between playlists and audio section which may be the root of the playback issue."
Almost as good as the desktop version. This app can play practically anything you need even without add-ons. Chief complaint is the shuffle function. Rather than taking all your music and making a shuffled playlist it simply grabs songs at random. Wouldn't be an issue but it doesn't then remove the song from future randoms and you will hear a lot of the same songs on loop regardless of the playlist size. Shuffle button also likes to disappear at random. No ads though which is a plus.
"I'm a long the VLC user, Linux, Windows and Android. It's been my one size fits all media player. Would love to give Android VLC 5 stars here, but one problem, when playing audio from a playlist, the equilizer keeps turning itself back on everytime I switch tracks. This is a problem because when playing audio over Bluetooth to my car stereo, the EQ is causing distortion, even when the EQ is set to flat. There doesn't seem to be an app-wide setting that disables the EQ. Am I missing something?"
"This is undoubtedly one of the best video players you can install onto your Android device. I have found plenty of room for improvement with the app. First, I would love to see a feature that allows you to change the double tap playback control to a shorter or longer length of time. Second, I frequently notice an abnormal fluctuation in the pitch of the video's audio when using the player. These are issues I think are critical and should be addressed."
"Overall good. Only issue I've noticed so far is when building playlists. Every time I add a song it clears the entire song lists. Says it can't find media. I have to back out of the app, come back in, then amazingly there are all my songs. Didn't do it at first. Started about 3/4 through building the playlists so didn't want to try uninstalling and reinstalling and lose everything. Made it slow going to finish. Thought I must've goofed something up in the settings but have tried everything."
"I hope VLC can be updated to play the MP3s inside ”Android - data - com.amazon.mp3 - files - Music - Purchased.” Update: I did get VLC to use the folder, but the equalizer seems to work only for the sound in videos, not for music in MP3s. (Also, I know Windows XP is ancient, but screenshots in the XP version of VLC take forever and cause 99% CPU usage.)"
Great app been using it for years on pc happy to see it finally on mobile. Casting to a chromecast is easy but the only negative thing I have to say is videos seem to studder with a little freeze frame every 5-7 seconds and the audio is a little off delay. However this does not happen on the pc version when I cast the same videos. I hope some tweaks will fix it up on mobile.
"I love VLC in general on my Linux desktop, Android, and more. However, this Android version is kind of odd. UI not very intuitive. Does not resume streaming after pause, either using Homescreen widget or notification shade. Have to actually go into your playlist and tap the item again. Can't argue with free and very capable player, though!"
"awesome app i have been using it for years. easiest, fastest, and most versatile. also best interface. i love how you can resume videos from the last point. great for when i download movies. one request-for the audio player i often download full albums and there is no way to resume playback from the last point like in video. could you please add that feature? otherwise i may consider finding a player that has that ability."
I use the subtitle download in this app. Unfortunately I don't seem to know what I am doing wrong. The subtitles always seem to be off either to fast or to slow it never matches the audio. I've used the. subtitle delay but pressing either plus or minus it doesn't change anything. Since I don't see instructions nor a help button I guess I can go without it.
"This app has been working great so far, especially when I have my bluetooth speakers connected to my phone. But now since I updated this app, when I'm watching my movies with my bluetooth speakers it wants to cut the audio out for a few seconds and then comes back on. And it does it about every minute through the movie. Talk about a mood killer! Please fix this problem, cause it really sucks having to watch a movie without my bluetooth speakers."
"My preferred media player, it can play basically everything sans DSD files. However, I do have some issues. The quick settings controls are a little funky in Android 11 and need refinement. Gapless playback of audio and proper audio book support would be very nice. NAS navigation is very nice, I'm glad it doesn't have to be a DLNA server. Casting to first gen Chromecasts can be a pain. Mainly the fault of the Chromecast being slow though. The interface is great though. Please don't change it!"
"Good Media Player / / I like that it can also browse to other devices on the network and supports signing into devices to view their files... / However, note that if you try to open a non-supported file type, it seems to try to open it, fail without a message and then go back to the directory screen. I wish that long-pressing on a file would allow you to open it in another app (if possible). /"
Update made it terrible to navigate. The new widget is annoying and doesn't even look close to what the widget is supposed to look like. I can't close out of a movie anymore via the widget anymore. And something was done to the movies when you click on a title. Its a pain to get it to the interface where it plays like it always has.
"The audio boost feature is very nice, but now we need a brightness boost. When watching video content that displays dark scenes on a phone in daylight, it can be very hard to see, but something amazing would be to also allow the slider to change gamma and brighten the scene that way, then it could be seen.  Likewise, darkening the image could allow dimming the phone even more than the phone brightness settings allow at 1% brightness. Please pass this on to the phone app developer."
"It's a solid app for android phones, but the only thing that kills me with this app is how the shuffle button doesn't actually shuffle correctly. You can end up playing the same song you heard 10 songs ago depending on how many you have in your playlist, where as something like iTunes doesn't allow that to happen."
probably the best mobile video player app. Problems to fix: 1. video rate speed goes down to 25% would be nice to have it come down to 3 fps like the desktop version. 2. somehow incorporate a frame by frame forward button. and a back 1 frame by frame would be awesome if possible 3. The play from A;B does not work well. it is awkward to set with the menu and you can only set it with the video playing. Things to add like the PC version:
"Gets 4 stars simply because it works. It plays any and all video file types. That's what matter. Now, functionality could be improved. Lots of great features, they're just glitchy. I have 2 big issues with glitches. One is that my place is always lost. Like if I get a text I'll go to respond then when I come back my video either goes back to the beginning or VLC just fails and restarts. The second is with playlists. They also don't save my spot. Playlists also often fail to mark as watched."
"Very useful, however I have two issues. When you are casting to another device, it displays only a black screen and I end up locking my phone trying to turn it on. Also, it seems to cut out randomly while casting. I'll be watching a movie and it will close out on my Chromecast. Other than that it's very useful!"
"I use VLC for literally every audio and video file, have been for years, because it can read nearly every format. Only problem is that on my Samsung galaxy A71 when I pause a video or music and wait say like 5 minutes and go to stay out again it tells me the file location is missing. So I have to open the app and restart the song or movie. Other than that great app would definitely recommend."
"This app has greatly improved for both my phone and Chromebook! I'd installed VLC some time ago. It had poor usability, lost playlists and not picking up stored music, so I uninstalled it. Later, I installed the Fermata app which advised to add VLC for better performance. The Fermata app went bad, so I used the current version of the VLC app and it works great! Much better functionality, it picked up all of my music, and it's much easier to create playlists, and so far hasn't lost them! Great! Update: 11/10/2021 - My phone, a Moto G Power 2021, had a Motorola system update today and all but two of my playlists had the songs removed! I still seem to have all my music but the playlists, except for two of them, have lost all of their songs! They were there as of last Friday, 11/5/2021. At least the app didn't lose my music entirely, only the music in the playlists that I created with my music, but this is still very frustrating as I had made up about 27 playlists. The playlists on my Chromebook, also using a VLC app for Chromebook, are still there and intact. What I really long for is an app that is like the media player on Windows, the earlier version that I've used since Windows XP and have installed on my laptops since from Win 7 through 10. All along the way, the Media Player always picked up all my songs and playlists and I never had to remake the playlists, even when upgrading to the next Windows OS! And Windows Media Player has never lost any of my music or songs in my playlists because of any updates from Windows or any other updates! An app like Windows Media Player, with it's ease of use, especially where creating and retaining playlists are concerned, that would recognize the playlists that have been synced to my phone, pick them up as is so I wouldn't even have to recreate them on the phone app, and never lose them regardless of any updates of any kind, would be great! But so far I've never found one! And to note, the Windows Media Player has been around since at least 2006, so it's abilities are not new technology. I still think that VLC is still a good app as it hasn't lost my music and also plays videos well and has a lot more functionality that it once did, but I know it can be made better, especially for those of us who like to create their own playlists and not have the songs in them disappear from the playlists leaving the playlists empty. It would be great if VLC for Android and Chromebook could be tweaked to have the kind of functionality that Windows Media Player has. I imagine this would make VLC the greatest and best music and media playing app for Android by a truly huge margin! And the app developers would most likely benefit, too! To the developers: If you want to learn more about my experiences in using Windows Media Player in using and creating playlists to get an idea of what I, and possibly others who like creating their own playlists, are looking for, please let me know, as I'm willing to help improve the VLC app if possible. Thanks!"
"I wish it had Google driving mode capability. I cant switch songs while driving as it always defaults to YouTube. I want to listen to The Wall on my phone without YouTube's PayWall. I have the whole album but not hands to spare at 60MPH. I also can't get it to start as part of my morning alarm. Great app, compatibility with almost any file type you find."
"3.5 version: Latest version has a problem where if you resume your playlist it doesn't have the ID tags. Big problem when using last.fm scrobbler. | Good but needs improvement. Everytime I restart my phone/VLC media player closes it rescans media forcing you to wait for it to reload your library. You are unable to fix or add album art, either it needs to be imbedded into the mp3 files or put in the folder. You have to remove the files refresh showing the music is no longer there and put it back."
"Almost perfect. VLC has so far been pretty stable, and most features are elegant and enjoyable. Heres a small list of problems: When playback of a playlist begins, or there isn't a song currently cached, VLC will cut out the first couple seconds of a song. Parsing takes WAY too long, in my opinion. I'm switching over from EQ Media Player, every time I changed a tag, or added a new song, I'd have to rescan. But, EQ rescanned my 800 song playlist in seconds. VLC takes upwards of 2.5 minutes."
"The only reason I'm not giving this app all five stars is due to the lack of ability to show the LYRICS value (to be fair, the desktop version is incapable of this as well), and (though I haven't tested) I'm unaware if you can modify the tags of media files in the Android version. Other than that, perfect and very comprehensive media player!"
"I've been a long time user of this app for mostly music for years across multiple phones (about 6 years) and I dunno what it was about the last update, but the app is now much more needlessly cumbersome. Moving songs within playlists is harder, and now it just flat out refuses to play some of my songs regardless if I am playing the song in a playlist or not. I tried some other music players on the songs in question, and worked fine. (I recently upgraded my SD card to a 500gb card)"
"Well, everyone is right. This latest update sucks. Used it after the update and it only loaded 1 of the 20 albums I currently have on my phone and it wouldn't scan my directories to find them. Plus, when browsing through said folders containing my music, they were showing as empty. So I was about to uninstall... ... until I cleared the app's cache, then hit the clear data button. Now, once I restarted VLC, it scanned and found all my music and videos. Haven't looked at any other features yet."
"Great app, I use it for most of my music now that google play music is dead. There are two minor but annoying bugs though. First, VLC doesn't find album art stored as an image in the same folder as the music, no matter the name. This is very, very annoying. VLC will pick up on album art in id3 tags, but this is wasteful. Second, if I pause playback at 1.5x speed or something and resume it from the notification after closing the app, it returns to 1.0x"
"I've used & loved VLC on many devices & OS's. It was my ""go to"" app for all audio/video. Never had any issues 'til recent Android update(s). Now it won't even play 1 song fully. Keeps stopping them midway or sooner. Annoying & inconvenient esp. when about to drive—set up playlist, Bluetooth phone to car stereo—expecting to jam the whole way, but can't even hear 1 song in full. Reinstalled, tried all online fixes—no help! Dangerous to change songs while driving; had to switch to π. Please fix, TY"
"For those of you having playback issues where it stops after a few seconds to a minute, all you have to do is uninstall and reinstall VLC. Streaming, playing MP3s, etc. Now all play fine without stopping (unless there's an internet issue but that's different). I love this app. Good luck!"
It's the best video player out there. For a while it was also the main music app on an old phone I was using as an audio player. It got very sluggish and took over a half an hour to scan the music folder. It was getting bogged down by the thousands of album covers it had copied to thumbnail files. Only deleting the imbedded album art from evey MP3 file helped. Since then I limit the scan to video folders on my main phone and use a more appropriate audio player on both devices.
"Been using it for years on my laptop due to hearing impairment and the fact that it can exceed 100% volume both with and without headphones. Got it for my phone awhile back and was very very happy however somethings were taken off that kinda upset me. 1. The music only area no longer exceeds 100% volume, only the video can on phone now... and 2. You cannot view a playlists duration anymore. If those could be implemented again I would be very very grateful."
"The update before the this last update I think messed with the app. for about maybe a week or so I didnt see anything wrong, but two days ago it made all the video picture previews become the same picture. there are still a few with the correct preview picture but the majority of them are the same picture. already tried deleting the data and resyncing my videos but it didn't fix anything. plz fix cuz you're the only player 8 like on Android."
"I love VLC. I use nothing else for playing video content. However, casting to my Chromecast device on my television. Has proven to be a pain. Sometimes it works, sometimes it plays but is super choppy, and sometimes the video simply won't cast. I'm not sure if this is a Chromecast or VLC issue, but I'd love some feedback."
"Love the app and know it's capabilities, so purely because of its availability on Android I had to have it. There's a big issue I'd note, which didn't happen until mid 2019 (unsure if caused by updates): the app will keep opening itself automatically, either out of nowhere or after use. It'll do it and interrupt other apps, and continues nonstop, neverending... Uninstalling and reinstalling temporarily fixes the issue until it eventually happens again. Device: Moto Z3"
"Best audio player I've found so far, but resume seems busted. If I pause using my headphones I can't resume without killing the app off and reloading, and even then if I miss the prompt to resume, it forgets what you were listening to. Still very good but that's a bit annoying."
"The only reason this is not 5 stars is that 1)I've never been able to figure out how to use all the features, and 2)everytime I download CL the controls have changed; like this time, they is no next /previous buttons on vids. Maybe I can change it in settings. One time I was able to watch a vid from a website, but was not able to do it again. I would REALLY like to do that. But over all I line it and keep it on my phone and laptop(along with IrfanView), and considering the copycats it s the best"
Just switched from a Galaxy S7 Edge to a Pixel 3 XL - honestly didn't realize how much functionality I lost from Samsung's UI to stock Android but the worst thing was that a lot of my music files were either missing info or album art (or straight-up couldn't play consistently) on Hash Music player or Google Play music. Though the UI could use some work as far as playlist creation goes (bulk adding songs to playlists would be nice) only this app consistently played all my songs/showed all info.
"It's strange 10+ years ago when I first used VLC on PC I never had problems playing videos. For some reason the app now has 5x more settings, tweaks & customizations that's cool and all, but now it has to ""convert"" my files [while its playing?] Which 75% of the time means my $300 samsung galaxy A10e doesnt have the memory or processor capability to maintain a stable conversion often when I'm not even using the phone watching the video casted to my tv... now I'm no dev. But I think it's now worse"
Music is radomly pausing. Sometimes the music player stop the music and then auto closes itself. Please fix this issue as it is very annoying and irritating. Music in playlists is not properly organized alphabetically and sommetimes duplicates of the same song are in the playlist when i only have 1 copy. Other than that its a great app.
"Has been my go to media player, but the most recent update (3.5) broke resuming-playback badly. Plugging in headphones or connecting to a Bluetooth audio device no longer resumes, requiring me to authenticate to the phone and dig for the Resume option (no longer eyes-free). Additionally the notification widget randomly disappears. I hope the next update fixes the issue."
Love the app used to giving it 5 stars. However in the last 2 versions when you sync the phone to any Bluetooth audio system vlc automatically starts to play even if the app is 100% closed out. Unable to find any settings in VLC to disable that. This gets very frustrating aspeshly if one is driving. Wish that would be optional to have vlc load by Bluetooth connection not every time I sync it to an audio system.
"Great app and I use the desktop version as well. There are some issues to consider. When I pause and open another app and return to vlc from recent apps menu, it doesn't open on the first try and it does on the second. Also when it does resume, the first two seconds get muted and the sound is cutting. Another issue I had with subtitles, they work initially but when I return to vlc after using other apps, I need to enable and choose the subtitle file again."
"Wished the sort filter had the ""date added"" included like before. Now, you have three choices: name, file name, and length. Not sure what the difference is between the first two choices, seems redundant. This is my preferred app to play my media. Keep up the good work."
Plays anything you throw at it just like the PC version. Awesome player. I just wish they had an option to sort the video by the date added. It would save a lot of time if the video I just added and want to watch could just be at the top instead of searching for it. Just more sort options In general would make the experience much better imo.
"I love the sound quality, the UI, gestures, almost everything. The only problem is the search 🔍. It dissapears when I'm searching for music and the keyboard doesn't show up until I switch to the album tab and then back to tracks a couple of times till it shows up again."
"Works fantastic but I do have 2 issues. 1. Constantly getting the message to give all access after it already has it. 2. When starting audio when connected to a bluetooth device; tested on headphones, my car, and a speaker; the audio cuts out for roughly 3 seconds before coming back in at the start on all audio files."
"This is basically what Samsung Music used to be before Samsung added ads and ruined it. The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because there's a playback issue on Bluetooth and on physical (3.5mm plug) audio where it stutters and skips occasionally, especially during songs longer than 6 minutes, and it's never consistent. Sometimes listening to a song repeatedly fixes the problem, other times it makes it worse. It's like the app is buffering the track while it's playing."
"VLC is a go to on all of my devices. No other media app offers the gamut of options nor stability which VLC offers. The fact that they are cross platform without loss of integrity shows how hard the developers work at making sure we have a reliable player which works right out of the box. I could be wrong, because I have not search for one, but a user manual would be extremely helpful for truly fine tuning the player but with VLC as your player - there hardly is a need to download anything else."
Works great on Android for my SMB server. Which sadly other apps do not. But the latest 3.50 update has broken something with upnp support. Networked files randomly stop being visible. The only fix is to manually download and install the last version from their website. But be warned it seems Android seems to also wipe all of your settings and playlists when you uninstall. Make sure to backup... I lost all my playlists 😖
Options and features galore. This is an amazing in it's class. If it wasn't for differences with the interface as well as usability (Not Functionality) I would have rated VLC for Android 5 stars. I do realize that's more of a user error issue. I also prefer the Desktop app so maybe I'm biased.
"I have downloaded skins for the player going back six or seven years now. Probably four different times, and Every.Single.Time afterward the crashes and runs choppy and seemingly bogged down. I get rid of skins, un and reinstall VLC and it's fine. After acquiring skins, particularly with video, I successfully skip tracks MAYBE once in every five tries. It freezes up and/or shuts down or you have to manually restart it. I can live without skins, otherwise I LOVE It! Would be nice though if..."
When will .cue files start working for android? One more thing. When playing a video watching it all the way through and then watching it later the video starts from the end with only few seconds. Clearing my playback history and restarting helps though only for one play through. Then I have to repeat the clearing playback after every watch through. Its only a minor annoyance but to backtrack clearing my playback isnt fun. Glad yall never littered your app with ads nice clean experience.
"This is an amazing app that works perfectly in almost every way for listening to downloaded music. Although I am a bit disappointed to see the removal of the ""exclusive headset remote control"" option, as it makes it difficult to skip tracks without pulling out your phone"
"This app is pretty good, the only reason I'm giving it a 4 star rating is because there are better apps available. I use MX Player because for some reason VLC can take several minutes to fully parse my music folder when I add new music to it, MX Player doesn't have this issue and is able to scan the entire folder in just a few seconds. Although, VLC is smaller than MX Player, so if your short on space, VLC might be the better option."
"The free content ends right after the first lesson, learning the five notes of the left hand. A bit light before shelling out a subscription. Still, that's their business model, so I can't really fault them too much for that. The app seemed to have a good system of microphone note detection, that hooked up well with the sheet music playback. Maybe another time I'll shell out for it, but as I'm just trying to break into this hobby, I think I've like to at least bring the left hand into it first."
"Nice but very horrible MIDI. I tried out the 7 day free trial and was able to get through a couple of lessons no problem. But when I got to Essentials I, it started having connection issues. I use a Casiotone CT-S300 and plugged it in via MIDI by usb micro to usb c cable. It worked great... Once. When I pressed a key on the keyboard, it somehow just stopped registering notes and disconnected when I went into settings. I'm not sure why it's doing this, I don't know if it's my device or not."
Is very good and easy to learn notes with... Edit it was easy when they taught you the first I think it is three lessons then they wouldn't let you use the app anymore unless you pay.. that's why I gave it a four star if I could afford it this is the best app I've ever seen you don't even need to use midi chords it listens to your piano playing and will tell you when it's off and it works perfect. I just wish it was cheaper...
"I got this app for both myself and my 9 yr old brother. We like it and it makes learning more fun. There are 5 min workouts you can do when you don't want to do a full lesson but want to keep up. However, I was charged $89.99 twice. I emailed them and they were able to resolve it though. There are also some issues with note recognition but not enough (yet - I am on Essentials 2) to be impossible to ignore. May try the midi adapter. Wish some of the songs were longer!"
"We managed to install an Android OS on the PC and now the app works great on a large screen. No lag or jerkiness. My daughter and I both are having great success with it. Much better than Flowkey. Extremely interactive and well thought out. Stay the course, even when frustrating. You will see that it all comes together. Not perfect. But what is? One feature that should be available. Ability to slow down some songs instead of waiting for practice mode to hit. Kids get frustrated."
"This is a fantastic app for helping learn piano! It progresses at the perfect rate and helps you pick things up quickly. However, sometimes the app has a difficult time picking up all the notes being played (especially if it is a chord). Therefore, I end up having to repeat a lot of things and slamming on the keys just for it to hear correctly."
"Great app. You can learn piano easily and in a fun way but I do have 1 complaint: Premium. You can barely do anything unless you pay, at least make Essentials I free. Also, in some of the advertisements, it said that with only 1 week you could play a good song. I have been using this for over a month, about 30 mins a day, and the song played in the ad is still pretty hard for me. Again, this is a great way to learn piano even from scratch."
"over all great. but the app.is having a really hard time identifying the cords when I play. meaning I'm playing the cord right but it does not pick up on one of the notes and it counts it as an error which makes it really hard to.kove on, because I'm having to constantly start songs and practices over and over. I have a piano not a keyboard, so I cant turn the volume up."
"Pretty decent app for getting started learning the piano. It doesn't go over anything about music theory or anything, so me, starting with no background at all, was confused by some things. Would have been nice for more introductory stuff to have been... introduced. Also, the really most frustrating thing, and it's probably just a hardware issue, but this app is terrible at detecting simultaneous notes. Like, it'll tell you to play a G C E chord and the app will only detect one or two of them."
"It has it's small glitches, like counting one key tone for two, and passing a level up despite in making a few mistakes. But to me it's minimal because I personally know that it did it wrong and one way or another I will compensate for that. And once you get it, it will be because the app was helpful. Not perfect...but still very helpful."
"Um, well I have had a nice time and have legitimately been learning, I have gotten up to Intermediate 2. The major issues I have been having are 1) that not every note I play seems to get recognized and 2) usually that's not a big problem since it allows for some leeway and doesnt require it done perfectly but in Intermediate 2, when we are forced to learn Greek Wedding to progress, halfway through it, just as it gets complicated, it decided it has to register every note. 23 tries, am stuck."
My fingers are learning to play in a fun environment that I can jump on when there is time. I love the variety of songs. I do wish you could rewind to a specific if section instead of having to replay the whole song or go back to the practice lesson. The only problem I've run into is my phone not always picking up all the note on certain chores. I am really enjoying playing though; more than I thought I would.
"Now that I have the midi cable connecting the phone to the keyboard it works soooo much better because it recognizes the notes. The only problem is that now with the cable the scrolling of the notes often lags behind by a second. You need to follow your internal metronome, not the notes. Then it speeds up and catches up. I'm really enjoying the method. Good amount of practice and then songs to train. Joytunes charged me twice but I complained and they promptly refunded the erroneous charge."
I really like the app and I can see why it's popular and why it's getting advertisement slots all over the place. I did the first set of lessons and now I can read some sheet music. I enjoy the way it formats and it's good at teaching. The downside is that after you get through the first set of lessons and before you get to play the songs you like you have to become a premium member (or use the free trial). It's dissapointing because it seems free but it really isn't.
"Good self learning tool. I signed up for 3 months to begin, and liked it enough to sign up for another 6 months. It does a good job teaching and allowing me to pace. I wish it had an option to rewind to a certain part of a song to practice when I struggle with one area. Be nice to have a built in help feature, where it does the tick tock thing upon request in an area. It sometimes does not catch certain notes, but overall, I'm really enjoying it"
"Using with midi connection for a couple weeks now. Pretty solid. Making good progress while having fun. Difficulty seems to have ramped up significantly after flats and sharps are introduced, not just because of the additional notes, but song speed increased as well making things rather difficult. I think it could use some work on what counts as a ""correct"" key press. If I mash every key repeatedly it counts the whole section as a success with no penalty for the incorrect key presses."
"While it is the best app for learning piano out there in my opinion, it has a few flaws that are holding me up from rating it 5 stars. 1 - Allow learners to practice the same exercises until they perfect it instead of moving forward automatically without a ""back"" button. 2 - After succeeding the practice exercise, learners will be presented with the screen with the music to play along. The background music is louder than the piano making it very easy to loose focus. Pls, add volume control."
"I really enjoy the app. I wish I could customize further though. I would like for the sheet music library to have an option to have a backing track with adjustable tempo. I also would like to skip some levels that are just out in the weeds with chores - sometimes it puts me to sleep! I have to say I LOVE the moments where it takes a step back at the full band. For example, in the part where you alternate 1 and 5 in the base and chores in the right, it explains you're playing kick and share."
"This is an excellent way to learn. I would rather play piano using the app rather than play using sheet music. Tha app sets the pace and it is a matter of keeping up. BTW, you can adjust the pace when learning a song at 60% and 80%. The only grip I have is sometimes the app doesn't hear a particular note. It doesn't happen enough to discourage me. For my 64 year old self, I am amazed what this app has taught me. As I have progressed, I have learned to read music easily."
"This is a great, fun app. I love it. One comment: I have a phone without a working headphone jack, so I'm relegated to a situation where it turns down the audio to near-zero, on the very play-along levels where it wants you to hit the notes in time with the music -- but you can't hear the rhythm then, right? What would be *really* great, would be to have that metronome there (from the slow levels) at *all* times. Something I could always tap along to."
"Good app for starting out. Teaches you a lot of concepts well. The scrolling music makes it easy to pick up and play. The note recognition sucks by sound, but if you get a midi cord it works great. Note for the devs, the numbers/letters for the fingers and chords are too frequent. It is easy to fall in the habit of just looking for the number instead of the note on the scale. Also, practice mode is the worst. Add a skip option, just let me keep trying it I don't want the hand holding."
The exercises are great! Just frustrating when it doesnt pick up the sounds...usually a problem at the very beginning of a song or exercise. If I remember and play those first notes a little louder it seems to help. I am using other forms of learning so I dont know how this would do as a stand a lone training but it is definitely a very helpful addition. Would recommend.
Really great for learning the basics and advancing to new skills. It pushes through new songs a little too quickly though. It would be nice if there was a practice mode of each song that was 3/4 the speed. The current practice mode goes at a snail's pace and always cuts off right before the point in the song I'm struggling with.
"I did choose a premium package but am not seeing any ads. So far, the timing is a bit off, so if you're an actual trained musician trying to use it to learn play, this can be disruptive/annoying, but it's just a lag on the program and you'll adapt. I would probably recommend they add a metronome to ALL the lessons, not the practice ones, so that people with no background get the idea of what note values really are. I need to learn bass clef and this is a decent tool."
"Really good app to learn and teach you proper techniques. Plenty of songs so you're not playing hot cross buns all the time. Unfortunately, frequently lags at the most inconvenient time when auto scrolling a song. Android version is sorta wonky in that keeps giving me an error message about unable to download a file, but if I dismiss the message (which has to be done a lot), I have full functionality. Even with its imperfections, still way better than other apps I've tried."
"needs work..... the metronome is distracting, especially when it pops up mid song... and is infuriating.... slow... also.. it should be optional, with the ability to disable completely, in settings... speaking of settings vary... little as for phone or audio fix.... I'm running this on a note 9 pro... and the app has trouble hearing no matter how close to the speaker.. also subscription to use, really... no a one time perchance... I would rather pay for piano lessons.... but definitely decent."
it is a very easy and user friendly program. you play songs and read music from the start. not sure if I will continue but I will find out once the trial is over. only issue I had was getting the audio to recognize I was playing. the instructions said to give permission for mic use when it asks for it. my program never asked. I eventually figured out that it had to be done in the app settings not phone settings. once that was done I was on my way. thank you for a wonderful app.
"5 stars if your audio and video lines up. 3 stars if it doesn't. On my phone the video blue line is about a half beat off from the audio. I think a lot of people have this problem and it is causing them to ""miss"" notes falsely. On my wife's phone it actually works properly and then it is an awesome app worth the money."
"It works fairly well. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I can learn. However, the subscription is incredibly expensive. On top of this, the app frequently lags and glitches. Often times when switching between courses and songs, the screen goes black and I am kicked out of the app. Overall very useful, but there are things that can be improved upon."
"Trying to learn from a book has always proven difficult for me. The cool thing about this app is how accesible it is (minus the $90 price point- but that's besides the point). When I say accessible, I mean it really does teach you techniques and songs that you'd learn from a book, but also is waaaaay more interactive. I've given the app a four because I feel there's room for improvement. I just practiced ""Vivaldi's Spring"", and that song is crazy fast! Whenever I mess up, the app puts you in practice mode, but even that's fast. Therefore my technique barely improves, and I feel sloppy playing. Please add speed controls. Also, the ability to break each ""module"" into different sections, where I'm able to select an exact portion of a song to practice just that part. That would be very helpful. In all though, for $90, I think this app is truly worth what the developers are asking. I mean, think about how much a single lesson with one teacher costs, you know? Anyway... One more thing, (I know this is definitely a long shot) please add more Blues lessons if all possible. Last thing I swear, the five minute lessons could use a revamp. They should be more in depth I believe, in that it should be able to help me in areas the app recognizes I need to focus more on. Edit: 20181009 Forgot to mention one thing in my initial review, please add the option to disable the note/chord identifiers. I find myself just relying on those and not focusing on the sheet."
"Overall it's good. Just sometimes it automatically turns the bluetooth on. Bluetooth makes this app not hear anything at all, so you have to go to settings and turn the bluetooth off. Also, if you have one of these keyboards where you could control the volume, make sure it doesn't go too low unless you have the cord MIDI. It sometimes doesn't hear that well if you turn the sound low because it would hear less sound."
I've been using this for about a month and I like it! Definitely feels like I'm improving and the lessons are getting more challenging. The issues I have are: 1. It forces you to play some really awful pop music in order to progress. I know it's completely subjective but... 2.You can pretty much mash your keyboard to get through songs. Use the app as a guide but determine for yourself if you actually played well. 3. I wish I could pause and go back a few bars in a song instead of staring over!
"It definitely helps with getting acquainted with the piano, and it's fun learning the chords to some popular songs! I also enjoy the music sheets they occasionally supply you with! Only thing is that once you start to play chords, the app had trouble identifying which keys were being hit. Without the adapter to my keyboard, it was impossible for me to progress."
"Im only giving this a 4 because when you finish one course then evreything else is premium. You either have to have a 7 day FREE trial witch still makes you put your credit card number and stuff on it. After that trial if you dont cancel it will take money. I just wish more things were free, but besides that I Recommend this game, I learned so much Piano! Just fix that one problem I think you'll get more people: )"
"Seems good but I would like more variation in the subscription. I have alot of money in my google play wallet and it would be nice to use that as a form of payment for this. Also I don't want to have to pay large sums for several months. Please add single month subscriptions, that way we can pay and play as needed. I'd love to progress into the other courses but I can't commit to $110+"
"This app takes each aspect of learning the piano step by step. I'm currently on the third lesson and throughout each part of the lessons you gain new songs to learn and play. I couldn't give the app 5 stars mainly because if you're a true beginner, you most likely have no experience reading music. I think the app should focus more on learning to read the music given rather than labeling the notes with the numbers of your fingers. This makes it harder to learn personally."
"It's a great app, generally speaking, but just recently I've been having a problem where the song volume is *automatically* decreased before the notes even start appearing for me to play. This has been happening the past few days, even when I use headphones. It's extremely annoying... I tried to contact support through the app but there's no place to actually type out what issue I'm having - there are only preset options I can select, and this issue isn't related to any currently listed."
"This app is pretty good. I really like that they extended the library with the Play Beta. It doesn't pick up you're notes sometimes, but since it's a beta model I kinda saw that coming. It picks up all my notes if I play in 8-bit. If it doesn't annoy you, try playing in that setting lol. Try to get it on your phone or tablet so you can put it right next to your keyboard speaker. I'm using it on a computer so it's a bit harder. 9/10."
"Very easy to learn piano. Even for slow-to-catch-on students like me, you can review and review until you master it. You are playing actual songs from the very beginning which is very encouraging. Only drawback is that the app freezes from time to time and your practice gets interrupted."
I just started using this app as a beginner and it is amazing! it teaches you the basics and gives you tips on how you are playing. The mic could use some improvement. The app doesn't always pick up the note you play. there is also a monthly payment after the basics of piano playing. I think the payment is worth the money. It gives you different contracts to sign up for and you can cancel the payment at anytime you want. Overall I think this app is a great way to start of your piano dream.
"I love this app! I got it because during quarantine I wanted to learn to keep busy but I didn't want to start from online classes. My sister goes to lessons for $40 every 30 min! That's more than a dollar a minute! This was way cheaper and it is almost as good as a real teacher, if not the same. It listens to you and corrects you. The only problem (if you have a electric piano) turn it up for it to hear you. Sometimes it says I'm wrong even when I have the write note. That could just be my mic."
"Do not install if you want something free, you can only learn the very basics then you have to pay for more lessons. From my experience, (I only did the free lesson) it seems like the app would help you learn piano. Install on an iPad or tablet if you are learning without a piano, the keys are too small to tap on a phone. (The phone works fine with an actual piano or key board.) I like that newer music is incorporated. Free part of the app was good."
"Great, intuitive lessons, and extensive song library - easily my favorite piano app. The only major drawback is that it misses a few vital features, like the ability to search unlocked songs or jump to the first incomplete lesson from the Courses screen, resulting in a LOT of cumbersome scrolling time the more progress you make."
"I'm loving the app now that I have it on iPad. I bought a Galaxy Tab A specifically for this and it skips and makes me mess up notes. I got an iPad and it works way better and it turns out they designed the app to be A LOT better on iOS. Not only does it run better but there's way more functionality and it's prettier. Also, using midi solves all the note recognition issues. And for the ones complaining about the price, an app like this isn't going to be free. It's way cheaper than lessons."
What annoyed me: The application locks content behind progression. Coming into the app already knowing C major is frustrating as I'm stuck having to play through the content. Once I was able to unlock songs to play I found I could only play a portion of the song and not the entire song which I'm not sure is due to the low level or of only samplings of songs are provided. Inability to adjust volume on the app. My piano is blasting at full volume and it still automatically adjusts sound.
"This is just a little feedback for simply piano. The app is great! There is just one problem, which is premium. I think it's a smart idea,but you use it to much. Some people really want to learn piano and your practically taking that away from people who can't afford it. Mabye premium could only come up if you want to skip to a lesson."
Great app if you have a MIDI connection. The app often didn't pick up notes by hearing them. We bought a new keyboard with MIDI and now it works great. I took away 1 star because when playing it hangs up and sometimes doesn't count a note as it skips forward. My 11 yo son is doing quite well doing 10-20 minutes daily. I'm relearning after a couple decades not playing. I like that it uses modern and famous songs to help you get a feeling for the notes.
"This app would be 5 star all the way if the developers would implement a way to slow the tempo on the lessons, as well, make it simpler to go back and review the lesson pieces instead of having to go all the way back through the process. The 2nd part is just being a tad picky I guess but it would be nice to be able to slow the tempos while learning pieces."
"I'm really enjoying it and appreciate the app. Been trying to make myself learn for years but this is the first time I've ever made real progress. My one complaint that I ask you fix is allow us to put start stop points in songs. Sometimes I really need to just practice the end, have the beginning part perfect but I have to reply the beginning every time I want to practice the end. Super hard to perfect the end this way. Thanks"
"My kids really like the app. However, we were unable to install the app on our laptop. Worse was that there was not an expressed way to cancel the trial period before the subscription would come into effect. I think the app is well worth the offering. If this setup is a method for securing subscriptions without allowing the potential buyer to cancel within the trial period, that is a deal breaker for me."
"I like this app. It is great for online piano lessons. But there is one problem that im getting very annoyed with. It does not read the notes very well. I put it on the best spot possible for it to hear my piano and i put headphones on. But it still is not reading the notes. I click the note 20 times and it still will not work. Other than that, your app is great!"
"I've tried several different piano learning apps and let me tell you the lesson layout is amazing. Its tedious at times, as it should be, but skipping chapters can alleviate the stress of that. The only huge disappointment I have is how outdated the Android version is to the IOS version. Give us a beta or something!"
Pretty good for beginners. Android version. Pros: Great short videos.Lots of songs to practice.Great note recognition with digital keyboard connected to the app. Cons: Sometes app won't recognize notes without a connection. Volume auto decreases without an option to turn the volume up.Limited classical songs. The song display list has no search function
"Updated review. So I gave it a 5 initially cause i really loved the early lessons. Then as I advanced and learned more notes, dropped my rating to a 3 because the app was not picking up the d note on the bass scale most the time. That's still an issue, but it hasn't caused as much of a problem after Essentials 3. And I'm back in the groove on chord stylings 3. And I feel like I've advanced so much in such a short time. So lets settle on 4 stars."
"Four stars, very easy to use, makes playing the piano looks so simple. I appreciate the numbers and how slow they take the pace. The only one complaint I would give about it Is the sound recording. it picks up little sounds in my house so when I play the right note, it picks it up as the wrong note. but overall awesome!"
"Great except for a couple of issues. Multiple times per practice session the app just stops hearing notes played on the external keyboard. Restarting the app has fixed this so far but it is annoying. The introductory lessons could use additional tunes. Atm. Each new skill is built on one song. In order to learn a new song, additional techniques need to be learned. When the curve becomes too steep, the student is stuck on one song. This means playing old songs is boring and new ones too hard."
"This app is great for learning the basics. But once you reach higher difficulty lessons you encounter problems with the app's sound detection software, and it crashes usually after one or two hours of use. It is a very fun learning experience, though."
Great app I am learning alot! My only complaint is sometimes music plays off beat with notes shown on screen and the only solution I can come up with is to uninstall the app and reinstall. This has happened 4-5 times in about 2 months. If there is better solution please let me know.
"Okay I like the app it's great and all but please I encourage the developers to add harder content for songs for example it these can be a system in where you master the easiest version and go on to the next harder version of that song I just do not like that the developers just put the easier if not the easiest version of the song and move on to the next one. And another thing:PLEASE put more diverse classical music songs I only see spring, Mozart, and new world and nothing else."
Great App with a few problems. Sometimes the app has a hard time hearing each not so it will say you played it wrong when you are on the right keys. Every once in a while it will glitch and not hear anything you are playing. I would like for it to teach counts and it hasn't yet. Over all it has been very useful. I would download again and recommend to friends.
"The app has been great up until the chords section. It has trouble hearing the full chords, but my midi to USB and USB to USB type C into my phone helped. Also the music that plays along lags what the user is supposed to play on my Pixel 3 Android Version 10 It'd be nice to have a calibration to be able to fix that issue. Works great on my older Samsung tablet."
"It's a great way to learn piano and all- but, sometimes it doesn't hear me playing, I would like if you improved this. And today, I don't know why, but it showed that I didn't do Essentials 1, I did, but it said I didn't —except it was on songs—. Please fix this aswell. Other than that, a great app to get! I highly recommend it for piano players of any level! :)"
"This app is very helpful and easy to use. The only thing that I don't appreciate about this app is that sometimes the app malfunctions and plays the songs faster than they should, which discourages me as a pianist by making me feel that I am not good enough to play that song. I would deeply appreciate if someone would fix this. Thank you. ( Also, if you are thinking about downloading this app, I would recamend you to make sure you have an MDI, or the app has difficulty hearing your piano)"
"Okay, so this is a great app except for one thing, and thats the fact that the app doesn't hear about an eighth of the notes. I play on a keyboard so it might not come out as clear but I turn the volume up to about 90% and I still have to redo the entire song (if it's a course song) if it doesn't hear the notes I play. Otherwise it is a pretty good app. it has no ads and it's an easier way to learn piano. If you could change this then I would give it five stars."
"I was challenged to repeat and think things through, especially with the sequences of the numbers and letters. I love the Practice Activation, when I got too many wrong notes to guide me to refocus. The task was daunting at first, but I was challenged to use my fingers instead my eyes to hit the right notes. You guys put together a very nice system here. Thank you."
"It's very awesome, I've always wanted to learn the piano, but didn't really know where to start. With this I can start practicing to actually learn it, only complaint, the sound detection is sometimes detects it, or doesn't at all, I had my keyboard turned all the way up, and I placed my phone right next to it as close I could, and it wouldn't say i was playing the key, even in sitting there spamming they key hoping it would detect it. So that got extremely frustrating."
Great app. Really easy to use. Really helpful. It tells you what notes you get right or wrong. My only problem is when I searched piano learning for free this came up. Only the basics are for free. You have to pay for basically anything else. You have to pay to be able to play any song. Great app if your willing to pay.
Really good app for all ages. Using an usb cable does help with note recognition quite a bit. The main issue is the app stability (freezes and closes randomly) and lack of customization like other people are saying. Otherwise it is a really good way to get into piano!
"This app is great, I have 2 things that would make it even better. First is the speed when learning each part of the song, its just too fast many times, speed can be lowered when playing whole song which is great but the learning part should have slower mode as well. Second more important is when playing whole song its very annoying there is no option to slide the song to the part where I made the mistake but I must start the song from beginning, it would help lots with the learning process."
"Pretty good even for amateurs. I recommend learning sheet music though, it's much more difficult without it. Couldn't connect with my printer but I think that's just a me problem."
This is a great app for learning to play the piano. I have to say though that the iOS version is much better. The Android interface doesn't have the same song layout with pictures etc. The main issue for me is the note recognition. If you want to charge your tablet and connect midi at the same time via an adapter its fine on iOS but doesn't work on Android...in fact midi in general is abit hit and miss on Android version. When it lowers the volume for better recognition it is frustrating.
"Really good app, although last update has a bug. Opening songs from play tab crashes the app. Crash happens immediately after clicking on song tile in this tab"
"It's a good software to learn some basic piano skills. However are few issues I've noticed and would like to see addressed: 1) The MIC recording is always on, even if USB MIDI interface is used. 2) Most video tutorials are available only in English. 3) No support for BLE MIDI protocol. 4) Inconsistent UI experience. Have to select new user twice every time I switch users."
The apps great and is great for beginners. but one thing i would suggest is an option to disable finger numbers because in the long run it isn't going to help
"Although this app does teach placement and note reading, it does not truly catch the sound of your piano. Any key can be pressed during practice and the notes in the app will light up. It's a 4 start game since it does teach how to read music, but it would be a 5star if it actually could sync better with the notes on my piano. And yes I did tune my piano with the app before playing. Yes my volume was up loud enough for the app and my neighbors to hear."
I think this piano learning app is very wonderful and great and the ways I learned piano notes is very heart-warming and smooth and I wonder if I could play any song on my piano keyboard with this app
"a great way to learn all aspects of piano in an easy to follow manner. however, practice consistently."
It's alright. It teaches you the notes and the basics while it makes you have to do the practice many times even when you play the right notes. Other than that it's pretty good.
"i tried the free trial. the app is amazing and i learned a lot during that time. My head was dizzy from all the play alongs 😂 i understand that you are working hard on the app, but i cant justify spending that amount of money on it. all the options are too expensive. i will consider it if there is a sale sometime."
Pretty good but you have to do essentials 3 which then allows you to play the songs you want and it will just take too long
"it's honestly a really useful app, it helped me learn some piano and sheet music and I never thought I'd learn sheet music, would recommend if you're new to piano"
"It's very useful for learning,except sometimes the speaker fails todetect quickly the note you play,otherwise it's great."
I recommend this app for those who would love to play the piano but I think there is a bug I only pressed 1 key and then it put that I pressed two I hope you know what I mean and can fix this bug thank you
The app is great in helping u learn but it says u have to do a 7 day trial and then start paying which is quite annoying. It is such a great app to get u ready for playing for real
"i think it would be really helpful if the touch screen piano is also available in other courses, it really helps to those who cannot afford a piano or a keyboard to practice."
Star ratings are not appearing in the library so it's impossible to track which songs I've finished and how I've done.
Sometimes It ticks all the notes even when I haven't done anything yet and keeps marking me wrong when I haven't even touched my keyboard other than that amazing please fix this.
I think this is a amazing app however it doesn't always hear you when you play which can be annoying but if you stick with it it's a amazing app.
"still in beginning. 50 yrs old, never read music before. i can't speak as to how good,I've learned 3 notes so far(poorly)"
"the song covers they use to teach you songs are SO bad, I have to turn my volume down. Sometimes the mic on my phone is either too sensitive or not sensitive enough so it can be a little funky but besides this the app isn't too bad"
"Personally, I am a complete beginner! I have learnt so much already however my only complaint in you can only do so much learning and then you have to pay but on the other hand you can still do daily workout as many times you want 🎹 . If your like me, you will enjoy this app and soon will happily pay premium like I'm about to. It is definitely more pros then cons and I would recommend it 👌"
"So far so good! Question though, can it work with a BCP teaching piano? I can't figure out how to integrate the tablet and APP with my 6yo's BCP Teaching Piano. It's one of the standalone keyboards that has light-up keys. It's a 61-key model. She loves playing it and the APP is wonderful so far. Please let me know if there is away to use the light-up function with the app. Thanks!"
"This app makes learning piano, easy and fun! It's super addictive. My one critique is that they can do more to celebrate your progress, like maybe keep track of hours you've been learning, or celebrate achievements in your learning progress!"
"I've been using the app for a week and it's quite nice, but it would really help if I could scroll through the song to get to the parts I need to practice. I keep having to restart the song and end up learning the intro well and doing miserably at the rest of the song. The metronome doesn't help me learn the song at the speed it needs to be played. Being able to scroll would really do the trick."
Love it. Use it regularly and beginner friendly features such as various courses and 5 min workouts make learning the piano so readily accessible especially in the current cost of living crisis. Would recommend to anyone.
I have not paid for anything in the app so my review is invalid. Better than yousician for basic learning of sheet music in my opinion.
I would like to try a free trial but it's does not work and when I try to pay I swipe with my 2 fingers and doesn't work also so I need your help
"While I highly recommend taking genuine piano lessons, this is a great app for anyone who doesn't have the extra time or money for that."
Sometimes the notes played are not correctly identified. I enjoy working with the musical accommpanied.
it's really good I just learn piano in 3 to 4 days it's really easy to learn piano you can play songs easily but you need a little practice because some of the songs are really fast and you can't play the notes quickly so the hand movement is much more needed but overall the app is really good to learn piano
"Great app with a wide & diverse selection. The devs actually listen and help when they can. The basics of the app are good but some of the ergonomics are wonky. Like moving songs around in your playlist is done by sliding the song up/down, but it gets stuck and lags once you reach the edge of the screen. The Deezer Connect feature has promise, but is incredibly glitchy and unusable. Playing songs also don't sync from phone to PC. Small quirks but overall great app. Never going back to Spotify."
Deezer is the best all-round music streaming service widely available. You can think of it as a hybrid of qobuz’s sound quality and spotifys ease of use. Only reason I took of a star is because the app crashed on me and I had to redownload my songs. Otherwise this is the best ALL-ROUND music streaming service that will satisfy anyone except the most hardcore audiophile.
"Overall, it is a great app to listen to music or podcasts but, lacks fluidity and some features. It takes a while to load on their higher quality audio. High fidelity with the worst load time of about 10 seconds when you are just getting started. Other sound apps with a bluetooth device with a single tap of ""play""the applications would play audio but not with Deezer. Like I said before, a great option to listen to high-quality music. However, it is not the greatest option but one of the cheaper."
"Overall this a good music app, most of all artists are here but with a few missing. Love that it's lossless and love that there's a good desktop app for windows and Linux. Although there are a few complaints I have about Deezer. I would love if I could shuffle play the songs in an album and shuffle play all the songs from an artist. Also I've noticed that some smaller artists like Creo are mixed with songs from other artists. Other than that, this is a good service."
"Great music app but some features don't work. On mobile some songs would skip some seconds im not sure if its my connection when trying to stream HiFi, also when I try to use Deezer connect to control songs on my pc it just dosen't work at all I hope it gets fixed on a future update. But otherwise I love the selection of songs and it seems to be better at recommending songs than spotify was. Keep it up Deezer!"
"Great app, works as intended and has a lot of nice features. My main gripe is that it takes a bit too long too load, mainly when you want to use it offline. However it only happens when you open it initially, it works smoothly afterwards. The other is that the music selection for Anime soundtracks or Japanese artists in general feels lacking, I have to upload the tracks myself to have a complete playlist."
"I was a Google Music user until they destroyed a good thing and rebranded to YouTube music. Deezer is much closer to meeting my needs. There are a few infuriating quirks, mainly the frequency of repeated songs and artists in any algorithm created mix. Shuffle is not random but follows the same pattern every time. There are random crashes on mobile and the Roku app was abandoned. Otherwise, I think I've found a tolerable music platform."
"If you're searching for an excellent songs application that supplies an incredible choice of music, then the Deezer music application is the excellent choice for you. With over 90 million tracks offered, you'll never ever lack options. And also, with SongCatcher, you can conveniently identify tracks and also learn their verses. If you're wanting to enter the mood for something, Flow can help you do that. Finally, if you wish to customize your experience, you can use our lyrics translation attrib"
"Generally happy with this app. Deezer is my go-to music player. I like the way it handles my private song collection, allowing the songs to easily be added to playlists. However, I'm very disappointed that the app does not play directly on Echo or Sonos speakers. The Sonos app is an acceptable alternative, but the Echo ""solution"", Alexa Flow, is abysmally bad, totally nonfunctional. It would be great if Deezer's own app would function on Echo and Sonos speakers, as it does on Bluetooth speakers."
"One of the best options for streaming when it comes to sound quality. The AI could be better. It's hard to compete with Spotify and Apple Music in that area though, so I can't hold it against them too much. I tend to use Spotify to find music and Deezer to play my favorites just because it sounds better on Deezer and Spotify is better at knowing what I might like to check out. I recommend this as a convenient media option for anyone who appreciates good audio."
"Almost perfect. Flac audio, good UI, offline music, lyrics, etc. Responsiveness could be slightly better, especially with song loading speed. (Takes about 2-3 seconds to load a song it wasnt prepared for, like selecting a random song.) The app also feels heavy, again mostly do to responsiveness. It also isnt great on battery. Most of their competitors have battery drain and bloat issues though. Lastly their web player is super laggy. In the end its still very good and the best option out there."
"The app looks and feels good to use. The suggested playlists are great. This is close to a 5/5. However I can't edit the now playing list while casing to my Google home. It doesn't let me rearrange or swipe songs out of now playing, making it a real pain to use while casting (which constitutes about 30% of my use). A shame because otherwise the app and service is great and has improved immensely from when I tried it years ago. As of right now I'm not sure of I'll keep my subscription."
"The app is pretty nice. The UI isn't confusing, I can search for Tracks, Playlists and Artists. It's just the website and the app for PC's flawed. I log in with my account on my pc, start playing my favourite tracks, then it doesn't go to the next song once it's done with the first. When I try to select the next song manually, it plays the first song again."
"After several weeks of usage... Superior than every other app I've tried. Easy to find artists, songs and albums. Seems to have every song ever produced, and I've a bizarrely wide taste in music. Clean logical layout to the app. I can actually find what I've listened to in the past. The SOUND, even with the basic plan, is obviously better than most others. It can even access the equalizer on my phone unlike most others. Deducted a star since there's no way to listen on a smart TV. 😒"
"It's a shame I can't change this over to my main audio streaming app. I really love the app design. I love how there's both a light and dark mode. The layout is simplistic and you can find things easy. Also the HiFi Audio Quality of songs is just as good or better than any other app too. However I pay for Google Music which also includes no YouTube ads, so I don't want to give that up. Also the podcast library here isn't as much as Spotify. Maybe 1 day when I can afford to pay 2 audio apps."
"I've grown to love deezer so much I probs won't stop using it even if I leave Ghana. First, it's great that they're in Africa. And then they have the karaoke feature and the song search feature? Ugh. It's like Spotify but extra (except maybe Spotify upgraded now? It's been a bit since I got off it). I also like that their interface is white, Spotify's was a little too dark for me. The one thing I don't like is artist pages get mixed up and finding albums can be quite frustrating. BUT GET IT."
"Great music service that really works for me except the 2,000-album limit. I love collecting and shuffling and that's hugely disappointing. The app was buggy for me, but I don't think it had all the permissions it needed, so I may have fixed it. TuneMyMusic is a great web-app service for transferring playlists from one music service to another. Discovery features are pretty good. If it weren't for the album limit, it would be the best music streaming service I've tried. I hope they remove that."
"The past few weeks I've been getting an error about my account listening from another device - I know for a fact that there's no other device using the service. I can dismiss this and it can play flawlessly for an hour, but eventually I'll get the same notification. Sometimes it's only a few seconds. I've reset my phone and double checked my pc to ensure its not running elsewhere. Really frustrating for a service that's $15 a month... UPDATE - Customer Service has been easy to work with. Would be nice to have a feature to see which devices are linked to your account, with the ability to deactivate. It seems that's what they've done. I will update again if there are still issues."
"I made a transition from Tidal to Deezer because Deezer does support voice command via the Assistant, I love the fact that I can actually play high fidelity music without requiring a computer and another plus is the ability to listen to radio. The downside is the menu it is not as easy as other services but im sure i just have to get used to it. The biggest flaw in my experience is that when I use the assistant to request a song, it plays the song but in another version either live or a remix, it has happened way too many times while i just want to listen to the original regular studio version that i would expect, even more if said song is widely known and popular in its original version not a remix."
"I am suddenly a little confused. I get that the app will slip in a song it thinks you might like. That's fine. My favorites I have selected are metal, hard rock, classic rock, and a bit of progressive rock. Suddenly today it thinks I like rap and doesn't play anything from my favorites. At first it was a bit startling. Now it is just frustrating. What gives? ETA: Opened the app this morning, all seemed well. Maybe just a glitch in the matrix? LOL. Thank you Deezer for responding."
"totally amazing! wayy better than 'other' music-listening apps. it literally let's you think of a song, search it AND play it right there. it's that easy. even with the standard ""no-subscription' type, there isnt 10 artist messages or automatically changing back to a sponsored playlist you never chose to play in the first place. i love it and reccomend, although I only gave it 4 stars and not the full 5 stars, ONLY because the subsvriltuin prices are a little high."
"Seems like the app would flow better and look more unifored, having a my library, my artists, or my music button at the bottom. The favorites button seems odd and unfinished when you get to your favs. Instead of a list of words it seems like the artists, albums, and playlists should be shown with graphics right after pushing favorites instead of just words. The rest of the app is great but the user gets a fav. list that looks odd with an extra pointless step."
"Let me port over all my music from spotify with tune my music for free! The app does have lag issues while music plays if you're trying to navigate other places/select a different song it takes a few seconds to respond. Most frustrating for me tho is when you're editing a playlist and moving new songs around, once you've scrolled away and cant see the new song in the new order, it looks like it resets(if you save it's in the place you put it) which can be confusing Otherwise great!"
"Almost perfect music service, from diverse selection to accurate identification using the auto search. Only slight issues with app usability. Biggest problem I've run in to is while using Android Auto, the app won't auto play the next song. Meaning it'll advance to the next song, but it'll pause so sometimes you have to hit play again after one song ends. Only had this issue on Android Auto so maybe it's an Android Auto issue and not a Deezer issue."
"I like the minimal and clean interface, with organization that actually makes sense. It's also much faster on my phone than another ubiquitous green music streaming service I used to use. High Quality sounds great! It's not without bugs however, and I really wish it had an option for gapless playback between consecutive tracks in an album."
"The stations created by songs could be better, they repeat songs way too quickly, but... The Shuffle feature for your favorites list seems to work very well, which is why I left one of their major competitors. Also, I LOVE that they have the ""SongCatcher"" feature built into their app!! This is something I was wanting before from my previous service! Way to go, Deezer!!"
"Long time Spotify user, however their app has been basically useless for me lately, so I came to Deezer. I love the 'play next' feature, and the hi fi sound and the ability to transfer my playlists but I miss the GIFs that play during some songs and also I like the pre-made playlists better on Spotify. overall it's a decent replacement and I think given some time I'll forget all about the other app and I'll come to appreciate it more."
Fantastic audio quality. Massive selection of HIFI lossless. Sounds amazing on my open back planar magnetic headphones. Their motion towards a user centric payment system is what brought me in. I hope they can bring it to the US. So I'm here supporting that as well. Coming from Spotify it should be noted that the user interface could use some streamlining.The podcast selection is limited and I can't get about half of the podcasts I would normally subscribe to. Those are my complaints.
For the most part I love Deezer but it irritates me that you can't shuffle individual playlists. There's no button on mobile. It's either shuffle all the songs in your song library or listen to the playlist in order every time. Edit: so it seems on mobile the issue only happens when you're casting to a device. Which is still a bit annoying bue not as bad as it could be.
Overall decent. Good sound quality. Just not quite as extensive of a music library as other major streaming services. But i do like that deezer provides a better variety of music based on what i like. Other streaming services tend to create very repetitive/redundant playlists. Also the release dates under artists discography can be inaccurate at times but other than that the app gets the job done.
"Overall great experience, a big library of music and the user interface has become more intuitive in the latest updates. Love the playlist creation, some of the recommendations and Flow, and the ""recently played"". Also love the Songcatcher feature. My only issues with the app are that sometimes albums don't display the date in which they were originally released, but the date in which they were added; and the ""Loved"" playlist bugs sometimes when changing the order of the songs. Cheers!"
"I have been using deezer off and on for about 3 years and I enjoy it most of the time. My only issues is that sometimes the songs crash while loading and my shuffle mix seems like it consists of the same songs every time. Overall though, they have a great selection of music to choose from and I like the service."
"I've been looking for a decent music streaming app that would fit my needs as I wasn't happy with Spotify and Deezer has filled that gap for now. If I could download the tracks independently, that would be great. Also, some key Led Zeppelin albums are not here which seems weird but I can live with that. Enjoy the experience on Windows 10 app as well, not as janky as other alternatives."
I have had problems with the app. since the new update most problems have been fixed. But i still have an issue with the widet. Annoying but i do still enjoy the music that they have to offer. But there are still a lot of bands that i would like for them to offer that they dont have. Mostly please fix your widget.
Very good. Started with a free trial but I stayed cause deezer works really well I'm happy I got it. Do have one issue though. I wish there was an option to always play explicit songs cause sometimes I'll listen to a good song and they blur out everything then I need to look up the explicit version which sounds more frustrating then having an explicit and not explicit mode
"I love that all the newest tracks and artists are the focus and always on the forefront of the app any and every time I open it. I'm not super excited that I have the option to mark my favorites and even make a personalized playlist that I can't fully utilize without having to upgrade and buy the PREMIUM version. It's all good now though, I payed for the subscription and can now download and listen offline and play my tracks in any order that I like as opposed to before. It's worth purchasing"
"PLEASE fix the skipping issue with Deezer on Sonos!!! Many people have complained about this for a LONGGGGGG time & nothing has been done! There is no reason I shouldn't be able to skip through however many songs, however many times I WANT!!! If I skip through 3 songs on shuffle trying to find a song, it kicks me out for over an hour where I am unable to use it on Sonos! Please fix this!!! This is the only reason I am not giving 5 stars!"
"The genres and selections are great. Love the fact that it's user friendly and is easy on my battery. App shuts down randomly between songs throughout the day...even mid song. When it works, it's amazing. Unfortunately for $9.99 it's not worth the hassle and might be going elsewhere."
"This app is great and all but its super annoying because half the time it wont even play music, it'll just say loading, couple more seconds, and ill wait minutes and it still wont play. I cant even listen to music and this is an app literally meant for that, so please help me, this is the last day on my free premium trail and I really dont wanna waste it, so please help me so I can actually listen to music. There's no point in buying premium if I cant listen to music. Please help me."
"**Hey Deezer**, I was premium but didn't care for the limit on one's library. I recently noticed that you have a lot of actual ""Radio Stations"" available that I like. But as it is now I can't favorite and save a list of them. If I could, WITHOUT A LIMIT, I'd come back as a PREMIUM SUBSCRIBER, and cancel my Soundcloud subscription! Personally, through collage.orgs, listener supported.coms and independent freeform .orgs, is where I discover most my music. (Soma,kexp,wfmu,wwoz, wcyt,wumb,kxlu)!"
Great selection of LITERALLY anything! The only thing I have found that I do not like is....you can't do anything with your personal account like cancel subscription or even find anything to do with your account. Otherwise the selection available on the paid app is off the chains and always keeps things mixed up. Doesn't repeatedly play the same songs
"Its a really good app. I find most of my music here and the quality is great. The experience is also exceptional. And also I love how my music is synchronized across all my devices. It doesn't have the fade in, fade out feature on android though. Work on that Deezer"
"Update 9.25.22: works well enough. music files are great. the detail. guess the tide adds some information that wasn't there to begin with. Deezer just plays (hopefully) cd quality. the ""flow"" station and other stations are questionable...use Pandabox to find your music and use Deezer to play it. Pandabox has such a good algorithm compared to Deezer. it works but...it's also very questionable sometimes...it seems to have an import feature now. import your likes and make your playlists..."
"I have had a great experience with Deezer. Great choice of music, great prices and no downloading problems. I have been a subscriber for about (3) yrs and the one time my payment didn't post on time, they terminated my membership. When I try to become a member again it won't let me because it says that my email is already in use. Which I know isn't true because I can't access any of my songs. I'm scared to register with another email and CC because what happens if I start getting double billed?"
"The app is wonderful! Theres only one problem I have encountered after using the app for awhile. Whenever I turn off my phone and the song would suddenly static a bit, go back to normal, than would just stop but when I turn my phone on the song continues to play. So playing issues is all i have to say otherwise it is perfect"
"If you're looking for a solid alternative to Spotify as far as app usage goes then Deezer may or may not be for you. The app itself is designed alright, but what really sold me to switch to Deezer over Amazon Music ultra HD and Spotify was the quality of music you get on Deezer compared to others. The app needs to save that you want your playlist to shuffle rather than having to click shuffle every time you listen to that playlist!! And make an app for Samsung watches don't let Spotify win here!"
"After trying, and paying premium for several of the popular, as well as another half dozen or more of the lesser known apps and players, I've decided to go with deezer. Great sound quality and it never drops or closes my prefered Eq. mod. Extremely good selection, including many artists that the others just dont offer. There are areas that could be improved upon, but they are consistant, and for my premium $, I'm going to stay with deezer. One suggestion to deezer: offer MAQ titles."
"switched from Spotify due to the better sound quality. i like to go camping out of the service area so downloading is very important. I'm having trouble with the downloads. they won't play, or won't download altogether. i Also liked the creative playlists on Spotify. great way to hear new music. Deezer has some pretty good playlists but I find more opportunities to learn about new artists on Spotify. other than those couple of things, Deezer would be 5 stars in my opinion."
"Very nice application but ut has some few things to get right. Like confusing small artists with other if they have the same name and sometimes weird recommendations for similar music, also the player seems to crash if the network changes and is unstable (not sure what exactly is the issue, but data + unstable wifi causes the player to crash and asks for a retry or cancel). Suggested mixes and quality is great though so 4 stars fits 👌"
"Good selection, high fidelity, reasonable price. Needs some usability improvements, including more options for playlist creation like customisable weightings (i.e. Favourites would weigh heavily), as well as possibly a ""like"" button alongside the ""favourite"" one. Lastly, please make it easier to download without favouriting and vice versa. 🙏"
"Overall a very good music streaming service. I do find the ""flow"" streams tend to repeat themselves a lot. Otherwise I've been using the service for over 5 years and find it a lot more intuitive than other providers."
"It was a breathe of fresh air after leaving amazon music. App has better UI, hifi, better download system, etc. Only thing that's annoying is, it is really hard to force close the app. Song is keep playing even if I close the app window so I have to use force close option in phone settings."
"Good selection of songs, but the mixes or radios that are aupposed to base off a particular song are just waaay off. If you start with a classical song you'l get anything from rap to country and everything in between. Yikes."
"As you can see my ratings, i like the app. During the 30days trial i was excited and i had what i like, during Christmas it was a party. Due to some reasons i had to cancel with it. My cancellation was ignored, I'm still getting messages to come back and the subscription fee is still being taken yet i do not use the app any more."
"Great, except for when I want to delete a track from the playlist, it used to be fine until annupdate but now when I delete a track from the queue it decides to make me wait until the message saying that ""it deleted the track, do I want to undo"" disappears, then takes me back to the currently playing song very frustrating, please fix."
"Overall hands down, I'm loving this app & the fact that I can adjust the equalizer to my own liking ❤️ big YAAAAAS! 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons: 1.) Because I don't know if the music I add to my ""favorites"" isn't downloading to my cell phone, and honestly I'm not even sure if this app offers that advantage or not. 2.) & If you don't subscribe or get the ""30 day free trial"" then the app won't let you listen to your music you've saved unless you are on & using the app."
This app is good and is a competition of Spotify and I am new user of it. The reason I am giving this app 4 stars is that I can't go back to the song when I start playing my playlist and it again and again starts asking me for premium so please do something about it.
I did a trial with all the top streaming services and found this to sound the best. The library doesn't disappoint. The mix does pull in some new music I enjoy. Disappointed to not see this on Roku or Samsung TV as an option for living room.
"I have been a premium user for about 6 months now . My biggest complaint is that it is to conservative on resources , and this causes problems with anything that requires the app to do some digging and think . My phone is stronger than some laptops , it isn't a computing bottleneck . If they would make the app be able to think , and not make me nudge it for every album I want it to download , I would give it 5 stars ."
"Premium version works great, especially find the song playing around feature. But sometimes it won't let me select another song to play, I need to add it to queue and press next button in order to play it."
"some UI issues stopping me from downloading podcasts, individual songs, and generated playlists. Otherwise good. I like the ability to import favorite artists from other services."
"Okay, why is discography missing in the artist page now? I can still find the albums on search but they are no longer showing under a lot of artists. Edit:: I'm chatting with devs via email now. Gave some stars back since y'all responded fairly quick! Still working on a fix."
"I wish they had an option to make songs play next, or add songs to the queue when in radio. But otherwise the app is good and the sound quality is unparalleled."
"Just subscribed and I'm loving my experience, so far. There's just one thing not working properly: the Just Heard playlist. When I listen to full albums, not even half of the songs appear in the listening history. I'm wondering if the playlist is bugged or Deezer is not counting right the reproduced songs."
Overall a very good app that supports higher we quality playback than other services - flow used to a bit random but the algorithm seems to have learned my listening style now. A couple of niggles though: sometimes I'll need to manually tell the app to go offline to load my favourites when I don't have internet access even though I'm only expecting to access what I already have downloaded; it'd be nice to have more control over the queue; and a more fully featured wearable app
"All of these music apps are about the same price, I currently ugly have the family plan. I can no tell you to choose the bed one because their all pretty Much the sa!e its all about what your choice is. personally I like Amazon music unlimited, or spiritual free (after I laid for it and chose all the songs I like) Deeper is my third favorite but I paid an extra month accidentally so i. using it now lol"
"Great sound quality, app crashes quite a few times which ruins the experience, auto download is really slow I would like it if the music would download as soon as you heart the music or connect to wifi"
Worth every penny paying for HiFi but I wish the app made it easier to discover new music. A lot of my recommendations 70% of the time are irrelveant to whatever I'm listening to.
"Has the best music options of all genres, so far the best music app I've had for me personally. It's like Spotify, I got premium for this app and it's been very awesome, it's easy to find new music and keep adding to your jams. Very simple app and I love it a lot!! It's worth a try and the name is pretty cool :)"
"Everything is perfect, only thing to improve would be the cross platform support and fix the crashes."
"works very well for the most part. like 95% of the time. sound is great, selection of music is fantastic. but the 5% errors out the whole app. have to fully close and really open. not the biggest issue but can be annoying."
Usually 5☆ but this morning I can't seem to access all my favourites. It looks like they have disappeared from my profile. In fact I couldn't even access my subscription account without a password change. What is happening?
Expensive!!! and it shuts down. But I like the HIFI quality and the ease of pulling down and sliding up the now playing screen.
"I definitely love the Deezer music app! It has a lot of great functions and the interface is actually simple to utilize. I love the SongCatcher function which helps me conveniently determine tracks. I additionally really value the Verses and Translation attributes, that makes it so simple to delight in songs whatever language I'm attempting to pay attention to. And also the Circulation function is truly handy in helping me discover the ideal songs for the right mood. Generally, I very advise the"
"Deezer is a fantastic songs application! With over 90 million tracks, you're sure to find something you like. You can additionally utilize SongCatcher to easily recognize tracks and also discover verses. Ultimately, Circulation lets you select your state of mind and also receive individualized suggestions."
It can be more easier to use like Spotify... Deezer has bad user interface on my opinion.
Missing some music. Occasionally doesn't appear on android auto and then I have to reconnect my phone while driving
"in favorite songs list when you are for example in the middle of the list, if you turn the screen off, you will find yourself at the beginning of the list. And could you please add information about albums like the year it was released? It would be very helpful. PLEASE, FIX IT and i will rate it as 5."
"4 out of five because when I try to search a song,80 percent of the time it will say : no items to display and it is really frustrating. But otherwise it is an excellent music app👌"
"Removing discography section on the artist page was really bad idea. Upd: discography is available for some of the artists and is missing for others. Upd2: resolved, kudos to support team"
"This app keeps pausing my songs, am not in a call am not texting but it will jus stop playing. Please rectify this because the increase in subscription should match the end product"
"If you enjoy music, the Deezer music application is the ideal application for you! With over 90 million tracks, you can check out any kind of style or state of mind you want. You can likewise utilize our SongCatcher attribute to recognize tracks, and our verses translation attribute makes it easy to sing along. As well as if you want to get back at much more out of your music experience, utilize our Flow attribute to individualize your suggestions and also pick your state of mind filter. So whet"
My favorite music streaming app out of them all though I do wish they had gapless playback for album songs. That's the only thing holding this app back from 5 stars. Other than that this app is amazing and has more features and is desktop friendly for pc and obviously on mobile devices.
"It's an ok streaming service. The audio quality is good and there is an excellent selection of music, the only issue I have is that the ""Flow"" random selection of new and favourite tracks consistently plays the same tracks."
"i really like it!! it's just as good, if not better than Spotify, essentially after the whole podcast thing that happened. I do wish that there where more small artist songs. I noticed that alot of very small artiste just aren't on Deezer. othe that I love it"
Occasionally the app stops randomly during music playback in the background but is still more consistent than my experiences with Spotify over many years. I very much love the ability to setup a cache size as lossless take up a lot of storage.
"ok alternative to Spotify, HD streaming is a nice bonus since I have somewhat ok cans and amp. would be nice to have global playback Control like in Spotify, even as just a hidden option. A lap navigating podcast episode feels clunky, but i cant pot my finger on the reason."
Love the sound quality...but got signed out of my premium account on my new phone and was unable to get back in. Just cancelled and will probably come back when premium runs out with current payment. Easier to get back into bank accounts.....
"An awesome music service, with the best curated playlists I've found on any platform. There's a weird bug though where you can't play you're liked songs offline which happens on both ios and android."
Please fix the sorting the playlists out! Everytime I'm moving them it's going back to where it was which is really annoying! Also when editing the playlist I have to scroll it up 5 stops in stead of automatically going up as I push the song up
"It's really quite good. It seems to really like to remakes of songs. Maybe it's google, but I find I need to specifically grab my phone and put on the original versions a lot."
"very good App, but I dont like it sometimes when it takes way too long to open my playlists"
"Somos songs refuse to download. I'm reinstalling the app to see of that fixes it. Great audio quality compared to Spotify though, I wish the user experience was just as good."
Music quality is superb. I just wish I had the option to extract other apps's playlist to this one. Also hope I can install it on my LG TV but couldn't probably the issue is on the LG itself.
EDIT: Seems to work only whem both devices are connected to the same network. (The new feature that's supposed to allow remote playback control won't work)
Thanks for finally fixing the payment issue that the systems were having; sucks that I had to create a whole new account. Especially after having that one from the original Muve Music account via CricKet years ago. But thanks for giving me my Deezer back after MONTHS of withdrawal. Happy Holidays. 🎄
Best music app. I just think the price per month is kind of high 😔
"Best of the music streaming apps, but a bit glitchy on the android auto."
I absolutely like LowerMyRx! I have actually been utilizing it for a few years now and also it has never ever let me down. I always find the lowest discounted rate for my prescription drug at pharmacies near me and also across the country. I also use the voucher codes as well as price cuts they offer. It has actually conserved me a lots of money. I extremely suggest this app to any individual that is searching for a fantastic way to reduce their prescription drug!
"App is slow. Lots of loading. Please fix. Aside front that issue, I like the app. The interface in nice. Looks better than Spotify. Please fix the loading issue."
"PLEASE add a feature that allows me to selective multiple songs so I can add some songs from one playlist to another, or at least make it easier to search/find my own playlists when adding to a playlist! My music taste is very broad and somewhat random, so most of my songs fit into several different playlists. Other than that, I love Spotify. Perhaps the fact that I use the app literally every day and listen to so much music on it is the reason this minor frustration comes up so often for me."
"My biggest issue is the fact it has serious problems streaming with my chromecast. Not connecting at all about 80% of the time, inability to control what's playing when it does connect anywhere from 70 to 90% of the time, and randomly disconnecting itself at least 80% of each connected session. Also, the UI is honestly not intuitive at all, and it took me an embarrassingly long time to find new releases of my favorite artists, which is a small icon that draws no visual attention"
"I've been using this app for 6 years now. Overall, it's great creates Playlists based on what I listen to and very easy to use. My only complaint was that I tried to upgrade to the couples 5 my partner was supposed to get premium with no adds. We followed all the steps, and it worked for a week, but then his plan was downgraded with ads and couldn't search music. I still paid for the couples plan and tried fixing it several times. Nothing ever resolved, so I downgraded to the single premium."
"So far so good but a couple things. When adding songs to a Playlist, they need to move the ""hide song"" option. I keep accidentally tapping on that option when trying to ""add song to Playlist"". Also when I'm listing to an album, when I move to a different app and come back to the Spotify app, it always takes me back to the search screen rather than staying on the album. It's annoying to have to re-search the album when I move to a different album."
"I really like this app. Great features, you can play pretty much whatever you want whenever you want, but I'm going to be honest, I would pay more for it if it was better. I want it to shuffle my queue, organize songs in groups for me, suggest playlists, DJ my music, listen to the songs I sing and what friends listen to, I want it to have that adaptive connection with my life like what Google has with its ad system that no one ever asked for. Make it for Spotify, then it's 5 stars all the way."
"It's a good app. I like most of the features, except from time to time, the app freezes when editing a playlist and doesn't save my work. I also would like to suggest- like the playlist feature, where you can add all of the songs in one click- I would prefer a podcast-playlist feature like that, as well."
"Edit: they changed it back! Original: Honestly Spotify is/was the most polished and feature rich of all the music services, though the gap has narrowed considerably in the last year (seriously it's been 2 years, where is HiFi??). But this new UI is the absolute worst. I *DO NOT* want you to autoplay suggested podcasts and playlists like it's TikTok at max volume. At least let me disable it like I can for the equally annoying ""canvas"". Unsubscribed until they fix it, but they probably won't."
"Edit: they reverted the UI!! Huzzah! 1->4 stars. I've used Spotify Premium since 2013. It's been a wonderful experience, however if you don't have premium the experience is incredibly subpar on app. Spotify wrapped is pretty cool. Occasionally artists leave the platform and their music becomes unavailable, would love to be notified when that happens. Primarily use desktop, but the app is great for downloading playlists and podcasts for road trips."
"EDIT: They have gotten rid of the UI change (for now). Horrible, awful home UI. Literally unusable. Autoplays completely random songs at maximum volume. Layout is formatted in a very, very stupid way making it impossible to browse and see more than a single song(that will autoplay at max volume) at a time. If you have the misfortune to come across this ""facelift,"" do yourself a favor and find a better app."
"App will just stop playing music. Shows one song but will be actually playing a different song. Podcasts are hit or miss when looking for them let alone listening to them. App messes up daily and I'm constantly Uninstalling and reinstalling this app to ""fix"" it before it messes up again a few hours later. I'd find a different app but my library is so huge on this one that I don't want to remake a new one on a different platform. I've had Spotify Premium for years but the issues are getting worse"
The only reason I can't give it a full 5 starts is the playing issue. Sometimes it will randomly pause the music or while playing a Playlist it will end a song as soon as 1 min. in and just straight to the next song or even 2 songs ahead for no reason 🤔 if this can be fixed I'll update my rating. It's hard to pinpoint the way to reach tech support or customer service as well.
"My app updated to the version with large cards and automatically playing videos, which I absolutely hated. Thankfully, after a couple weeks, it has reverted to its previous version which loads better, is easier on the eyes, and actually shows me stuff I want to listen to. Fingers crossed it stays this way."
This new ui update is awful. Just awful. Music listeners don't need a scrolling feed to find music. It actually makes it harder. Now I can't find my daily mixes or Playlists. I am considering switching music services if this is not resolved. I have used Spotify for years and had no issues. Please fix this. EDIT: It has since been fixed and now raising review
"4/27/23 Update! Still hanging on and doing fine EXCEPT THIS ONE THING! About once every two weeks or so, my custom playlists will get stuck on shuffle. The only way to get them unstuck is to log out, uninstall, reinstall and log back in. It's quite annoying. It would be a lot easier if we had the option to stop shuffle for podcasts like we have with music and music playlists. OG post 5/20 I am enjoying this app fully!"
"I tried YouTube Music when Google murdered Play Music and it was awful. Spotify works pretty well and has a fair amount of content. Its autogenerated playlists have some self-update issues that can usually be worked around with enough fiddling, and the UI has some design choices around demanding you use Bluetooth audio devices or try to use something like a Chromecast that I wish I could disable. Beyond those inconveniences it's been a fairly solid music service."
"It's a really good app and it has lots of famous and really good songs but the reason I'm giving it a 4 star rating is because it plays random songs in between my Playlist and its really annoying, my friend also has the same problem. It would be nice if you could fix this spotify, some of us don't have premium Spotify so it is kinda annoying to have to listen to random songs not in your playlist."
"Liking the fact I can like the songs I listen to, but it's starting to annoy me when it begins to play ""suggested"" songs as if they are in my liked. If I wanted to listen to those songs I WOULD have them liked. But they aren't in my liked playlist, and would rather not hear them. With OR without premium. I'm not paying for something when I shouldn't have to. Even if I have to sit through 3 to 4 ads after 3 songs. I don't want to hear SUGGESTED songs, thank you! Change it or my review changes!"
"The most recent update to Spotify (5/1/2023) on my laptop (windows 11) completely changed the layout of the entire app, which is not on disorientating but also completely useless. My biggest complaint is that the option to personally customize the order in which I organize the playlist themselves is completely gone. Before this update, I had my playlists sorted in a specific way and now its completely ruined. I will make my review higher when this is fixed."
"This latest version (8.8.20.544) is a huge step back. My daily mixes are gone and replaced by these full screen playlists that makes smooth scrolling and finding stuff very difficult. On top of that, I'm now getting music that I have zero interest in hearing being played no matter how many times I pick 'Not interested' or 'Exclude from taste profile'."
"Okay so I love spotify, I've used it for I believe 2 to 3 years consistently now, but here recently I have noticed something that actually irritates me to no end because I have done multiple things to fix this issue. When I try and sort my likes list into songs by genre it literally will not show me ANY songs even if I have them claiming I have some sort of ""filter"" on and last I checked I never added any other than to sort by the genre. It's extremely irritating and I hope this can be fixed."
"I love Spotify so much. I've been using it for years, but something weird has been happening. When I select songs in my playlist that I've recently added, it doesn't play. Like, it just skips over every song and just goes straight to the song suggestions. This is really annoying. Can you guys please fix this? I added some songs to my playlists that I really want to listen to, but I can't because of this problem."
"Once I started giving feedback on songs or artists I loved, it worked brilliantly. I get tons of new music I love every week. The reason there's only 4 stars is because if I don't like a podcast, I can't remove it from what I want to hear. I've had to change playback settings to only play one so that it doesn't play podcasts I don't like."
I love Spotify! The reason I didn't give you a 5 star rating is because there's one simple flaw that's really annoying. When scrolling through a playlist if I accidentally touch the heart on a liked song it'll remove it from my liked playlist without verifying that I wanted to remove it. There's a lot of songs that I like the first time I hear them and I won't even know the name of the song/artist. Give collaborative playlists more exposure. They're awesome but most ppl don't know about em
"A lot of great features that help me discover new music and play what I already like. My main issue is not being able to stop the app from running easily - it always has the last song, podcast episode, etc. active, and it plays automatically when I connect my phone to my car's audio. Otherwise, it works well."
I wish they would stop changing stuff thats not broken and fix the real problems! Idk why my search history deletes itself and its very annoying. They can do a better job on shuffling playlist and songs seeing that play the same songs that I already know everyday. Better than the other platforms but at least they introduce the listeners to new song or song you may like.
"Most importantly: Spotify gives directly to the artist without taxing them or the donar. The only reason I knocked a star of is because of this continuing thing where you can't download single songs unless in a Playlist of some sorts... Other than that, I tried apple music for 8 months but still always come back to Spotify. Lastly, with my data/wifi off or bad service... Seems d/L music rarely loads so I can play it."
"I want to view a songs details: release date and related info and links on the main play page. If there are ways besides switching to Google could you let me know? Favorite media player for years, obviously :p Thanks. Edit: I would like to enlarge album or song images. For screenshots and zooms. I love the simple ease of use/ that thing I can't think how to word."
"It's awesome, really. But on phone it's so limited without premium. Only 6 skips per hour, you can't adjust the place on the song, no going back to a song you just listened to, and you can't chose to repeat the song or if you want to listen on shuffle or in order. On laptop, pc, and chromebook it's the exact opposite though so I guess that is a plus."
"Great... with premium. For a long while, I've been using the free version, which barely functioned correctly. You got ads every other song, you can only skip a few songs a day, and Spotify sometimes auto plays songs you most likely won't like. I did recently get Premium, however, and things definitely improved. Move of these problems exist now, and with downloading music, it's really been useful to me. The only other problem for me is that the music recommendation AI they use is a bit slow."
"I have been using spotify for years on my phone. Its great, it has great sound quality and great features, but one thing is keeping this from 5 stars. After i updated the app 2 days ago so its completely up to date, every time i play a playlist it plays the first song fine, but then instead of playing the second one from the beginning, it starts 30 or so seconds in, and the endings of songs get cut off and fade out and it sounds really weird. This is a huge issue that is utterly annoying."
"I love Spotify. But I really dislike the new update. I enjoyed being able to scroll through the home section and easily access latest podcast episodes. Now, it is an Instagram style scroll of podcasts I have never listened to. They take up the whole screen. It makes looking for relavent new podcasts difficult. The clips of the podcasts start playing right away, which means if I'm browsing in public, I have to panic and mute them. Please give us an option to go back to the old style."
"I always put off rating things, because after doing so you find the problems. I'm new to Spotify, a few months. Actually really love it though. My only complaint is the amount of adds between songs, and how often I'm asked to upgrade. But hell, they have to support and promote themselves. The Playlists are great. The suggestions are great. You can listen to podcasts straight through. You can make tons of lists. It really is a great app.🖤"
"Overall I have used and loved Spotify for years. I tend not to complain about small changes even if it was better before, but the lack of a landscape mode is a huge downside. Even with car mode it won't rotate to landscape! I have no idea why there's no landscape settings as most people use their phones this way in the car. Please fix this."
Been using Spotify for years! Love making my own playlists and listening to podcasts. But I hate the look of the new home page on mobile. Individual things take up too much space now! I also use enhanced playlists and I'd like more ways to mass add songs!! I'd like seeing enhanced songs in the song list. And on the song screen itself if an enhanced song comes up I'd want a Plus button next to the Minus button. And you should be able to sort playlists by Title/Artist/etc even if its enhanced.
"They coined a monopoly on music streaming. Sure, there were other before it, but they got as much popular music as they could and then started getting indie bands, and now they have a pretty impressive library of music. As their empire grew, the free options shrunk until what was considered to be basic (choosing the song you want to listen to) was behind a paywall. This app simply does not function free and can never be considered a good free alternative to streaming music. It's paid only."
"I love spotify, but there are some annoying issues to the app. For example, I want to be able to clear the queue. Also, some times, the app refuses to start playing a song when I've stopped, and I have to skip back to the previous song and then forward again to get it to start. EDIT (3/9/23): It's been almost three years and the issues above have not been fixed."
"I love Spotify. However, there is now a new feature where other users can now comment on random music stations, songs, or podcasts (I'm not sure. it's random). I'm kind of disappointed in that. I DON'T WANT TO ALWAYS SEE OTHER PEOPLES THOUGHTS OR OPINIONS - Leave that to FaceBook. I don't even care that it's positive ""reviews"", or ""feedback"", or whatever the point is, it's just mehh."
"Almost Perfect music streaming. One big problem I have is that if you change the setting to not play songs with explicit content (I have young kids), it doesn't play the clean versions of the songs automatically. If you select one of their preset lists like New Music Friday, it only plays the songs that do not have explicit content, which out of say 20 songs, there are 2 that it will actually play. It should just play the clean versions of the songs in the list so you can hear all of the songs."
"The music keeps pausing every single time my phones screen locks. Kind of frustrating to say the least. Update: This occurs with both my wireless earbuds and wired headphones. Force closing it usually works, but it occurs so often and this last time I did that it didn't work. Update 2: Still not fixed months later. This issue has been constant for at least a 6 months."
"I don't know what other people are saying with the UI being awful, shuffle not working, and having issues finding personal playlists- I have had no issues with these. I have premium and I think it's so worth it. I love the UI, it's so easy for me to find personalized playlists, almost all functions work as they should. The only one I've had an issue with is smart shuffle: that it keeps recommending the same songs. I turn it off and on bec I didn't like the last batch."
"I'm really getting sick of the new Ui that was put in place. I don't even have access to my liked songs anymore without having to go to my library to find it. Another thing that annoys me a little bit is that there are giant boxes of new or recommended playlists and songs/podcasts right below the already recommended stuff that's on there. If you guys can please fix this or make something so you can costumize the homepage yourself or something, that would be awesome."
"Reels is an interesting concept but if you switch apps while in reels and come back and scroll down, the song that was already playing plays over the song you just scrolled to and it does not stop until you completely close out the app. (P.S. My podcast progress doesn't transfer to desktop and it's really annoying trying to find where I left off because it goes the other way and resets where I was on my phone)"
"I usually love Spotify, with premium I can download so many songs and more, and better yet, I don't have ads! I sit on the bus for an hour and listen to all music, all the time. However, my problem is the fact some things don't work so often. Currently, I cannot use the filters in my liked songs. Can somebody please fix this?"
"It's pretty great!! I don't have access to certain songs on here, unfortunately, and sometimes it says I need Wi-Fi for songs I've already downloaded (premium user.) Otherwise, nothing else is really a problem! But I do want to see if we could maybe get a button on our liked songs to turn it into a playlist we can share with friends!"
Sounds like the app heard our complaints and reverted it back- the TikTok cloning did not work. I'm glad I can see many options on my screen now. My music is wide and diverse and my music app should reflect that. I am still upset about how the voice-to-text doesnt work for the search box; I use my Google assistant to do the job the Spotify app refuses to do.
"Latest UI update reduces usefulness. Now I have to scroll through many tiles that take up the whole screen instead of being able to view many options at once. I don't need my music platform to look like tiktok. Edit: they reverted the UI, changed to 4 stars. They still lose A star since there's no way to browse all an artist's songs"
"They fixed the overwhelming size of the albums on the ui, thank you. I've been listening on Spotify since 2016 or so and it has been pretty good. I have over 200,000 hours of listening last year, so the price is reasonable in my opinion due to my use of it. Sometimes a bit buggy, but it usually fixes itself within 2 weeks or so per update"
"A lot of bugs have been fixed and it's improved in performance, but the UI changes recently are very awkward and don't improve upon the previous function. I don't know what the card-based scrolling on the Home screen is meant to be, but it's extremely jarring and doesn't effectively communicate information."
"I absolutely hate the new ""Smart Shuffle"" feature.... I just want to listen to the music that I downloaded sometimes I listen to my music in order and sometimes I like to hit the shuffle button I don't want the other recommended songs. Please just make this a feature that can turned on and off in the settings and not on the player itself."
"The app has improved since my last review. The optimization for old phones is my biggest complaint, but now that I have a better phone, it runs pretty smooth. I will still get errors saying I'm offline when I'm not, and there's features I wish it had; select multiple songs in a playlist, and move playlists into folders."
"This app is really good, it's just that after a while, it eventually tells you you have to listen to other songs even though you search up one song, and it gives you something not even relevant, and it makes you only do a couple skips per hour which is very annoying. Overall very good!!!"
"It's a really good app, but there is one bug where if I restart my phone all my downloads are deleted, and if I reinstall those songs it won't transfer to my SD card because I don't have a lot of storage. So I have to uninstall and reinstall the app do get it to download and transfer my music. But other than that, love it."
"I love this app, it has all my favorite music and I like the video compilations, but there some kind of problem. Whenever I play a playlist, it'll give me an ad and then say I'll get the next 30 minutes without ads. But literally after like the 1st or 2nd song, it'll give me an ad. Please fix this whatever it is."
I think Spotify is still the best streaming service however I have one major complaint with using the app that should be such an obvious thing to the developers. From my home screen if I'm playing a radio station it often doesn't show up at the top of the screen in the app or it takes a while to show up. It only shows the current song at the bottom. Basically for the first ten minutes there is no way for me to go back to the playlist without searching for the radio station in my recents.
"Music selection is awesome! Only issue is with the podcasts. There needs to be a way after listening to a podcast and not liking it Spotify doesn't keep placing new episodes in your que. I've tried unsubscribing and nothing seems to work. They need something like you can do with the song, and either hide the podcast or a setting to remove podcasts. And"
The updated UI just doesn't make sense with music. Autopaying while I am just looking at the selection is horrible. Plus I can't find anything I want because I can only look at things one at a time. I get that people don't like change but this is just straight up harder to find stuff with.
"I personally love spotify and find it more worth it than other music streaming services. Everyone complains about ads, skips, etc. You have to have premium to really enjoy this app and truthfully the benefits outweigh the $10 cost. Had a few problems in the past but they update often enough to fix."
"Sometimes has connection issues with google home and tends to get ""tunnel vision"" with its song picks. If there's a few songs that get listened to that aren't the usual, the next update to release radar is crawling with similar songs. Gotten pretty slow loading lately. Really don't understand why some of the settings aren't available. Looks like the equalizer that was built in is gone."
"What is up with the ""you may have filters set some results are hidden"" when i search for specific genres? It started a few days ago. Also why are suggested songs still played when automatic play is disabled ?! Weirdly enough the suggested songs are never anything close to what I would ever listen to 🫠 . I reinstalled everything and it's still happening . Other than these 2 things the app is good."
This is a good app. The ads are a little annoying and you can't listen offline if you don't have a premium subscription. I am a fan of the different content you can listen to. I can hear my favorite podcast and listen to audiobooks. I love adding new music to my playlist. Only a 4 star because I hate ads but I respect their purpose.
"Overall, I like the app. I like that I can use my favorite songs as alarms, that the music keeps playing even when the app isn't open, and having podcasts. I have a few issues: 1. Some lyrics on the app are wrong and some are waaay wrong 2. Why was the microphone feature removed? That's dumb. 3. Why did we get our Your Top Songs 2022 in November? The year wasn't over. 4. The home screen was just changed. I like the one that was there the other day. I don't like this new one AT ALL."
"would've rated 5 stars, but I have a couple problems as a Premium user. 1. The old enhanced feature was 10x better. this new one makes it way harder to add songs to a playlist unnecessarily, and is just overall less clean. It feels like a step down. 2. The feature where you tap the name of the playlist at the top and it pulls up the song is great. please stop removing it. Otherwise great app"
"We have been using Spotify for a few years now. As a family we have a paid subscription. I love everything about Spotify except for 1 small thing. It would be great to see you guys add a shuffle option when you are creating a playlist, not just going in and moving songs around yourself. Having that shuffle button I think would be great if you want to change up your playlist from time to time. Especially when adding new songs. If you could do that, I'd be more than happy to give you 100 stars!!"
"Needs one thing! I love Spotify and it's selection, and have been using it almost every day for the past couple years. But I still can't believe there isn't an option to mass add songs from one playlist to another one. I listen to a LOT of music and that feature would make it significantly easier to organize everything."
"Pls get rid of the ""Learn More About Covid"" banners. This is a Podcast App, not WHO. It Clutters Up the GUI. Minus 1 star. Finally! An app that has all my music, and an Uncluttered, Elegant GUI. Well worth a few c3nts a day. 4 months in, I find the radio feature on the app is excellent. It works excellently as you would expect. Artist radio stations have lead me to dozens of new bands. Genre groupings and selections are MUCH better than the competitions' Radio."
Spotify is definitely the app to listen to music but PLEASE PUT THE NEW EPISODES FEATURE BACK FOR PODCASTS. It was well layed out by time when I was looking for recent and unplanned podcasts. Now it's been totally screwed up by the what's new section. It makes it so much harder to keep track of what I've listened to and what I should have next. Sometimes you should just leave a feature as is.
"The only problems with spotify I have are the facts that you can't resume a Playlist after listening to something else, and the search is only really useful if you know what you're looking for exactly. Searches by genre will only get you to Playlists, which is not ideal if, like me, you like concept albums. The playlist system just isn't ideal for that. A play next button would be another missing feature that I wish it had."
"I have and always will love spotify for its ease of use, but lately its been incredibly buggy. The app will crash at random, the integration with my pioneer stereo in my vehicle no longer works, and the list goes on. ---------3/5/23 Having android auto connectivity issues, when Spotify opens it just says ""Spotify is not working right now"". The new DJ feature remains hidden."
"I just swapped from Amazon music due to lag issues and this is 10x better! I don't have to worry about the song stopping midway with the app on, and it always remembers what I was playing! as well as that it's so much more smoother, I actually never had it pause mid song! also I can actually put podcast in playlist. with that there are some songs that I couldn't play before. now sure there are a few songs that aren't on it but honestly, that's not really the app's fault, is it? easy to make acc-"
"I mostly love spotify, but I've noticed a bug that is kinda annoying. Every time I close the app, the playlist I'm listening to changes to the stranger things season 4 soundtrack. I haven't purposely listened to this playlist since 2021, nor do I enjoy it. I don't really mind though because the bug is fun to laugh about every time it happens."
"Works fine. Good content. Still screws up Waze. When both are running, Waze announcements and spoken directions get cut off. I moved from a pixel 4 to a pixel 6, and it still happens. It's really frustrating when trying to navigate with Waze. Been happening forever. You'd think it'd be a priority to fix given the liability. Spotify is the only app that does this to Waze. Other music apps work normally with Waze."
"It's alright, overall everything works for me but sometimes shuffle doesn't work or sometimes spotify gets too comfortable with ads. I was comfortable and completely fine with 1,2 and sometimes 3 ads depending on how long they are. But now I'm constantly getting 3-4 ads at a time and it's becoming pretty annoying. Yeah it's a free plan with ads but up to 4 in one time is crazy. Spotify is still a good app for music and the premium is wonderful too. Just lower the ads a bit."
"Its a great app overall but 1 minor issue that bugs me a lot is the smart shuffle toggle option. If there was a setting to disable the smart shuffle option permanently, that would be really helpful because I never really want recommendations in my playlist when I created a playlist for the sole reason of listening to ONLY the songs in my playlist and nothing else. The old shuffle button was fine the way it was. It was only 2 options that would toggle instantly without needing to load."
"I love using this app. I've saved all my music from the past few years on here, and it's very easy & simple to use. I just wanna say, the new folders update really brought me to review this app, because that is the best feature they've added yet. I love being able to put multiple playlists into a folder, and even put those folders into a folder. Plus, I get to listen to the playlists in the folders on shuffle! This is the best update yet. Thank you so much Spotify, it's so nice using this app!"
I love Spotify except for 1 thing. When I want to hear an album I cant truelly enjoy it. U don't play it from beginning to end and you throw songs in that dont belong to the album. I would understand if I was listen to just the artist and not a particular album. Case in point.....Rick Wakeman's journey to the center of earth. That one definitely needs to be heard from start to finish without jumping around especially if u never hear it before.
"I love this app, been paying for years but a few downsides: *MILITARY* we go on deployment and have our music cancelled after 30 days so if you could add a 90 day payment or something to extend the timeout of the app for those who are without internet for extended periods of time that would be amazing. There's no ""play next"" option besides add to queue, so if you want to adjust you have to press like 4 more buttons when it could be added to the menu options. Device sharing doesn't work well."
The app is amazing the premium version definitely worth keeping it for music or podcasts. The only downside are the ads they play. Like they sometimes play ads based on your listening. But they sometimes play ads not based on your listening experience. Like for example. I listen to rock/metal music. But they sometimes play annoying top 40 or rapm And I don't listen to that type of music. Regardless the app is neat.
"Excellent playback and controls across all my devices. Would recommend to all. Edit: There are some issues with syncing on my Echo Dot 3rd Gen. Lyrics on my phone are not in sync with playback and while pausing is close to instantaneous, resuming takes up to 10 seconds to actually hear playback on the smart speaker. I have tried all the troubleshooting options and it seems to just be a sync problem on their end the devices talking and knowing where they are in the song."
"Great! Except...app will often play non album/radio versions of the songs I voice request. This is frustrating while driving as it is difficult to get the app to play the version I want without typing the song title in. I think Spotify does this to save on licensing fees. Regardless, I feel like I'm getting less than what I am paying for."
"Fairly good experience. The only things I can complain about is shuffle plays alot of the same songs, and the radio for alot of songs are intertwined. It's hard to find new music. Also, it would be cool if you guys made it an option to switch to the Apple OS, where you can just double tap the like button to save songs to playlists. That's pretty cool. Otherwise, great job guys!"
"I've used Spotify for majority of my life it's really good and you won't regret premium, but I dislike that some songs aren't playable because of the country I'm in or it simply not being available. But they recommend music the think you will like and already has a wide selection of preset songs to pick from. Do not recommend if you are not willing to spend money as it will automatically shuffle whatever you play."
"It's really good bang for your buck, especially for students, as their premium & bundle discount for students was really worth 5.99. And now, yrs later, I still use them as they honored the bundle plan I had with them in the past. But I have noticed that the app sometimes acts weird and will stop playing my music. I'll clear the cache, restart it, and itll work normal again, but it's tedious and should be fixed."
"I love the widespan of music, I use it every day, but I hate how it takes one hour or more to get my skips back. Because one time I closed the app after my skips ran out, after I opened it, it took two whole hours to get them back. And the ads suck, because one time I get 1-2 ads, but sometimes I get 4-5 of the same exact thing."
"Pretty good. I switched from a competitor to spotify and was missing a feature they had, but the new AI-DJ mode works to fill that. Albeit, newly liked songs' artists aren't added to the my library list. That would help me out a lot. Lol. Js. Overall, I'm pleased with my decision to switch to Spotify."
I appreciate the ease in finding songs I'm looking for as well as having forgotten old time favorites being suggested. The ads can be troublesome but that's the nature of the business. They're still much less of a nuisance than they are in most other places. There are a couple of small issues / problems I wanted to mention but I can't think of what they are at this moment. I believe one thing was related to the organizing but they werent big issues by any means.
"I've been using Spotify for a long time now, never had any problems until now. My music will play out of no where while using another app, and my Spotify isn't even open. It just plays out of nowhere and I have to physically go in the app to pause it. It's been happening a lot more since I updated the app."
"Spotify is the bees knees...when it's working correctly. App ""soft crashes"" and freezes, losing the control bar on the bottom all while still playing the music. Only fix is to restart phone. Has been happening for years, Androids and iPhones. Otherwise, premium is tight as heck."
"I honestly love this app. The amount of types of music they have is insanely open. However I feel that when they recommend songs they are taking it too far, some songs I see on my recommended start randomly playing when listening to a playlist without that song on it. All I ask is that I only listen to songs on my playlist and not songs you recommend for me, thank you."
Ad volume is so much louder than music volume. Wish there was an ad volume setting so I don't have to adjust the volume down every time an ad comes on and then back up when music returns. This is especially annoying when listening to Sleep playlists and being woken up by invasively loud ads. Maybe this is meant to be so users will buy a premium subscription. 🤷
"Love it, rated it 4 stars because there is a few things that I don't like. One is that you can't go to the previous song, or restart a song without paying premium. But overall it is amazing, I used YouTube Music until the ads got out of hand which made it unenjoyable so I stopped using it and at first thought this would be the same but I was so happy with my experience I got out of it."
"App works pretty well. I wish when adding to playlist I could add to top of list instead of bottom. Bulk editing of playlists similar to desktop features. Social features would be amazing (share tracks, playlists, etc to my Spotify friends instead of leaving Spotify to share elsewhere). Empower curators, analytic tools, etc. More robust artist to fan and fan to artist features. More to do in app regarding music, I constantly have to leave the platform to do music centric things which seems odd."
"Spotify has the best selection and quality for all types of audio media. My only disappointments are that even though I pay for Spotify Premium, podcasts still have imbedded ads, and that there are some features lacking in their web player. Other than those two things, I love and highly recommend Spotify!"
"I love soptify, it's the best, been using it for years but for some reason when I play one of my Playlist it starts glitching and skipping songs and I can't seem to be able to do anything about it. I've tried uninstalling and installing it again but it's still doing the same this. Please fix this when you can"
"Its amazing, better then Pandora! Altho, while im playin a game on a dif app, the music stops and I have to go through this whole process to get the music going again. Anyways, yall are great! Edit: soo its kinda anoying but for some reason the app didn't tell me that I was on a 14 day trial for premium. Spotify is still great, better then Pandora, but I still kinda wish I knew I was on a trial. And YT gives you better sound quality for free. But anyway, its cool."
My goto music app for everyday listening. I find myself creating playlists and building a library of cool sounds that I didn't know existed prior to Spotify. The premium is worth it My only issue is that the canvas feature where a short video loops over the songs being played are region locked to the bigger markets I suppose. Di Caribbean doesn't get that luxury it seems despite the influence in Caribbean music provides to some of the hugest hits in their catalogue. But good app.
"Prettt great app in general! A little too many ads, in my opinion, and it'd be nice if Spotify would stop messing with features, like now making it so that you can't see what your friends are listening to unless you login through Facebook (a platform I've never used and never intended to use), but otherwise it's a good app."
"New update makes the shuffle algorithm SOOO much better now. For YEARS the algorithm made me shuffle through the same maybe 50 songs in my favorites playlist that includes like ~5000 songs. It neglected like 95% of the songs on it unless I specifically sought out a song on the list, then it would just add that 1 song in & take a random song out of the 50 shuffled. Now it's much more random. I'm listening to songs I haven't heard in years."
Spotify is a really good app for listening to music. But there is one problem. Whenever i try to listen to music it keeps taking me to my lock screen while im trying to search for another song. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it but it didnt do it for 1 minute and it started happening again. Is there any way to fix this?
"I love to use this app, anytime I have something to complete, but I do have some problems with this app, as like some things need to be fix, for example when ever I want to skip some of the songs on a playlist, it says 'slow down, you get 6 skips per hour'(something like that) I want be able to skip some songs on a playlist, continuously, so that I find the song that I want. I also don't like that in requires an Internet connection to be on Spotify. I would liketo listen to music,certaintimes"
"Paying for or even free version, takes to long load up or even downloading is a problem. Especially going into my last month of using the premium. I had to cancel it because I'd never if it'll work properly and even using the free version to listen to exclusive podcasts show. I'm missing a lot and disappointed with app. It became my go to music app Update: (2023) The app works a lot better now"
"Relatively simple interface that seems a bit more pared down compared to Netflix or Hulu (for example) - not a bad thing. It is missing some features though, particularly picture in picture. This is such a crucial thing for me. I often watch something on a flight and having the ability to multitask is amazing. Please add!"
"I got a month to just watch mandalorian at work, and the app has no issues that i can see on my phone. Although i do wish there was a way to force how many downloads can happen at once. I have terrible data at work and when the app is trying to download 3 shows at once, it takes literally hours. Also the download don't happen in order and it seems to be random, which i see no point in doing for shows that need to be watched in chronological order..."
"It's a good app with lots of shows and movies to watch. Even shows that stopped airing on Disney Channel a long time ago, and even shows that aren't made by Disney at all. One problem is the lack of languages for audio and subtitles. There's only about 8 languages to choose from, which doesn't even include languages such as French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, German, Castilian Spanish, Arabic, Norwegian, etc."
Not bad app! really enjoy movies. I feel theres needs to be a little larger of adult animated movie selection or something. I feel a lack of selection why trying to find/look for something I really like. That's why 4 stars. otherwise would be 5. Really enjoy it though. In the long run i dont know if I would keep service for more than a year unless selection is upped just a little.
"The app isn't working at all. The Home screen rarely even loads. And when it does, that's as far as it gets. Absolutely nothing can be played. Update: The total malfunctioning I tracked down to having anything downloaded, especially to external storage. (I verified that my external memory card is fine.) After deleting that, there is still some lagging and slowness, but it's not terrible."
"Lovely app. So many favorites, so much nostalgia. Not the biggest fan of some of the functionality and the captions writing. For example, the ""skip intro"" button disappears at a certain point during the introduction and will not reappear dissimilar to something like Netflix. Additionally, an example with the captions is how, instead of writing what was said, they will just insert that something was spoken in a foreign language, amidst other errors. Overall, good app tho!!!"
"Probably the best movies and tv shows on any streaming service, for me at least. The only thing I have a problem with is that you cannot access the app when you are offline, which makes downloading anything to watch offline useless unless you use mobile data to open it and then turn it off after."
"This is a great streaming app and has almost everything that you could need in one place. It is truly fantastic and is a must have subscription. It is almost perfect but the only thing holding it back from true greatness is performance issues. It usually runs just fine but on some occasions the lag and slower speed is almost unbearable and unwatchable. This problem is thankfully a rarity but the off chance that it does occur, it will make the streaming service almost unrecognizable from before."
"The service itself is fine, but the account management capability is not useful at all. There are multiple options of service choices, but there is no way to switch between them. Even trying to switch to an annual plan from monthly basically requires you to cancel your subscription before it will let you do anything. 4 stars for the platform/service, 2 stars for the app"
"My family has had a subscription since it first dropped. Disney+ is perfect for us & the first 2 years, there were no complaints to be had. The last year/year and a half its been so hard streaming it to any device. We can never count on it working so we are always pleasantly surprised the very few times it actually loads and streams without error. The app on my phone never loads, my computer never loads titles/doesn't consistently stream a movie or show, & it's not compatible with my TV anymore."
"I love the app! Its complete nostalgia and brings back so many childhood memories. But it really buffers A LOT! I can't sit through anything without it stopping to load. And then it takes a while or it just turns to black and cuts off completely. Its honestly been happening from the beginning and it's quite annoying now. If you guys can do anything to fix it, I would highly appreciate it."
"Overall it is a great experience and the content alone is worth dealing with the bugs. The UI is a little clunky, but it's to be expected since it was just released. This app KILLS memory and battery life. EDIT: I was mistaken; My phone was having issues and needed a factory reset. The app works great. It would be nice to continue onto the next episode when clicking ""play"" instead of starting on the first episode of the batch."
"I enjoy the app, and it seems to run well on both my phone and my smart TV. But there is a feature I would LOVE to see added, and that is customizable lists. I'm a halloween fanatic, and would love to be able to create a list for all my favorite movies to watch in the fall. I could also make a list for Christmas movies, movies/shows to watch with my partner, etc. I've suggested the same feature for Netflix, so I guess we'll see who makes it a feature first."
"Great content but a couple of issues with the app. While there's a watchlist, there is no ""continue watching"" and it does not pick up where I left off. That is the biggest issue. When watching a series it will autoplay the next episode but if I stop watching then come back later it starts over with episode 1 again. Very frustrating! Other than that, great content!"
"Excited to see Disney finally providing a service just ads Netflix & Prime video. In comparison, the price is economical, also. However, my biggest issue is with the development of the app. For example, NO continue watching list. The convenience of being able to quickly resume movies, instead of having to search it every time in order to resume is a bit annoying, in my opinion. In any event, this app is great and do look forward too Disney's future growth in this market."
"I love the app already, but who am I kidding, I loved the app concept before it even came out. Easy to create separate profiles, as well as search by category. The app is well organized, and easily accessible for all to manage. One take away I will mention is while trying to use a different app, the app will not continue to function in a minimized window like other streaming apps, but not a deal breaker, and most likely going to continue to get better with time."
"I'm very excited and happy about the service finally being available, but this review is about the app itself and improvements that are needed. First of all, it's not very ""powerful."" I definitely would be happier if there was the ability to continue where I left off on a movie by seeing my recent movies on the front page, instead, I have to find them again. Second, I've tried to download movies and haven't had much success since it pauses and doesn't resume automatically Will add more later."
"Such a plethora of amazing content all in stunning HD. The service is fantastic. The app...still needs work. There are a few things that need to be fixed and sorted. For instance, some of the titles appear multiple times when doing a broad search. Some titles don't show up when you're browsing through the selection but when you search for it, it comes up. This app doesn't have a recently played feature, which would be great. Some details need to be ironed out but still a great app nonetheless"
"Pros: lots of content. Lots of shows, easy to navigate. User friendly. App Needs: 1. A way to see where you left off in an episode. 2. Another episode to play right after you finish one. 3. To be able to see what you have watched before and what you still havent watched. 4. This one might be difficult, but would love if all the old original movies could be remastered. It's a bummer to see Brink, Boy Meets World, etc on a 4k TV and for it to look like a pixelated box."
"I love the idea of this app. However, it does need some tweaks. My show will freeze sometimes for no reason, it says I have no internet connection when I clearly do, and it doesn't pick up on the shows I left out on. There is more that I can't think of at the moment, amazing idea but please fix the bugs I understand it's new but I had a bit more faith in Disney+ it is a Disney product (I'm assuming) afterall."
"As far as a streaming app it's pretty solid. It is missing a ""cotinue watching"" type feature because if you leave in the middle of a movie or are watching a show you need to re-find it and remember what episode you are on as it doesn't give you an option to pick back up where you left off or tell you where that was. It does save your spot in the show, just doesnt display a progress bar or resume button or anything until after you've clicked into it."
"The app seems pretty good so far, but sometimes it takes a while to load, or won't load up at all. Also, I get a lot of buffering on movies and I have an excellent connection. Also, need a ""continue watching"" section for if you stop a movie or series part way through. I'm sure these things will get ironed out over time. Selection is great though! Not bad so far. Just a few issues hear and there. Will update to 5 stars when these issues are solved."
Really good app and a huge selection of great shows and movies. Downside is that not everything is released to the application. Some movies are still tied up in contracts and are waiting to be allowed onto the app. I would say about 2% of the actual content is that way. I highly recommend it. Cheaper and great selection are enough to drop hulu and Netflix for me.
"I have been watching on my phone and my x-box 1 S. It plays fine, sound is good, no buffering so far for me. One problem is that depending what I'm watching, it'll either look really clear or be a bit blurry/distorted for the visual. I know it's just the beginning of the release, but I really hope they get it fixed soon. Only other down fall is there is no ""Continue Watching"" section. So until they get that section, I suggest writing down or typing in an electronic where you left off for later."
"Has been smooth and the app is easy to navigate. It's not splashy as Netflix, but I'm sure it will be at some point. The library at launch is HUGE, and there are some surprises there. Overall, it's great. minor gripes: When I watch a film through almost all of the credits, it should play from the beginning the next time I play it instead of restarting in the credits. Also, a suggestion box for content not on the app yet would be great (ie Toy Story of Terror)."
"Disney's latest update has addressed most of the problems I experienced in the beginning. The app feels more intuitive and polished, giving you easy to access features that allow you to enjoy your movie exploring and continuing viewing of your favorite movies. I still experience a problem with my Android. I have to reboot my Galaxy note 9 on a regular basis so that the video will start planning again, this only happens when I come back to continue watching a later date."
"Wonderful selection (as anticipated) but scrolling is a little buggy. I had trouble switching from vertical to horizontal scrolling. Also, they should definitely add brightness control while watching. In the future, it would be really great to create and share playlists of movies, so I could watch marathons like Marvel and Star Wars in a particular order."
"The app overall have been a bit unstable today, but I am assuming that is related to the launch. My main frustration is the app seems to miss a way to resume. I tried watching an old series and it seems like the platform has no idea what I have viewed. When I come back, I must remember ehich episode I stopped on, or if I stopped in the middle of one. This lack of watch history will become increasingly frustrating as I try to watch some of the original series and we get more episodes."
"A couple problems I have with this app: I can't watch my downloaded movies without an internet connection. I don't know if this is a bug or what, but I'd love it to be fixed or changed. Also, I hate how in the continue watching section, it just automatically plays your movie from where you left off. I want it instead to take me to the movies menu so I can select other things like extras, or other episodes if it's a TV show. Other than that, I live this app. Great movies at a killer price."
"I just got it and it won't load on either device, roku TV and Samsung android phone. The tv says to check my internet connection, although it's working fine, and my phone says it's having problems loading and please try later if the problem persists. My kids are very disappointed... UPDATE: It works much better now. It still needs a few tweaks, but there is a good variety of programming available. EDIT: It works fairly well now, only buffers when 2 devices are connected at the same time."
"Xbox One: When you click on a previous watched, it automatically queues into the episode. Nice when you want to go directly where u left off, but if you want to change an episode you need to re-search the title to get those options. This sucks when you are typing on a controller, and personally I'd rather have the episode list info appear every time regardless. An extra click for 'play episode' or typing on a controller? Easy decision. Overall, fair price, good quality, content for all ages."
Love everything except for sound and picture. I know that sounds stupid but not every movie is 5 channels or more and most movies are HD (which looks great) not HD 4k (which looks amazing!). I would only take a 1/2 star away but that's not possible. Overall it's one of the best streaming services out there for popular movies just don't expect to find new low budget movies.
"#1 content, not so user friendly streaming service. I would like to see a ""Continue Watching"" section on the home screen so I don't have to navigate to the shows I want to continue watching everytime. Also, the ability to continue a series on the episode you ended on would be great, without having to navigate to the episode you ended on everytime."
"(A)The snip of episodes/movies being watched doesn't show a timeline (probably wrong terminology). It'd be nice to have something like the other steaming apps, that can show kind of where I left off in the episode from the thumbnail image vs going into each episode, hoping it's the one I watched last. (B) When I select a title and tap the play (from the top) vs to scrolling all the way to the episodes, it doesn't jump to where I left off- starts over from beginning of Ep. 1. Loving it otherwise!"
"It seems a lot of people have had problems getting disney plus to work. I didn't, and I can say that I've only experienced minor glitches while using it on my PC, TV, Roku, and phone. I like their choice of movies and shows and really hope they keep expanding it. PS I absolutely love the Mandalorian, well worth the 7 bucks I spent. My biggest complaint is that there's no resume option for movies or shows."
"The app is great there is a problem I've had recently since i have gotten it,that on the first day of usage it crashes it doesn't happen much anymore but it does crash at times. Also some shows that i was hoping to watch that dont get aired as much on Disney channel are not on there. There is much to chose from but if you can update the shows and movies that would be great."
"The experience is getting better. Launch day was terrible, but it seems most kinks have been worked out and it's extremely reliable now. They've just introduced the ""continue watching"" feature which is AWESOME. That was the biggest issue I had, and it's fixed. So if they could develop the functionality of Netflix's drag and view along the movie progress bar, I would give a 5. Challenge accepted Disney dev team??"
"The content of the service, depending on your tastes, is excellent and a wide variety of shows and movies, including some truly amazing 'original content'. However, the app itself needs improvement. Navigating through the fields looking for something to watch, playback, rewinding and fast forwarding, loading of screens and episodes or movies, is slow and cumbersome compared to Netflix or Hulu even if you have fast internet. Overall you can't beat the price/value of this service though."
"The app seems really we'll put together and there's a ton of content! There's alot to improve on. For instance, the swipe mechanic is wacky and I've noticed that it's very hard to swipe side to side for different movies in the same category. Also the icon changing feature doesn't work and I can't make a different profile picture change. Hope this is improved soon"
Everything is great. The quality and movie options. But most of the time i have to cancel out of the movie because of an error 83. It just says cancel and i have to get out of the whole screen to fix it!!!! Also whenever i goto full screen it doesnt say anything about error 83 but it goesand just says disney+. And whenever i esc out of it it says error 83. Also you should put another option to try again. Thank you and good app i like it.
"Almost a Home Run. You should add a Continue Watching or a Jump in... option. Can't see it. If you're watching something and close the app and you don't remember what you were watching you are out of luck. Other than that, excellent. Haven't had any issues at all. Update: ""Issue"" solved. 4 stars. New Issue. Loading time. I have no issues with other streaming services. The buffering while streamin on Disney+ is constant."
"I love seeing all the movies and shows from when I was a kid. But I wish this app had a list that you could keep all the shows you want to watch. The watchlist only temporarily keeps them on there and as soon as you click it it disappears off the watchlist. I also wish it had a continue to watch section, showing you the video/show you just finished watching or am in the middle of watching."
"Great selection, just needs a few minor tweaks that would make it better. Like having your watch history, having the shows you save to your watch list on the homepage, and having shows and movies remember where you left off. Can't stand having to hit the time bar searching for the place I left in a movie. It doesn't do it all the time, only when I close the app completely is when I have to do that. And it just needs a more complete list of movies (marvel for example). All in all decent app! 😁"
"It's a new service that was buggy first few hours at launch. Much better since. The interface is simple, easy to navigate. There are complaints for ratios on some shows, which they've addressed and are fixing. Coming soon label would be a good add, but overall they've got a good deal of it right off the bat. It is Disney after all. I'm excited to see how the content and app evolve."
"I was absolutely ecstatic when Disney announced this streaming service!! I was counting down the days until Nov. 12! I love Disney+ and all of the shows/movies that come with it. I've been watching my favorite DCOMS recently haha. My only issues are that there isn't a ""My List"" like Netflix or something that says ""Continue Watching"", so if I have to close out of the movie or show, then I have to search for it again to finish watching. It also glitches sometimes in the movies."
"I was all excited for the Disney app but now that I've downloaded it I could hardly see some of the shows on my device, which is an Android phone. It is also very slow reacting to load any other shows to main screen menu. When I try to click on some shows it just pops up as error and kicks me out. It is more likely due to the launch but other than that love it"
"Pretty good all around, but not without a little bit wrong here and there. The things that I wish would be changed (btw I'm on mobile). 1. I don't like that the watch list is almost hidden under the user tab: I almost thought that it wasn't there. Moving it to the main screen so it's 1 click and you can see your watch list, or maybe have your watch list in one of the areas like how's there's the reccomend for you area. 2. This is the most annoying, why is there no continue watching.plz fix!!!"
"The app is perfect for watching movies you love from going up as a kid or enjoyed as an adult. But the two things that really bother me is the removal of some movies saying everything on there is licensed by disney, and extra payment for certain movies that realistically should come with the price you pay for the subscription itself. Also the app is not responding as of late and I would really like to be able to use it on all platforms considering that I'm paying for it. Please see to fix this."
"Every time I turn on smart view and connect to my tv, video doesn't work. Will uninstall and try again next month. It's free for a year with Verizon. They have 12 months to win me over before I cancel. Now works great! Nice selection of movies and cartoons. My kids love it as well. 4 stars because when you want to continue watching something you have to search for it. Does not show what you were watching when you come back to the app."
"Needs a few tweaks but I love it so far! I have noticed that there isn't a ""continue watching"" feature which is sort of a drag. For our household, movies and shows do not get finished in one sitting and when the little ones want to continue watching it, we have to go back and search through everything. But we do love all the content! Just a few minor tweaks to make and it will be perfect!"
"I love this service. If you ever used Netflix or Hulu and found yourself wondering why certain old Disney shows or movies weren't on there, you'll love this streaming service. I am surprised and excited at everything the service has to offer. As far as the actual app itself, I am having lots of issues. I have a Galaxy S8 and often use ""smart view"" to stream the content from my phone to my Samsung smart TV. This works well for episodes of series' on the app, but will not work on ANY movie."
"Disney + is going to rock. App needs some work though. First off if you start a show and dont finish it, then go back later, it does not bookmark for you. The show starts over from the beginning. Second, when casting to chromecast, when you hit the stop casting button, it does not stop. I have to go in to my google home app and stop the cast that way. I also am not a huge fan of the horizontal scrolling. It just doesn't work very well. I would rather have groups, then vertical scroll."
"I'm in love with so many of the movie options. They've got all the old classics plus all my sons favorite new movies. My only complaint is that I cant watch on my tv. I plug my phone into the HDMI and my app crashes and I have to uninstall it, restart my phone and then reinstall it. It's getting really aggravating. If that were fixed I'd definitely be leaving a five star review."
"Initially had some issues accessing the app, but it seems to have been very quickly resolved. Also, sometimes when you open the app it goes straight into the menu, and then after a couple secs it cuts to the opening 'Disney+' animation -- that is supposed to play when you open the app -- and it brings you right back to the beginning. Slightly annoying, but I'm sure that will be worked out. I would love to see a 'continue watching' row, as it would make continuing a series or movie simpler."
"I absolutely love having all these movies and shows basically at my fingertips. The only reason I'm not giving it 4 stars is because for some reason it will only show a certain number of titles I have added to my watchlist. Others it shows are on the watchlist, but do not show up on the list itself. While still others that I know I have added are either not on the watchlist (hidden or visible neither one) or the app won't allow me to add them in the first place. Somewhat annoying so please fix."
"Would totally give this app (and Disney+) a 5 star if not for 2 things. First, every time you watch something at some point the images pause but the sound keeps going. One of two things happen in this case. 1. The pictures will rush to catch up after a minute. Or 2. It goes back to the dialogue of the picture. And second, there is a cap on how many things you can put on your watchlist, this is very frustrating. Fix these and I will happily change it to a five star."
Pretty much everything works but the casting will disconnect whether it's paused or not and I have to turn the WiFi off and on and then cast again in order to pause or play again. That is a huge inconvenience and needs to be addressed. Also I think it would be more user friendly to have a way to get to the watchlist without having to go to the account option to do so. The account option could easily go in the upper left hand corner and leave the watchlist as an option by itself
"This app is nearly excellent. I've only two issues. First, I'm unable to direct downloads to my sd card as opposed to my phone's storage. Second, and this is more of a Disney+ issue, the section for the old Mickey Mouse Club episodes only has a total of five shows. I'm thinking they produced a lot more than just five. Beyond that, the app itself works great!"
Amazing show selection wouldnt change it for the world. But the app itself runs poorly. You get these green boxes turning shows that can be fixed by closing out and reopening it but I'd like it to not be an issue. As well as sometimes the shows wont play. And would be great if the app onew what show you were on and where you were in the show. Other than that it awesome to see all the shows I grew up with and all the amazing movies Disney has.
"Love this app. It came at the right time during quarantine. Love being able to watch my childhood favorites and Marvel movies whenever I want. Three complaints: It's been freezing or signing me out at random over the last few months. Sometimes I can get an error message after hitting the pause button, then I have to close the app and start over. I wish the 'continue watching' section were at the top when the app opens so I don't have to search for it again."
"Navigating the app is less than pleasant. The menu is very basic and there's no way to access playback statistics during viewing. In fact the whole thing feels a lot like a children's toy and not a streaming app. Other than that, it's Disney, so the content makes the other shortcomings more excusable. I love the NatGeo content, and my son has endless classics to discover and enjoy. Still, I have to say, it almost appears like they were lazy in the design because they knew they could be."
"Absolutely love it!!My only wish is that they would add the ability to skip to the next episode in the series between the end of the show &the credits, kinda like Netflix has. Super frustrating for the kids to have to sit through the credits AND a TWENTY second countdown waiting for the next episode. To get past that I have to back out of the play, go to the episode list, remember which one we are on, &select the next one. Doesnt seem like a lot of work, but bad timing can make it awful"
"I keep getting an error message when trying to play some movies. The message says ""the requested media is not available. Please try again. (error code 41) It is popping up on several movies. aladdin for example. Also it is not allowing me to add certain items to my play list. Finally, can we add an option where we can watch in miniature view. For example. Netflix, starz, and Amazon prime, allows miniature view where I can minimize the video and use my phone for other things"
"I'd like to start by saying the selection is amazing, 10/10! Pretty much everything Id want to watch is here. As for the UI, that's where the review falls. They fixed the issue with being able to see recently played content. However it still doesnt say what you've watched, there's no screen in screen, and you cannot use Bluetooth to control, my headphones work to pause every other service I've used. If they add these two features and make the watchlist on the front page, theyd get 5/5 from me!"
"So far, so good. Of course, it's a new streamer so it's going to have a few glitches. It worked ok on PS4, Samsung phone, and my cheap-o tablet. I absolutely LOVE the selection. However, I do have a couple suggestions for future changes: 1) more categories to select from at home page 2) a rating system to help better understand what consumers are looking for 3) a suggestion column that is personalized by a user's particular interests and ratings Thanks so much"
I'm happy with the app and the service overall. My only complaints are that the device won't resume at the same place if I stop and restart a show at different times and that disconnecting from Chromecast is strange. Sometimes the show has to be playing to disconnect and other times it has to be paused. I also had it disconnect on my phone and remain showing on the Chromecast device. None of these issues are show stoppers but I'm hoping that the developers will fix them.
So far the app won't work. It's experiencing difficulties on every platform. Update: I was a pre-sale and had awaited the start of a great new app for viewing Disney and Marvel movies. I believe that the inability to view anything the first few days was due to the demand. However Disney never put it out there that they had problems. I'm glad to see that they were fixed and I have been using Disney+ on my LG TV.
I would have given the app a 5 🌟 rating. But unfortunately the app began to glitch after only a month of having it. For instance I click the magnified glass to search for a movie. Then where it says feature then all movies a-z I'm scrolling and when I'm movie half way thru the list. It automatically goes back to the beginning of the list. Just like that. So I try once more and now it won't let me browse through the list. This needs to be fixed...
"Good not great The content on this is what you're here for, and on that Disney plus delivers in every way. However, the ease of use found in other streaming apps (Netflix I'm talking about Netflix), hasn't been fully achieved. I would say my review will change in future updates to the app but as of now you may find some difficulty transitioning from ""other streaming apps"""
"Great app, very thankful to have all the classics available! Suggested changes that would make this a 5 star rating: 1. Video plays 20 seconds from where I left off when I continue watching. Video should play right where I left off. 2. On my phone, I have to navigate my way to my watchlist. Watchlist is not available on home screen. 3. For us late night, in the dark movie watchers, it would be helpful to have a screen dimming feature (Netflix has a great system here)."
"Given the 'age' it is a great streaming application. Some features are still a little clunky, not integrated well, or just missing. However, what is there is usable and fairly stable. The content is a great mix of old and new films and shows from all around the Disney empire, so anyone can find something to enjoy."
"The only reason I didnt give this app 5 stars is because its missing the capability to share and a resume buttons. We've has just a few hiccups with buffering but we understand it's new and will take some time to adjust. So far we love it. We're really enjoying the selection. I just wish I could forward an episode or movie to anyone. For now, just using screen shots to share. Hope to see that function soon. Also adding the resume watching button would be huge."
* Watchlist can only hold 50 movies/shows and will delete movies whenever you add a new one. * Movies all have a plus button whether it's already in your list or not. Would be nice to see a different icon for movies that are already in your list so you don't accidentally delete it when you press the plus button. * Would be nice to have a Recently Watched section so you don't have to manually search for what you're looking for. * Download feature on the app is awesome.
"So far this app is working okay on my LG television. It is missing a ""resume"" function, so when I stop watching a long episode or a movie and try to come back to it, I have to forward through to find the spot I left off on. I'm trying to just be patient, though. They just went live. The captioning is well done and so far available on everything I've watched. And I don't have to turn it on each time I choose something new."
"Overall app works great. My biggest complaint is that on phones without a home button you have to back out of the show or you end up fast forwarding whatever you're watching, which is really annoying for quick navigate aways. It is very inconvenient. Little more space across the bottom so that the time bar isn't there would solve the problem."
"App is still buggy. I tried to change my profile picture and name and the change wasn't immediate. when I restarted the app, the profile disappeared entirely and I have no profiles and none of the links/options on the profile page would work. Also clicking on marvel and it tells me there is nothing available even though there are clearly marvel films in the library. I'm happy with the collection of films offered though. Scrolling through there were some pleasant surprises."
"I absolutely L O V E disney plus, although I have one issue. Disney plus doesnt have a continue watching section which can be irritating, since I have to find everything all over again. And if I'm watching a movie or show I haven't seen before, I forget the name and cant find it. So if you are able I would be extremely grateful if this could be fixed. Other than that disney plus is fantastic!"
"The content is GREAT! However, the functionality of the app needs work. It doesn't keep track of what you've watched, or allow you to keep a running list of shows you've started. It doesn't allow for multitasking when you're watching on your mobile device. There is also a lot of lagging and it fast forwards at random. If all of these bugs were fixed though it really could be a 5 star product."
"This app's fantastic, and a much lower price than I expected! (The app gives you a 7-day trial. It says free but they took $1. After 7 days, it costs $6.99.) While nice to have, there are svrl things that need to be done. As previously mentioned, they tell you it's a free trial, but you will need to fork over $1. Not a huge amount, but it is a bit dishonest/misleading. Also, the alphabetical ordering of programs is horrific. You can also bundle with Hulu & ESPN+ for $12.99."
"First, I love this app. The movie/TV show selection is great (Mandalorian is awesome) I have a Samsung Galaxy S8 and your app is the only one that I can barely hear audio from.  I have the volume up to its max and i can barely hear it.  I've tried wiping app data/cache, uninstalling and reinstalling the Disney + app and even reformatting my phone.  Netflix, Hulu and Prime Video all work fine, it's just this app.  Any ideas?  It's the same whether I download the movie or stream it.   Thanks"
"I love Disney and am so glad they came out with this app. However, it only works about 80% of the time. When I'm watching shows it randomly freezes or it won't load the episode. And when the app starts acting up it makes my phone lag, which is really annoying. And it's a downside since I love watching all the Disney shows and movies."
"Love this app! It has all the classics as well as the new. It also branches out into so many other areas like Marvel, Star Wars, 20th Century Fox and much more. Also, I have not experienced any interruptions while streaming. And it's personizable to each user, with parental controls. ZERO ADDS! The only 2 downsides I have experienced are: 1. It will not do picture in picture on my phone. 2. It wants me to pay $29.99 to see the newest Disney movie ( When I'm already paying for the app. )."
"So far I'm thrilled with this! I wasn't expecting some of the (much) older movies and even those basically 'lost' to the Disney Channel since they never show them and some are not even available on DVD. Don't know why I HAD to turn on my Wifi on my phone for it to work, but..... I will try it later on my Roku. Search is clunky and disappointing. At one time the menu showed 'Musicals' but then completely disappeared. 😕 Can watch movies I wasn't sure about buying. 😀"
Great having all Disney shows and movies in one place. My only grievance is that I would like to be able to resume a movie or show where I stopped it. Netflix will save your place in a film even after having logged off and logged back on. With Disney + I have to clock my place in a movie before I stop it and fast forward back to that time to pick up where I stopped. T'wer not for this I would rate it 5 stars.
"Great app. Brings back alot of memories from my childhood. I have noticed an issue though while using it on my PS4 while looking through different tabs, the titles will sometimes pop up again. Not a big deal but I ran into one where it copied 4 titles in a row. They were right under themselves. Sadly it seemed to happen quite often. I would say it made the tab 3 times longer than it could've been. And there were some good shows all the way at the bottom."
"I've spent most of my morning watching Pixar shorts and exploring the platform. A few bugs to point out: I'm unable to add items to my watchlist at the moment, some categories show up blank (like Marvel Series and Specials), and I can't change my profile icon. I knew the app wasn't going to be perfect on launch day, so I'm not going to complain too much about it. Hopefully these things get fixed soon, along with any other bugs that I potentially haven't encountered."
"Obviously with it being new there are some glitches and server issues, and that's fine. If there is a continue watching list, I haven't found it. I have to constantly go back and find/search my movie just to continue viewing it, and then sometimes, it doesn't save my spout. Not a big issue, but a slight inconvenience."
"I really like the Disney+ app and experience overall - it's so great to see some of the movies that I haven't seen in years and watch some new ones too! A couple of suggestions that I feel would make it 5 stars: when going to the next episode in a series, have like a 5 second countdown where it skips the credits and then automatically plays the next episode; also I would like to see a history of what was watched; lastly, I'd like to see the ability to rate the movies or episodes."
"So far so good! Easy to navigate and love seeing so many of my favorites available! One feature I'd LOVE to see added to the mobile app would be that it continues to play your movie, just in a smaller screen, if you need to open another app while your movie is playing. Netflix does that and I really appreciate it. No constant stopping and starting."
"Disney owns lots of things and the selection is great, however the app could use some improvements. One, you watch everything with your phone sideways, so why does the app force itself into portrait mode until you watch something? Also, the app can just lag out and force you to force reboot your phone sometimes. But really this is a great service with lots of different high quality shows and movies, and it is at least worth a try."
"Edited review: After a full two weeks of not being able to use the app, the latest update as of 11-21-19 seemed to have fixed the issues. Previously, I was unable to watch anything. A blank black screen was my greeting when I tried. Now when I go to play, I'm happy to report that I'm able to load into something quickly and not have any issues. Thanks for fixing it developers, I've been enjoying it immensely now."
"This App is amazing and I highy recommend it, but am giving it an 4 star instead of an 5 due to the fact there are quite an few issues I've encounter while using it. For some reason when am watching the video, the screen would turn black but the audio would keep going. My only soluation to this was to flip my phone so i could see the video again. Not an big issue but could be an simple fix. Other than that, everything is great."
"Disney+ is overall a great streaming platform. It has a ton to watch, finding shows is easy, and its constantly being updated with new content like Hamilton, The Mandalarion, Soul, etc. I watch a ton of Simpsons and Disney+ is my go-to to watch every episode. My main problem with the service, on my phone, is some technical issues. It gets picky about wifi sometimes, and occasionally content will have trouble loading. But overall a good service."
"Lots of content. Definitely worth it if you want the app for more then nostalgia purposes. It has issues with videos freezing. It can happen multiple times, no matter the content. It doesn't remember which episodes you were on if you don't click on the continue watch tab, which can make that a little difficult."
"I watched Avatar for the first time using this app and it was pretty good. The layout is comfortable and everything is organized well. My one concern is that while halfway in the movie, I got this weird green screen with retro colored lines and black spots. It lasted for a whole thirty seconds so I couldn't see anything for that amount of time. (I took a couple of screenshots, but I'm not sure how to upload them.) I could still hear the sound, though. All in all though, really good app."
"I love it and it is well worth the money. It seems to have the occasional buffering issues while on Netflix I dont have that issue. Also I would like the minimized screen when watching and be able to make my own lists of favorites, to watch, kids love it etc. The selection is absolutely amazing though and we really do love it :)"
"For the most part I have enjoyed watching classics and I'm generally fond of anything based on real events or positive, uplifting, factual, movies/shows. Only issue I have is that almost half way into a movie, the app closes and still haven't been able to watch ""perfect game"" beyond 49min then it'll stop. I'm getting ready to uninstall unless it's fixed"
"Missing a lot of quality of life features but I haven't had any connection or playback issues. The ""my list"" feature needs a lot if work so I can find what I want to watch faster i.e filter search by series, year, or alphabetical. The large category buttons on my TV app don't work either. I click on the big MARVEL button and get a black screen. Still even with these flaws the quality of playback and package options can it worth it depending on your viewing interest."
"Good start, but certain things definitely need work. It freezes at least every 5 minutes, I wish there was a more convenient ""continue watching"" section, it lets me add movies to my watchlist but not delete them, and I wish it would let me know when new episodes of shows on my watchlist are released instead of having to check every day."
"Good selection of shows, however this app has way more bugs than it should! You would think a company like Disney could afford to make an app that works, but no. Almost half of the time i start the app the substitles do not work, which is extremely frustrating to me as a hearing impaired person. Also, shows tend to glitch/freeze a lot and get audio/visual lag..which can only be fixed by force closing the app."
"I absolutely adore Netflix! If I'm ever in the mood to watch something new, its my first app opened. However, I (and many others) tend to spend more time searching than watching. Then, you'll find a good show and its either getting removed off the website in the next few days or they've cancelled the next season. Netflix has a good habit of keeping the ""good"" shows and removing the amazing, draw-dropping shows. Also theres a few shows that'll have the fifth season and not the first season."
"Good app, but a bit glitchy. Sometimes, for no apparent reason, the ""continue watching"" section will disappear, which is really annoying. Also, sometimes, when I'm casting to my TV and another episode starts playing, there will be this glitch on my phone so I need to close and swipe the netflix app away and then reopen it for it to start working properly on my phone again (otherwise it will just say it's buffering forever on my phone even though it is playing on the TV)."
"I like most of the content over all , always good quality . Please though for the Xbox version it's extremely annoying that you can't pause after it started just by pressing A infant it will restart the episode which can be really frustrating. If I don't move the joystick then only hitting A should only pause or play unless using the joystick or d pad. It's only a minor thing but please itd make it a better viewing experience. 🙏"
Love it. But would be nice to be able to do something else on my phone still while watching it. Like have a drop down in size screan. So I don't have to pause it everytime I have a text. Read my text respond then have to open it back up an start watching it again. Would definitely give 5 stars if you could fix that. Just saying. Thank you still very happy with Netflix though
An amazing app! But there is a problem it stops and stays loading at 99% for minutes and kicks you from Netflix really makes me mad. Sometimes when I have to use the bathroom I sit there and hold it in barely able to breath trying not to pee my pants just so I dont have to wait hours for it to load to 100%. That's the worst experience. Fix that and you could make an amazing app!
"While Netflix tries to create content for everyone, the app has become cluttered; I'd like to toggle some ""features"" off. While they're trying to include something for everyone, I'd like an easier way to exclude certain content categories - example: reality shows or games. ... They have begun to let the core features slip into disrepair, occasionally, which then takes them weeks and months to fix, but kudos to the teams that actually fix the problems. Overall, Netflix has become overpriced."
"Picture in Picture setting only works sometimes, which is highly aggravating. Wish this would be fixed, used to work all the time, but not anymore, sometimes it'll even work on certain episodes, but not others & i have the app permissions set to allow Picture in Picture. Otherwise, I like it."
"Ever since l switched from Apple to Samsung, I have been experiencing something that I'm really p!$$ed about. So when I'm watching my show, I'll fast forward and it will say 6o bet off and wait for 5 minutes and 9 seconds, and Netflix is really the only thing I watch right now. So if you could respond and fix it, that will be great. Thank you."
"I enjoy having & prefer watching Netflix more than the other premium movie channels like HBO, SHOWTIME ect... for several reasons like the variety of movies, shows, documentaries, comedys, and horror movies as well as international favorites and especially mini series that have more the one season. as well as the movies that have sequels (I, II, III, IV...). and there's hardly any waiting for a certain time / day watch my favorite sagas from start to finish, as many times at my own ."
"Generally, this is a very good app. I am using Netflix on a Samsung Galaxy J3 and it works very well. During streaming, it is clear and consistent. Nighttime viewing is best, as during the day it sometimes stops to reload. Once in awhile, it freezes upon opening. A few times, I had to turn off the cell to ""reboot,"" and then it worked. Even on my smaller screen, the colors pop, the scenes look 3-D, and I don't miss the bigger screens. I love my Netflix-on-a-cell!"
"I love Netflix I really do, the only thing I don't like , which keeps me from giving it 5 stars, is how Netflix treats my 10.5 inch tablet. it is not like the phone and small tablet interface at all. I miss the easy pause in the middle and the 10 second controls. Having to constantly go to the bottom corners is very frustrating and annoying. The tablet in question is Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 in case you wish to know it. I know it's an old one, that is the only one I have of that size."
"Generally, a good app. Wish there was a way to give feedback other than in an app review but... Netflix added a ""smart download"" feature, which I didn't opt into. It downloaded a season of a show in the background that I didn't want to download. This blew through the data plan and well beyond of the relatives I'm staying with, costing them a hefty fee. This feature should have been opt-in."
"I absolutely love Netflix. They have a wonderful selection of things to watch, and the app works almost perfect. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the picture in picture feature has stopped working. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing the cache, restarting my phone, etc, but nothing works. I still get picture in picture to work on my other apps, it's just Netflix that's stopped, so it's not my phone. If you can fix that, I'll add the 5th star to my review."
"Great app. My only issue is that I would like to be able to remove certain movies from my recommendations and also never see them listed ever again in the app. For instance, I shouldn't have to see the movie ""Murder Mystery"" in recently added or trending or romantic comedies. I would prefer the movie not to exist. It just takes up space when I am browsing what to watch. Also, it might be a good idea for Netflix to recommend watching items in my list at random when I open the app."
"I love this app and it has so much content that's always changing. The only thing I wish that I can do is remove movies and episodes from the ""Continue Watching List"" possibly by having a long tap on it and ""Delete from List."" That would be great! I'd like to have a nice clean list that not filled with junk that I accidentally click on and now it ends up on that list."
"This is definitely Netflix (with all its pluses and bountiful minuses). If you want Netflix for a mobile device you've come to the right place. If that's not what you're after, perhaps you took a wrong turn back there somewhere around Albuquerque and ought to ask for directions or find a better map/GPS app. Good luck either way, you're gonna need it!"
"This is a pretty reliable app, and the ability to download HD content to watch offline is a blessing to folks like me with slow internet that struggles to stream consistently.  It's also a pretty lightweight app that doesn't suck up too much memory or get bogged down.  Only one issue I've found, and that's when downloading multiple episodes of a show, sometimes the downloads are super super slow.  If I hit pause then resume, they pick back up at full speed and will stay that way until the next episode begins to download."
"Application usability is a 4, could have some top-end improvements but works well enough. The selection is what turned me away. I subscribed for a decade or more and used to watch almost daily. Then, an unwanted agenda began forming in our country's politics, and instantly seemed to be reflected in the Netflix selection. I haven't watched since, so you're welcome for the free 8-10 months of money, but you won't see anymore from me until the agenda is taken out of the selection."
"I love the app and the design of the layout. But, I have abstained from updating my app for a while now. And that's actually another thing I loved about Netflix - that they let me CHOOSE whether or not I want to update... until now. When I'd open the app, they'll give me a notification that there's a new version of Netflix and if I would like to update it, but I also have the option of Cancel and continuing through without updating. But now my Netflix wont connect, so I think its time :("
"I love Netflix and haven't ever had problems until now. Every time a show starts, theres subtitles. It just happened the other day. I haven't ever used them unless it's a foreign show and they're required. And sometimes partway through watching, it'll just stop and go back to the menu screen. Can't find a way to make sure subtitles are turned off permanently."
"I love Netflix and this app in general. My only complaints are: 1. That I have to update the app or reinstall it every couple of weeks or I can't sign in. 2. Every now and then, programs will fail to play with an error about not being able to find the requested title. The only way I have found to fix that is uninstall and reinstall. Between these 2 issues, I've installed this app dozens of times."
"The only downside to Netflix, besides the content not being Universal and all-encompassing is the inability to contact someone about problems with your account. Most problems have to do with the financial end of things, that being your balance being low. Still there's no way to contact someone to see what you have to do. At the very least it's not shown; no email address is given out as an link to information."
"The app works fine, but if I'm watching something on my phone and then close it out, it never starts where its supposed yoo, or it completely restarts an episode. I have ZERO issues with playing on the PS4. I can close out the android app and open it on there and it never gives me any trouble. I do the majority of watching on my phone, and this is really becoming an issue. Please find a way to fix. This is something I've noticed pretty recently. It hasn't always been this way!"
"I started this with a free month, which ended at the beginning of December. I am using Netflix with chromecast through my galaxy s7 hotspot. I am thrilled to be able to watch everything on Netflix on my TV! There are some bugs and issues sometimes that require me to restart everything but for the most part its extremely useful and enjoyable. If I continue to be able to watch the way we are, and the bugs are fixed I will gladly give 5 stars!"
"audio playback issues Netflix! you are great and I love you, but when I watch multiple episodes of a show in a row I am guaranteed that the next episode's audio will begin and then begin again while the video is still playing. and the audio will get slower and slower, all while the initial video continues out of sync. since there isn't a native way to report issues in the app, I'm hoping I can let you know this way. please fix this Netflix."
"I love Netflix! The original shows and movies you guys make are amazing and different. I love discovering new things to watch. I can watch something new every day, even tho I usually stick to what I love, having that option is awesome. I do however HATE that 'Friends' is no longer available to stream whenever and wherever. It was the ONLY thing I constantly watched. It's my absolute favorite. I find myself using Netflix less than I used to, because of it being taken off. I hope it can return"
"In the future I would like to see Netflix implement a random viewing option for My List. I have a very extensive watchlist and sometimes I dont want to have to pick and choose between great options. Sometimes I just want to gamble and take a chance on any of my preferred movies from my watchlist. It would be like ""Spin the Wheel"" for My List. Otherwise, the Android app is a solid user experience. Cheers!"
"Really good app. I have bad internet, yet it loads very fast. I only have one problem. on mobile, (the platform i use it on most) you might end up with really bad video quality (like 140 p on YouTube). this doesn't happen alot. Also, it sometimes (rarely) would not resume the movie/ episode from where you left off, and instead starts over. this has only occurred when it is something i didn't watch for a long time. that is all."
"This app actually works and well, all the time. I would like to see the option to tur off the irritating 'are you still watching' prompt that requires you to click 'continue'. Sometimes this happens after every single episode or movie and sometimes it does not happen at all. It should be allowed to turn it off as it is maddenig to have to stop what you are doing, wash your hands and get to the screen in time to click on the 'continue' button or it will close what you are watching and restart"
"It's what you'd expect from Netflix. It's easy and simple to use. Second screen supported as well. There is however one main problem. If you drop data connection, like to 3g or less, the app will kick you out due to your speed being to slow. Now the main issue with that is that the app does not reset itself once you fix your connection, you actually have to restart your phone everytime."
Being able to see our viewing activity needs to be something that can be accessed from the main menu while watching on the television. Having to use a separate device and dig into accounts to access it makes no sense. It would be even better if what we watched was automatically marked as watched or at least give us the option to mark things as watched so that we can see it while scrolling because the same things keep coming up as recommendations later.
"I do very much enjoy this app. It has many great features such as removal off the shows, notifications to let you know when new show or movie is out, and much more. A thing I would like to fix is the all of the loading when you want to watch a show. On my screen is shows the regular loading screen and does this for about 7 minutes. If you could fix this or tell me how to fix this problem, I will be sure to put a 5 star review instead of a 4. Have a nice and wonderful day!!!!! :-) :-) :-) :-)"
"The app is really good. I like being able to access so many different types of movies with my family. Some things do tend to annoy me, like the loading, but Netflix can't do anything about that. I would give it five stars, but I do wish they didn't take off some movies so offten. I do understand that it is probably for movie guidelines and such, but it does bring a bit of frustraition. Overall, I enjoy the app!"
"Would like to see more variety of the popular movies old and new, on Netflix, like HBO & Showtime and other premium cable channels have. I find new movies and shows that I've never heard of and they're great! But often I search for a popular, even older, movie and I've never had any luck finding any of them. Would be nice to stop flipping back and forth between my DTv, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Disney, Roku, etc... jus' sayin' Thanks for listening"
"Finding something to watch on Netflix can sometimes be overwhelming because there are so many options, but sometimes that's also the upside. It's annoying that shows available in the US aren't available in my location. Some of the series and movies created by Netflix have been awesome and pricing for a monthly subscription is reasonable. Most shows don't eat up a lot of data to stream. Overall it's a good app."
"could u maybe make it so every time we look at a movie description n ""my list"" we don't have to start back at the beginning when we return to ""my list"" and drag the screen through all the movies we already passed? it gets really annoying having 2 go through all the movies over and over again especially if you have a long my list. let alone you struggle to keep track of what movies you looked into. 4stars only because of this. Netflix cust. serv is excellent, a selection of movies to keep any busy"
"The algorithm is great. If it suggests a show and says there's a 90% match - I've learned to trust it. No matter how odd the show looks. The opposite is also true. Sometimes a show looks great, but it says it's just a 60% match - no way. I miss the old rating style though. Simply having a thumbs up or thumbs down isn't very clear. I most watch things I'm matched with so it doesn't matter, but if someone was just starting out - seems like you'd want a ""meh"" selection, too."
"I tried this again recently and if I had more hotspot to cast to my TV I would have subscribed. Movies were coming in over data screaming fast for me, and I don't have the best service or live near town. Smooth, clear play with very few moments of buffering. Only 4 stars because as usual most movies were old and many available on free streaming apps. I always like the documentaries, but again was a little disappointed with the dates made on most. A+++ for Series!! I was consumed by a few."
"ITS MY GO TO APP for movies and shows. Has to of the line shows and movies. Great visual quality for viewing the movies. One thing I don't like is if you have a movie or show running and like me I like to hear noise when I am asleep. The app server has to log you out if you don't respond stating your still viewing shows. But Netflix original is exactly that! You won't find a network as universal, yet not atypical from the rest of the selections out there"
"Amazing app. The app is overall amazing with very high quality. I do love the download feature. My only problem is I had to download it and uninstall it a few times, due to the fact that it states 'Video Unable To Be Opened."" Or ""An error has acured."" Something along the lines of that. But overall great! I uninstall it then reinstall it, and it works."
"Allows access to a service that has a fair selection of entertainments. Original and otherwise, the entertainments are about as good as TV. Can no longer be used in landscape mode because of a recent update that uses data (for no good reason) to give a fullscreen preview of the thing you wish to watch. The preview currently doesn't slide up out of the way when scrolling through episodes (which I used to do.) Aside from that, it's a great app that allows access to a pretty good streaming service."
"Honestly, Netflix is a great app to have and stream movies and the like. But unfortunately, I've been having problems with downloads such as getting an error code for 5.7. I've restarted my system settings twice and it still won't let me watch what I've downloaded. I've been patient with it but now it's really started to get annoying."
Generally works very smoothly on my phone (S10 Lite). My gripe is that I like to download to my phone and for some reason it likes to pause itself. It gets annoying when I'm trying to download a season and two hours later it's still on episode 1 or 2. The notification says it's downloading but if I look in the app it's been paused. Otherwise it works great.
"Overal, the quality is great! It fits all my screens perfectly, there's no problem with sound or images. However, I'm having trouble running it on my Cromebook, at first I did think there may have been something wrong with the device and not the app, but after I got it checked, there was nothing wrong. In conclusion: grest quality, I just hope that they fix the problem on cromebooks."
"Netflix is a great streaming service. The only issue I've run into is when I'm attempting to download shows for when I'm offline. If I ever pause a download, or if the connection to the WiFi is lost during download, the shows stop downloading completely, even when wifi returns. It acts like it is downloading, but remains at the same percentage. The only way to fix this is to uninstall and reinstall the app, loosing any downloaded content in the process."
"I use a subscription based on living in Southeast Asia, the content seems to be coming out quick enough, but not nearly as updated when I used an American account, nor does it offer as much content. A little disappointing on these two notes, but this is still a great app, with great features. Well done, Netflix."
"The service has been really great for me, I love every bit of it but I have a request concerning translational issues revolving shows and movies. They don't all have the ability to translate to the language you prefer or subtitles you want to be reading. Please check if you can add language and close captioning preferences to the shows/movies that don't have the option to watch them that way. Thanks!"
"So I see a few reviews on here. And guys to the one's who are having problems with their Netflix, more than likely your gonna have to upgrade your plan. My Netflix was acting up last week. Moving slow and sometimes not working at all. I had to update my subscription. Luckily for me I'll be paying just $12.99 a month now. So my advice guys is to probably upgrade on your plan. It's the only option."
"Great movie streaming up. Quality is good. Only issue that comes up is sometimes it will get stuck after you start a movie you had stopped watching. To fix the issue, just have to close the app and restart it. Easy fix but can be slighty annoying if you have started and stopped watching several times. Nonetheless very minor issue. Tons of choices to watch for the whole family."
"Wonderful for streaming movies or shows of any kind with great HD performance. Subtitles typically load and follow up fine, audio is clear. One thing I'd like to complain about because I just don't understand, is the fact that the American Netflix has more than we do. Is it because that's where headquarters is? Because I'd still very much like to watch some select things that I can't because it was taken off of my country's Netflix."
"Great app for when away from home. Has a very useful download feature for if you find yourself living in/ visiting an area you know has low or no connectivity. That said, the download feature is glitchy, it frequently hangs or works slowly; could use some way to assign it higher or lower priority. D/l will not work at all if you are watching something at the same time, (even if it is downloaded to your device and you're not streaming) which is kind of a bummer."
"Wish there was a way to permanently remove items that don't interest me from recommendations to streamline browsing. Also, it's kind of challenging to find new types of programs not based on what I've already watched. Other than that, solid app with very few bugs and plenty of entertainment options."
"I really like Netflix, it gives me shows and movies that they only have such as Netflix Orginals. But, I have noticed that on PC it is much much laggier than other devices. Like buffering. (And I use the website, Instead of the app on PC, because it a lot faster) Also I don't think the smart downloads don't work on my phone, so... Anyways, these are the features I like; the setup(I like that you guys recently put out a mood category), Its a lot faster than Hulu on buffering, lighting settings."
"The Netflix Application has improved quite substantially over the last two years. Not so much in the Visual category, but mostly in the overall smoothness and operation of the app with Excellent rendering, buffing times, and video playback. A very Good app for a Good entertainment viewing experience. One area they should make better is improving and expanding their current selection of Movies from the 70's and 80's as their current selection is Weak."
Netflix content isn't what it once was. But it is the baseline for streaming. I just wish the app would auto skip intros like some other services do. Otherwise it is great when compared to it's competitors as far as the app's technical specs go. I love picture in picture and how fast it skips to the next episode. However it should jump before the black credit screen rolls. Not after. But a minor amount of time. Just get the auto intro skipping down when a show doesn't begin with one.
"Pretty solid video streaming service. No ads. Easily shareable. Wide variety of movies, tv shows, and more. The app is sleek, castable, and more. Only a couple drawbacks. First and foremost is the amount of a show that is available to watch. Many shows only have a fraction of their total episodes available to watch on Netflix, or are extremely behind and even lagging up to years behind the constant releases of a show. Second, some titles are un-downloadable. Netflix doesn't own all the rights."
"My friend introduced me to Netflix. It has worked well on both my Samsung smartphone & laptop. I like the option of having a list of movies, along with the option of downloading for offline viewing. The suggestions offered are helpful sometimes. I got hooked on the entire Frank & Grace series! There are some interesting materials to watch. But seems like there aren't the greatest variety of good movies. Although I like documentaries, etc., it seems there are more of these than good movies."
"This streaming service is great but it just has a slight hiccup as of now, the audio is out of sync for all shows. I didn't see any reports about it so I thought it was my phone. But I tried restarting it 5-6 times, power off & on 3, uninstalling 2 and open and closing it a bunch. The only temporal solution is opening the language setting when the video is playing and click apply. Pls help, it's started to get very annoying. Other than that it fine. Thx for the time"
"This review is only about the app not the lack of good movies. The app's good. I like how I can look for movies based on categories I can switch easily to another profile, I can see previous for movies, and the mini info that you get when you click on a movie that let's you quickly add the movie/show to your list, watch or even share. The one thing I DISLIKE is the subtitles! At least on my galaxy s21 the subtitles occupy the whole screen! I wish they give us the option to modify the size of it."
"Works great most the time, lately buggy. So the picture-in-picture feature hasn't been working since the last update, which is frustrating because I like being able to multitask while watching my shows. When you resume after the picture in picture doesn't work, then all options like subtitles, ability to skip title sequences, change episodes, etc don't pop up until you fully close the app and start again, or exit the video player and resume. Also renew Dark Crystal Age of Resistance 😤"
"It is a really great app, and I love Netflix. My only complaint is that if I turn off my phone, or just hit the home button for my phone, while on Netflix, it will start playing whatever show I was watching like five minutes later. The next time I go onto Netflix ti will have restarted the movie or episode. I am not sure if it is the app or how my phone reacts to the app, but it is really annoying."
"I've had an amazing expierience watching netflix. There are some things that I dislike about netflix, and it's that when I was in the middle of watching ""Switched at Birth"" Netflix had deleted it before I could finish. Although I do understand why you deleted it,it was not that popular and there is more than one person who watches Netflix in the world. So overall I think this is a great app to watch some of your favorite shows on."
"The app is fairly good, only problem I have (which may just be my phone) is that sometimes the movie or show will stop and freeze. You can't fix it by leaving the app and coming back, you can't fix it by turning on and off my phone. Nothing. It doesn't freeze my whole phone, but I can't use Netflix for an hour or two But apart from that, (which, I insist, may just be a problem for my phone) I like the app very much and use it a lot."
"Overall good interface for using Netflix on mobile. One thing that they REALLY need to fix is how the app takes over your device's brightness. Having a brightness slider in the video controls doesn't add any benefit because it's easy enough to change brightness on most Android platforms. If it NEEDS to be there, at least add an option to switch between using the in-app brightness control and the device brightness. The only current way to fix it if you accidentally change it is to reset the app."
Great shows great movies. But you have to update seems like every week or it takes FOREVER to load. And of course it takes FOREVER when updating. Also I want to throw something through the tv when it asks me if I'm still watching netflix. OF COURSE I'm still watching. If I wasnt I would turn it off. That is such an annoying thing. Seems small. But I know im not the only one that gets this
"I've had Netflix for a very long time, and I still love it. Although, I wish there was a search option for the percent match. I also wish it would give you a straight-up reccomended list instead of just saying ""Because you watched __"". Also, a problem I have sometimes is if I exit Netflix on my phone, it will continue to play the audio from the show I was watching as if it is in screen-on-screen mode. This doesn't happen all the time, though."
The video loads quicker and buffers less than Hulu. I like the pop-up player/screen. Need to be able to remove/hide categories to say not that interested. At least from the main page. Also quite putting things I have already seen on Netflix in my recommendations. Definitely not right above the watch again it the same in shows different order.
"Love it. Can't complain too much, there've been a good variety of shows and movies. Was excited for the chromecast option directly IN the app, but after just a few days of that discovery... it's gone after update! SmartCast is still an option, but that's just annoying to hook up (and you can't check on your phone w/o interrupting the cast) BRING BACK CHROMECAST OPTION!"
"My only current complaint is that downloads are so limited. My situation demands that I use my phone's data at night if I can't have a show downloaded. Also, I watch the same parts repeatedly as I use it as an insomnia cure so data is often wasted without downloadability. If I were allowed to download & delete the same show repeatedly, without limit to the number of times (such as on Amazon's service), I would use that feature much more & increase my usage, and support, of Netflix in general."
"Best quality streaming I've seen from any app. But please bring back the running time clock (not just the ""remaining"" clock), like other apps. There's no good reason for making it so difficult for us to know how much of a title has been watched... Let alone re-find our place in the movie whenever an accidental screen touch messes up our progress."
"Netflix was great and I have had an account for years, and I said was, until all their new HD episodes started playing extremely dark. I called them and got the ""we're working on it"" generic speech. That was 4 months ago, and their have been several updates since. Here's an idea, go back to when it worked correctly, compare, and undo what was done incorrectly. I almost believe they are doing it on purpose at this point. Maybe a beef with Samsung... Update: Bug was finally fixed, kinda."
"So, overall great app. Good content, smooth interface, user-friendly recommendations and control. 10/10 would recommend. Of all streaming apps, purely based on quality of user interface and ease of use, it's my favorite streaming app. I do, however, wish we could manually select video quality the way YouTube does. I'd rather wait for a video to load than watch it in lower quality. Netflix just plays the video however it can. For someone picky about quality, that's very annoying."
"The content is great, but my screen is very dark. In order to see the screen, I have to turn my lights out, and the screen all the way up. And it's STILL DARK. Not much fun. Been into settings, fooled around with them. Looked up online how to make it brighter. I don't have the buttons they talk about. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Same deal; I can see Netflix ok (not well) until I start playback. Then I can't see it very well, at all."
"Been with Netflix for over 10 years. I like the variety but really wish for newer, more and better documentaries in more varied categories. I have one complaint, I do not like the interpretation message ""Are you still watching"" . It's useless, whether I'm sleeping or not doesn't matter, I'm paying for the service, I hate that it interrupts to ask a useless question and I must get remote and turn light on to see so I can click ""yes"" when it doesn't matter. What an inconvenience!"
"Great app, but if your settings to your phone are even slightly altered (or unaltered), the sudden change-up in WiFi connex can stop you in your tracks until everything freezes so long that it completely closes the app. That can get pretty aggravating. I also don't like the fact they never add any good haunting/haunted shows (in my opinion). I'd also like to see more I.D. TV shows for sure."
"netflix is awesome! I can get a lot of my favorite shows using this app. My only complaints are that they often remove stuff. They removed my favorite show when I was at the end of season 1, so I have to go to stream or online. Also it is awful laggy and will start randomly loading in the middle of an episode. I would've given it stars if not for these issues. Otherwise, I LOVE THOS APP!!!"
"Amazing content with subpar video player. Netflix does have a lot of fantastic content, albeit it's a bit too expensive compared to its competitors. The media player on Android TV OS however, has subpar features. For eg. one can't rewind or forward the video by 10s upon a single press of the seek buttons; pressing back a few times should cause the app to exit, but that doesn't work either. These are simple things to improve user experience & can be easily implemented. Needs improvement for sure."
"Great app. Very few glitches... new update is confusing. ""Home"" is no longer where you find the stuff you've been watching all along. It's now at the ""explore"" section. I get that Netflix want to improve the experience but searching to try and find my shows is annoying. Maybe then make the ""explore"" page open as the app launches. Other than that, we good."
The app is generally great. Lots of my favorite movies and series. I wanted to rate it 4.5 but I can't. The only problem I have so far is that when you stop downloading a movie or series it will still show a downloading icon. This usually makes it hard to start the download all over again and the movie won't even show in the downloads section. I think they should fix this problem. There are no ads and the app is very easy to use. I just hope they can fix that downloads problem
"The mobile app should provide a more comprehensive quality selection. The auto, max, and data saver are imprecise and do not let me change quality while playing a video in video player. Most other OTT platforms allow you to select quality in an easily accessible location. I don't see why netflix can not do the same. Alongside a quality selection option(SD, HD, FullHD,4K), I also get that annoying 5.10 bug when I switch between cruncyroll and netflix. Fix it."
"It is a very nice app but can use some updates, like open more movies in other countries. With that said Netflix is a wonderful, entertaining, beautiful app so much variety of movies to watch with subtitles and different language. So I do recommend it."
"I have watched so many movies since I had surgery back in 08/2022. Netflix offers a lot of entertainment for the amount that you pay a month unless you are home for an extended amount of time. I'm sure many people found the new game of ""Movie Roulette"" while home during the high point of COVID. I happened to be an essential employee during COVID-19 outbreak. So at least I got to keep working. The roulette game is picking a movie by the picture that advertised it on the streaming service."
So far I haven't found any bugs but I really think that they should include network billing to support Telkom billing and other to make it more convenient and I think it will really get more people to use it because it's quicker and easier to understand and it can even help those who aren't able to make a membership plan and can buy it when they can but other then that it is so far in my opinion the best app to watch and stream your movies and series.
From the first day I started using Netflix I've been happy with it the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because some shows are abruptly canceled after only a few episodes which is annoying and some of my favorite series and movies aren't available although it may have to do with my region
Netflix is an amazing app we can see non stop series and movies there is an one missing in Netflix is we all want to see language options that we automatically can chose language type movie most of movies are in other languages that we want see but because of language we can't see. Please see into this problem Thank you for this application
"I think Netflix is wonderful. It mostly has good shows like outer banks, and Stranger Things But the only downside is that they remove alot of jaw dropping shows or movies or like nastolgic movies/shows. For an example my favourite movie is Mean Girls so i looked on Netflix for it because i wanted to watch it again and guess.... yep they took it off and it frustrated me a little because now i had to RENT it on some other platform. So there for the app gets 4/5 stars. but this app is GREAT."
"More than UI, the selection of movies from hollywood is going down in Netflix. Some user friendly UI tips: 1. Anyway to avoid who is watching screen at the startup ? Each person in household has a mobile nowadays. 2. Avoid the brightness settings option in watch screen unless user selects it as an option ? A similar volume slider will be helpful. 3. Take cue from competitors and adopt best ideas. See Amazon Prime app and get ideas."
"Netflix is very good in it's service but I have 2 problems with it , first is that when I use the next episode button it shows that I didn't watch the episode that I just watched. Second is that there is not many anime in Netflix , i need more anime."
"I have noticed that the level of light within the app remains too bright when I am in a low light room, making it difficult to enjoy my favorite movies and shows. such as adjusting the brightness level to a lower setting or enabling a feature that allows the user to reach 0% brightness. This would greatly enhance my viewing experience."
"Beautiful app on TV, laptop or phone. Allows one to watch steadily without buffering issues even if the network is not stable due to loadshedding or other interruptions. Great downloads, recommendations. Just with there were more childrens movies in the selection as much as the grown-up categories, both live action and cartoons. Otherwise, great job Netflix!"
"Hey Netflix, please add Dual Subtitles capabilities. In Asia, this will help multi generational families watch foreign content together. As an example, right now Korean drama fans can only choose either English or Mandarin subtitles but an aged parent may only be able to read mandarin subtitles but her grandchildren may only be able to follow English subtitles. Adding this will allow you to continue your leadership position and also something the government would look upon favorably."
"New update is not good... The auto ""next episode"" timer is WAY OFF! It randomly starts at the end of each episode (when the episode is not finished). It's getting annoying each time it starts and I have to manually stop it, and if I miss it the timer skips to the next episode, even if the current episode is not done... 😮‍💨 Please fix it ASAP..."
"Once User Logged in into Android Device, and scroll Down main page (Home Page) and then click on Search icon for Entering text, It won't open search text box, it is currently opening Category Drop Down. It should open proper text box so user can enter text and search. It is working without scrolling screen as soon as user land on main page, but once user scroll Down page little, it is not working (While sticky bar activated after scrolling). While User is on Another tab like Games & News."
"I think this app is very nice. There are just some concerns that I want to fix. So why are you removing good MOVIES, we downloaded netflix in order to eatch the movies we want, but of course, it's not there because you removed it. I was gonna watch modern family, but you removed it. Please bring them back bring the movies backk~"
"The current version has a small bug when trying to connect wiyh Google Chromecast. The thing is that the Cast icon will work only if you scroll to the very top of the Search screen. But when you scroll down further, the Cast button will not work the way it should, instead it acts more like Browse by category."
"All I want is the ability to mark shows, episodes, and movies as watched. That's it. It's a really great app with many great shows, movies, and a few bad apples, but that's what you get sometimes in life. But I'm not the type to rewatch shows or movies that I already seen. And some I saw before I had Netflix."
"Netflix is one of the famous video streaming in the world, but unfortunately there are so many bugs whenever I'm trying to watch video, especially the episodes disappearance, random episode when ON the autoplay and many more. Another problem is when i clicked on some random video, the video sometimes buffering longer than usual. Hope the developer fix all the bugs & system problems in the next update."
"Hello. The shows are great and the player is good enough, but when I am downloading on a WiFi network for offline watching, it shows that it needs a WiFi connection to resume downloading which has stopped. I have WiFi connection on during the downloading process. Please look after the glitch."
"I would give this app a 5 stars but there is something I don't understand. My question is why do Netflix does not but all of the seasons or/and episodes in the TV show that are not from them, I mean even if they do they take a very very very very very very long time to put it on. For example the show Henry danger, they took so long to put the 4&5 season and its even separate, so exept that and the lighting, which is really disappointing, i love the app!"
This is the only streaming app that can handle seamlessly connecting to the chromecast and never losing my place in a series. I'm deducting one star because it keeps getting rid of series that I'm still in the middle of watching. Some automated notification that they're going soon would be nice.
"I love the selection of shows and that its a package w Disney+. But I don't like the ""Still There"" screen.. it says ""We'd hate for you to miss your show.."" well then pls don't interrupt my binge lol..😂. Maybe add an option in the settings to turn off the ""Still There"" screen.. that'd be nice and it would help you stand out as the only one that offers that.. trying to help make it a better experience for everyone. 🙏 Also its got a bug where if you rewatch a show/movie it starts at the end."
"The content of the streaming service is better than most, with good and popular shows, but the amount of ads (that you can't skip) is way too much. For example, I was watching AOT, but there are one ad at the start, and one right after the opening theme song, with there being 2+ ad breaks during the rest of the episode. You might be saying it's just a little bit of time spent on ads, but there are about four 1.5 minute long ad breaks, which adds up to 6 minutes plus the 20+ minute episodes."
"Everything's pretty good, but the implementation of ads. There are two problems. One, whenever you turn off the show in the middle of an ad, it makes you rewatch the whole ad break length. Not that bad for normal use, but it is annoying. Two, no matter how far back you skip, whether its a few minutes before an ad, or the second before an ad, the ad will play for the full amount of time."
"For the most part the app is consistently reliable, no crazy freezes or shutdowns. The only gripe I have is that items don't drop from my favorites when they expire or are no longer available. Also, I don't know why, but the recommendations are WAY OFF. It's definitely not a deal breaker. Better than many streaming apps currently out there."
"Good app- easy to use for the basics (read further down) maybe not as easy as a big competitor (""N"") but you can find what you're looking for. One thing I haven't been able to figure out is that I can't seem to delete a series I added to my watch list that after a couple episodes I lost interest... Even though I have removed it on several devices it just won't go away. Probably me not knowing how but if that's the case it should be easier..."
Has a great selection of both shows and movies. Only problem for me is that subbtitles are off by about 30-45 seconds. They say the line verbally then about 2 lines later it shows the subtitles for the previous lines. Also it doesn't always save where you left off if you have to close in the middle of an episode.
"love the shows and movies of this service. I don't even mind the 1 day delay sometimes. The app itself is pretty stable for the most part. Be careful you don't brush against the lower links while watching. It's surprisingly easy to do. before you know it, you'll be watching a whole another movie before you finished the first. A bit annoying. Other than that...it's pretty solid."
"I love HULU and the fact that all my favorite shows are on there. navigating the mobile app is much easier than navigating the app with a remote control, I wish navigation with the remote control was easier. If I had only one thing that I'd change on the app, is TO HAVE A LINE UP OF SHOWS THAT HAVE AIRED THAT DAY. I don't like having to search ALL live channels! I wish there was a list to show what came on TODAY, ONLY NEW AIRINGS of shows that came on that day. like a ""what's new today"" lineup."
"The Ads!! Oh my word!! My biggest gripe, other then some of the forced belief shows, is that if you accidentally rewind past a point in the show where an ad is, you are forced to watch another one. That truly isn't very fair if you ask me! I understand that is an option because one can opt out of ads by paying a little more. Just that it almost feels like double dipping."
"Great app. However, I have a few suggestions. Add a skip into/recap button, like Netflix has. Also, the bar at the bottom needs a chance in my opinion. It needs to be slightly bigger, and the feature where you can skip ahead by touching above it is kind of annoying. I've had times where there's a hair or crumb on my screen, and when I go to wipe it off, I end up accidently skipping ahead."
"Love the app but I wish it had better streaming controls like Netflix does. With Netflix, I can go back 30 seconds from my lock screen and even from notifications. With Hulu, I have to go into the app to go back and end up having to go back even more because it takes longer to get into the app. Please work on improving this and I'll change my review."
I absolutely love this app..... but can we please change up the ads. If I have to watch about ankylosing spondylitis one more time I'm gonna drive myself to an institute. Not for the mentally ill but for the purpose of I will be an expert on the subject. It comes on at least twice every commercial break. And seeing how many ads play on one episode of Buffy I'm seeing it alot. I have both versions of the commerical memorized. This app should come with a PhD after you finish a season of a series.
"Good. Hulu is an excellent service and incredibly priced. However, I've given it 4 stars because this app is not perfect. I will give them this, they've picked out very good colors and crafted a beautiful UI, but some things are missing. First of all, I want native picture in picture support. I'd also like manual resolution selection. Finally, and most importantly, videos will quickly stop and start for no reason I can tell. It doesn't happen when the resolution changes or I touch my phone."
"Love it for the library, don't love the interface. I find the streaming quality to be great most of the time (a higher percentage of the time than Netflix) and I've never had to deal with commercials, as I pay to go without them. The app's interface is not my favorite. The way you see suggested shows next to the show you're watching seems clunky and now you can't click the middle of the screen to pause. On top of that, you can't see the title in fullscreen. Casting is a bit slow to get started."
"App works great. It has recommended some shows that I may not have gotten into otherwise. However I have had some issues with downloads. I can't pinpoint the issue specifically. I have played downloads many times when away from an internet connection, but several times they would not play and give me random error messages, not related to expiration or renewal."
"I love this app, it's perfect for streaming all of the advertisements I know and love. I'm not very intelligent, and therefore am incapable of grasping many different products being advertised. Which is why it comforts me to see the same ad for the same product multiple times in one viewing session. However, I'm removing a star for the tendency of this app to interrupt my advertisements with shows. These ""shows"" are a distraction and a nuisance, please hulu, just dispense with them altogether."
"I love Hulu! My only complaint would be that several times while watching an episode of a great show live, Ive lost my connection for a moment and when I get it back have been unable to resume the same program, missing the end of the show! Like I came in a few minutes after the show started so opted to ""watch from beginning"", so the maybe 2 minutes it takes me to reconnect to my wi-fi shouldn't have mattered, but ""poof"", it just disappeared! Otherwise, great app, and very reasonable price!!"
"The Hulu app for Android is, in my opinion, the best execution of a mobile entertainment app on android. The navigation system is easy to use, and its very fast and easy to pick content, while also making sure not to overload you with choices. My only major problem is that Hulu's implementation of scrubbing causes it to falsely think you are scrubbing when your fingers are on the edge of the screen. It also assumes your screen is 16:9, meaning widescreen content can take advantage of 18:9"
"This version on Android seems to work petty well. I wish I could find more things easier. Just browsing, I mean. I do not use the app version on my TV much because it has no settings for quality. This is less a problem on the phone, but I have a hard (and rather low) limit on my tether, and a fairly high soft limit on overall data. So either just be more conservative with my datastream or let me adjust the quality myself please."
One bad thing first. I need to have picture in picture functionality. I can do split screen but it is not the same. The good: This is my favorite streaming platform. I have grown to like the UI design from a few years ago now. It is more rich and stands out. Sometimes I find it does not make it easy to find things that should be more accessible. Commercial free is the way to go and the option to download is great now that covid is wrecking the internet.
"A good app with a good interface and you can use it to cast to a TV. The problem is that if you go out of the app and back to it, you can no longer control the show. It gets stuck wherever you were last (app view) but the show on the TV keeps playing. You cannot pause, rewind, etc. You have to stop casting via Home and re-cast. Kind of annoying."
"Please fix your subtitles, they sometimes get stuck when I go back a few seconds in a video. For example: While playing an episode of Frasier, I went back like 20 seconds and it was stuck with the same subtitles. I had to let the video play up to that time when the subtitle was supposed to be appearing. Only then the subtitle disappeared and the next subtitles started appearing as normal. Also, sometimes the subtitles are out of sync and disappear long before the dialogue finishes."
"The Hulu app is pretty good. The UI is easy to navigate, you can download content for offline viewing, and it has most of the other standard features the other big streaming services have. I love that the background is nice and colorful while you browse. I sometimes make use of the ability to watch the video in portrait mode, where you can see the notification bar for your phone, and also see a list of related videos (including the next episode if applicable). I wish there was a mini-player."
"I like all the anime Hulu has to offer. Superior to the competition. The subtitles on ALL material are much more precise than the competition. However when casting to TV, the competition has a much better ""Casting Screen"". It is nice to see previews, but only I want to see previews. They get in the way of accidentally being clicked on and immediately interrupting whatever is being watched. I hope this is insightful to the developer. Not being critical, just honest."
"Just subscribed and installed the app. The interface is pretty cool with a very wide selection and the video quality seems great. I just spent the better part of an hour scrolling through movies and adding selections to my list. I had to step away so I closed the app. When I returned, none of my selections were saved to ""My Stuff"". That was pretty disheartening. I'll assume I did something wrong.."
"I love using this app, especially since it can carry brand new episodes of tv shows. The only problem I have is that whenever I start the next episode, the video will freeze about 10 seconds in but the audio will keep going. The only way I have found of fixing it is wait till it freezes then back out of the episode and go back in, kind of a turning it off and on approach."
"Very convenient for listening to my news programs on ABC while out of town or otherwise away from home. But ""watching"" my shows on the Hulu app mean I can't multi-task on my phone. It would be nice to adjust settings so it continued to play while my phone is locked or if I go to another app. Like I do with audiobooks. And when I put my unlocked phone in my pocket with the app running, it always seems to bounce to another show on my ""next up"" list before the show I am interested ends."
I like the app but I wish there was more selection for how much a subscription costs. I usually use Hulu for tv and Netflix and other apps for movies because the selection is meh. Also a really annoying feature is that anytime you leave whatever you're watching it returns you to the beginning even if it's just for a second and you have to scroll to where you left off. Other than that it's fine. I do wish they had more movies without needing HBO though I would delete Netflix and keep Hulu.
"More recently I noticed it glitches out when im watching for longer periods of time. i can be in thr middle of episode and it will pop up with the time bar and info, dim the screen and occasionally just pause itself. If i try to pause the show to see if it helps, it will freeze the program and I have to restart my playstation. Happens on my 3 and 4."
"Two big problems with Hulu. 1. The app seems to have way more connectivity issues with my Chromecast than Netflix does. 2. They recently updated how it displays what will autoplay next, which leaves a big block if text over the top of the screen for the last ~6 minutes of the show you are watching. It's really frustrating when the faces of show characters are 95% obscured by text!"
"Streaming isn't consistent. It's not bad, maybe 20 seconds downtime if I just let a whole episode play. Skipping ahead while rewatching a show is almost impossible, the entire app freeze's. It's not my phone, it's a brand new model and I have 5G unlimited data. Never have this issue with Netflix or any of my other streaming apps. I'll give it a few months and see if it gets better. There's more content I'm interested in on Hulu than all of my other streaming apps combined so that's a plus."
"Decent overall, mostly for the content. But wish it went totally Fullscreen on mobile, and my biggest issue is that when I return to an episode when I'm mid way through, or in the middle of watching it, turn my screen off to do something, turn it on ten mins later, and the episode will start over when I hit play even though the marker shows where I was before I press play. I hope devs see this and work on it because it's a constant issue. I'm an android user on a Samsung Galaxy s10 for ref. ty."
"freezes sometimes. other wise great app with an array of options! I only have the basic subscription, not premium so not everything Is available but there are tons of shows that appear on cable that are available on Hulu ""basic"" the next day! it's a great option for those of you who don't have cable or don't want cable. If you chose to go premium you can watch different things live as they are streaming in cable as well as a few different shows and movies that aren't available with Hulu ""basic""!"
"I don't have any issues with this app besides the ads repeating themselves. Yk how there's a timer showing how many seconds you have left? Well once it goes down to the last second, it repeats itself and gives me a whole new set of ads to watch; making me watch a 4-minute ad break. I'm not complaining about the original length of time from the ads since ik I can change that from subscription, but with it repeating? Yeah no. I emailed the company and hopefully they will see my email and fix this."
"Love the selection, but problems. The app isn't marking episodes as watched more than half the time. And to make you watch all those ads before you can advance to further in the episode is extremely frustrating, especially when you're not sure where you stopped watching any episode you started to watch the night before. But I do enjoy the show and movie selections but the ad situation and no marking of episodes is annoying."
"Liked it so far. But, recently having persistent issues with the app. Keep getting errors while watching videos. And, once one error appears, no matter what I do (remove cache, data, force stop, reinstall, restart phone), the same video never plays in the app again. From web browser, it works great. I don't know why Hulu can't have a mobile UX available. Using Desktop Browser feature doesn't help that much."
"I love hulu so much expecially with my student account. Its so nice to have access to all these great shows. Unfortunatally it doesnt get 5 stars because I have a lot of hassles with the app on my phone. It cuts off all the time and stops loading. It only works again when I restart my phone. Still a great platform, just wish the phone app worked better"
"Often stops with a notification that title cannot be played. This occurs in the middle of a segment or show. The package for Hulu, Disney plus and ESPN would be good if there could be options. What if the family does not watch sports? Why not make an option to swap with HBO plus or Stars plus... I'm sure many customers could benefit from this. I haven't and has not watched ESPN once in the year that I've had the bundle. Seriously considering unbundling ( Also too many commercials)"
We have had this app for a long time now and haven't had any issues. Lots of good content and it is nice to be able to add/take off premium services at any time. The live tv option is great which we mainly use for football season. The ads can be a bit much but we DVR alot so it is no problem to skip. Only suggestion I have is in the DVR section I would like to see a list of upcoming recordings like the other cable services and be able to modify them as well. Otherwise I am happy with it.
"Very rarely crashes on any of my devices which is excellent. Some programs have an excessive amount of ads, and it'll be like 8 copies of the sane ad so every few minutes you get cut off to see the sane thing and it gets very annoying. I totally understand that hulu needs ad support to cover costs, I am cool with that, I just wish it was adjusted a bit better to be more tolerable."
"I love hulu live. This app is super easy to navigate, but I can't give that last star over for 2 reasons. 1. My content that I've watching is still showing as unwatched making it difficult to keep track and go straight to my latest episode. 2. There is STILL no way to make episodes, seasons, or shows as watched. With neither feature, it makes keeping track difficult. Once those issues are resolved, I'd be happy to release that final star!"
"App is fine for the most part, haven't noticed anything odd, everything seems to work as expected however the ""My Stuff"" section doesn't display everything that's actually in your list. Often I find myself needing to search up what I'm looking for to find that it says it's added but it doesn't show up. Minor problem but very tedious to deal with."
"Decent app, decent interface, decent selection. Ads are irritating, not because they are present (on the cheaper plan) but because certain shows will trigger an ad break after another ad break, or rewinding two seconds to the start of a scene after an ad break will re-trigger the ad break. Ads can run as long as 3 minutes, though the usual is 30-120 seconds."
"I've been using hulu for a while. Can't really think of ever having problems until using hulu on firestick. Now it crashes and lags and loads alot. I know it's the app because other apps like Netflix, YouTube, and HBO max don't have these issues at all on the same fire stick. Interestingly enough I Google the issue and many others have the same problem. Hopefully it's gets worked out soon so those of us using hulu on firestick can enjoy it more."
I like Hulu alot. It has alot of shows that I really like. I read some of the other people comments and I find that I have the same issue. That I will be watching a show and keeps stopping for 2 to 3 seconds and then plays again. Its very annoying. I thought it was because I've had my phone since 2020. I 'm trying to decide if should keep it or remove it off my phone. I won't pay for it if going to continue stopping and then starting again. I do really enjoy this app. Not sure what I will do.
"I will definitely change the rating to 5 stars when this bug is gone - at least i think its a bug, it happens when i watch Hulu on my ohone, or my xbox, or my moms tv. Its not that big, it's just the videos will kinda pause & lag for a second while its still playing, then pick back up where the audio is currently at, so it can skip a second or two of the film content being watched. Idk if others are experiencing it too, but it's been happening for maybe a few days now."
"Would give this 5 starts but with good reason.. I'm giving 4. The selection can be so vast yet nothing seems too promising, and usually isn't. Rotating the viewing selection and doing it frequently, could go a long way. Also lately anytime I'm watching on my smart tv, it freezes randomly no matter what I'm watching. No images but still has audio. I never used to have this problem until a few months ago. It's only on Hulu, none of my other streaming services. Otherwise love this service!!"
"A great app for watching TV shows! It has a great variety of programs at around $6, giving you lots of value! The only problem though is the price of live TV. It's really expensive! Also, why do shows expire? It's disappointing having to not watch a specific episode due to the expiration date, so I would suggest removing the expiration date just in case if you're late to watch an episode. Otherwise, awesome subscription service!"
"Great app but desperately needs to be fixed. Keep getting an error 2(-975) on my tablet which is preventing me from watching movies or shows that I actually want to watch. One of the suggested fixes is to try watching something else which normally works but to be honest, I don't feel like an app that I pay for should force me to watch something else before I can watch what I want to watch and if this continues for much longer I'll simply cancel my subscription. Not gonna pay for a service that doesn't function and works less effectively than the Crunchyroll app. I'll give you guys untill the end of the month to fix the problem, if it's not done by then I'll cancel and uninstall and you won't be getting a second chance."
"Usually has some pretty good content. Leans politically Left. Still classier than netflix. Seems to have more new/different content than amazon. also it doesn't seem like the offer one free season then try and charge you for the next. Which seams to be a bad habit of amazon. Its a great alternative to cable and for me it was much cheaper. With their live tv and flexible streaming, it has much more to offer than cable or satellite. I wish they had is a back button to change between 2 channels"
"I like Hulu 😍 it has plenty of different categories of entertainment, each program is more riveting than the last. I find a lot of English and British people who are actor's in the listings which does make it just a little more unappealing than usual. Other then that I find the commercial ads aren't overwhelming and easy to navigate, I'd definitely tell others to check it out! Thank you Hulu!!!"
"I love the app, I love all of the movies & shows. However I'm not sure if it's just mine but... every time I try to go back and re-watch a show, every other episode will start at the end instead of the beginning! I have to go back and click ""START FROM BEGINNING "" it's annoying when you're trying to actually binge the series/show."
Have only used hululive for a month. Pretty useful. Was a former regular hulu user. I used other streaming apps far more. Am not a big tv watcher. Even with the exclusive content. But I do enjoy football. I see there is far more college available. The UI will still take a little getting used to. I do enjoy the recording option.
"Finally cut cable! This is now my only source of television, and has been for the last 3 months. The only complaint I would say, is a lot of the time the app loses connectivity with my Chromecast (sorta). Like the icon is gone on my Note9+ but is still playing on my TV. I have to tell Google home to stop casting, to switch a program. Recently the app doesn't display ""play next episode"" correctly either. It gets stuck on the previous episode. After these are fixed I'll give 5 stars."
"Don't waste the money on the ad free experience. Everything has ads that are exempt from that experience. I watched an episode of chopped from 2010, commercials; it's just a bit ridiculous. Chatted with Hulu support and I'm always given the run around. Otherwise great service, lots of choices. Makes it easy to cut the cord."
"A great streaming service, equal to Netflix & Prime in terms of similar quality of Movies, Shows and Exclusive content. My 2 gripes are... 1. Some of the same exact content on all 3 of those platforms. 2. The search/category/library indexes needs some refinement. The layout is very short-handed per category. one other thing, dont use Hulu or other Stream services on the Nintendo Switch. After an hour there is 20-30 seconds of audio & video desynchronization."
"It would be the perfect experience if these things happened: Make a share button so i can send shows and episodes to people, make it to where i can skip to the next episode at the end of every episode instead of having to go back to the episode list everytime, and make the home screen more streamlined for mobile. There's barely anything going on the home screen."
"Pretty decent. Some of the layout is obnoxious and dumb, but it's got a good variety of shows. Good customization and lots of good shows and movies, but some things are ridiculous. I use hulu with ads, but a 35 second ad at the beginning of a show and a 90 second ad every 5-10 minutes is a little much. Why not a 90 second ad at the beginning and 30 second ads during the show? I feel like I've watched more ads than the actual show (not really). I know that's stupid, but it would be nice. 3.4/5."
"Although I liked the ap itself, I have cancelled my subscription for now. I prefer older, classic shows. Hulu doesn't have many of them any longer. You used to have a lot of them. They're almost all gone. I can get them on Amazon Prime, so I'm sticking with them. Never had any issues with the ap. Works great. For those ranting about the commercials, pay the extra couple bucks. It's worth it. No commercials at all."
"It's really good! I like how many shows they have. But the ads are too many. I would be watching more ads then the actually show. It's like every 10 minutes there's another 2 ads. So please either cut down on the ads,or just plain out remove them. Other than that, really good app I like it a lot."
A Glitch: can you guys PLEASE fix the audio between the ads and shows/movies. Once an advertisement pops up it's way louder than the show/movie I'm watching. I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem. i mostly watch hulu on both my tvs and my phone and it's always the same problem except when i plug in my earbuds to my phone the problem is suddenly gone. overall it's a great app i would recommend it.
"I just wish I had the option to set up a saved playlist for every day of the week. So u don't have to watch one show, then search for another. U can just press play once & the shows u chose play back to back. I don't always wanna binge the same show. I wanna set up like 4 sitcoms to watch while I get ready for work. It would be great if I could go to my morning playlist & the next episode from each show played one behind the other. I watch Hulu on tv btw. Just put it on my phone. Other than that, I love the shows, looks great."
Needs to work on the +10 second freezes (fixed). Also if a show ends and it shows .02 seconds of another show...can we please not add that to my continue watching list? Obviously I didn't want to watch if I didn't even watch it the opening credits. Also need a way to change the size of a movie to fit my screen on phone. New issue. The fast forward/rewind buttons don't load sometimes and have to back out of show completely to fix.
It can crash every now and then but overall its a solid app. It can be a little annoying to check messages because the screen orientation won't change from landscape if your viewing content. It is also easy to select something by accident when trying to go to full screen.
"Overall, excellent app... sans quality settings constantly reverting to AUTO when I always use LOW. I can see having to perhaps set it once for each show, but I'm having to change it back to LOW anytime I change shows, exit the app, etc. Its annoying having to stay on top of it to keep from killing my bandwidth allotments (plus the much slower load times on auto). To the devs: Pulllleeaaazzze add a GLOBAL BANDWIDTH SETTING that sticks where >> I << put it and that last star might just light up!"
"It's a very good app, easy to understand, but there is one thing lacking it hard getting rid of shows that you're no longer interested in watching. I dont like clutter and to see shows that I know longer watch still showing is annoying. Hulu design an easy way to release show we no longer watch or have changed our minds about watching."
"Expensive but good programming. The app works very well. If you think that ""cord cutting"" will save you money, you might want to compare prices with what you have and a comparable HULU plan. There's not much difference. Also, HULU uses a lot of bandwidth, so it uses more of your internet than a service such as Netflix would. All things considered, I like HULU. I would have given it five stars if it weren't so pricey."
"I wish all of the various shows that are available such as friends, monk, etc....had the option of showing all of the seasons like HBO and other channels do. I am a senior on disability and can't afford to buy other channels and it's difficult at times to catch the shows at the right time to record from s1, e1. Only some of your shows are set up that way"
"Usually this app runs fairly smooth, but the video has been lagging the past few days. Disney+ and ESPN+, I have no issue. But no matter what show I watch on Hulu, the video freezes briefly and the audio cuts out. It's only for half a second at a time, but it is consistent throughout every video I watch"
"I love this app. It's very affordable, even with the live TV option, which is what I have. The basic version of live TV provides everything I need. I typically watch football and some TV shows here and there. There are also plenty of extras to add in to better suit your individual needs. However, I am currently running it on a Samsung smart TV and it occasionally crashes. Not enough to be a real nuisance but its still there. Which explains why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
"I use an LG Stylo 6, i used to use a Samsung Galaxy A20, i no longer have the option to crop/zoom to fill my screen. I understand that my Stylo is somewhat disproportionate in screen length vs width and that alot of the content would be cut off but i would at least love the option to do so, Netflix allows me to do it. Other than that i have no complaints, the menus are great and easy to use and it has a huge selection of shows and movies. Ill give it a full 5 once i can crop like i used too!"
I love Hulu just dont care for all the other different shows at the bottom when I have the phone or tablet right side up. I hit them and change my episode to something else and it gets old changing it back and forth if I accidentally hit since my hands are a little big. Would just like the synopsis of the show at the bottom of the screen if that helps.
"Technically works fine, but doesn't support picture in picture. I've been spoiled by YouTube and Netflix letting me watch shows while doing other things on the same phone. The excuse ""can't do it because ads"" doesn't make sense because YouTube has ads, too, and they, unfortunately, run just fine in picture in picture. Seems that Hulu has just chosen to be inconvenient."
I love Hulu and the app... BUT for the fast forward options it would be nice to have a 30 or 1 minute fast forward option. I live in the middle of no where and my cell data is spotty at times so if I hit the fast forward of 10 seconds too much it glitches out. If it's a DVR'd show for live then we should have better/longer fast forward options.
"Love this app, love the easy ability to search and find idealistic options made for your own preference. I don't like having to keep pressing subtitles on for each individual movie or show, unlike on Amazon prime once you hit subtitles or captions on it stays on. And the ads are a little annoying but hey it's free. But for hulu costing get rid of the ads.."
"App is a little too sensitive, it can take me three or four tries to slide my options left or right, because if my finger drops a little, it'll slide the whole page down. And even though I've opted for the ad based version, I still see WAY too many ads. And it's the same ads over and over and over, Christmas and Thanksgiving were nightmares."
Hulu is my fav! I love that i don't need to have cable to watch all the latest shows that are on cable these days. My one and only complaint is the fact that there is no start over or play from the beginning button. That should be a standard function. When you fall asleep and miss 40 minutes of a show who wants to sit and rewind all the way to the beginning. I need that functionality added on the next update. Thanks!
"I love it so much better now. I dropped other pay channels because I can get all the shows here. I would like to see all seasons of Homeland.Iheart is one that should be on here. It is closer to cable prices now. I can't get some movies that are on Netflix that's OK. I am having some problems lately like mouth matching the sound very annoying and freezing and having to reboot Roku. That's why the 4 stars, please respond to people's reviews so we know you read them."
"I enjoy watching Hulu, I just have a couple issues or rather things that should be different/better. Biggest being, I pay for Netflix, Amazon, Disney+, and I don't have to pay 1 extra cent for no ads. That should be automatic, it seems like a very sleezy way of being greedy and making people pay more. Don't y'all already make enough money?? I'm sure yeah do with absolute certainty. If I wanted to watch ads or anyone for the matter, that's why there is TV/Cable."
Great app as far as streaming services go. I would say that this is not the service to use if you like movies since they don't have a great selection. The most annoying feature is that it doesn't always rember where you left off. It will show how much time is left when you are on the title screen for the show your watching but even though it shows that you have started it it will play it from the begining when you resume.
"We cut the cord almost 6 months ago and it has been amazing. Not only can i watch on my Tv via Roku, i can also watch on the go with my phone or laptop. I just have a few complaints. On mobile the screen is too sensitive. I'llI barely touch the screen and it starts skipping ahead. It would also be great if they would send notifications to tell you if theres new episodes available on a show. And PLEASE add picture in picture for Android. I wanna watch over other apps. Other than that 10/10"
"I believe that Hulu has a lot of good anime/animation, and some good films (They did recently add ""Parasite"" and ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire."") It's possible to watch the majority of their stuff on a $5.99 subscription without problems/ads. But compared to other streaming services, (*Netflix*) Hulu doesn't have many ""good"" films or tv shows unless you buy a channel. But the content that Hulu does have makes it a good streaming service overall."
I'm pretty happy with Hulu I've had a pretty good experience especially since they've put where you can minimize what you're watching while using your phone for other things... Another thing though that's annoying is that when you look up certain things on Google it says it's free on Hulu but then you look and it says it costs extra with that on they need to change that and make it very clear confusing.
"I have Hulu on my Firetv, while it has the occasional gem, Letterkenny is the main reason I will never cancel this service. Although I enjoy the content they offer (so many good titles), the service can be insanely frustrating. Instead of playing in succession from where you are, it might jump around to where you have possibly left off before, or in the middle of episodes you haven't finished. With all that in mind, absolutely worth paying a few dollars more a month to skip ads."
"Mostly positive experience with Hulu. Although when I signed up first with my free trial, I did no ads package. During the month I tried the free trial for Hulu Livebut ended up canceling before it renewed. After canceling Live,my free trial with no ads was changed to one with ads and they said nothing could change it.And, I wish Hulu would play on a smaller screen when you close out the app, like Netflix does so I don't have to stop what I watch if I need to quickly check something on my phone"
"After the latest update from 9/7/2022 the app seems to hesitate (lag) while watching shows every few seconds then plays for a few seconds then constantly repeats it. DO NOT update to this version. Clearing cache and data and or reinstalling does not help. I had to search for, download and install the Hulu 4.48 apx file (previous version) to get things back to normal."
"Items removed from my stuff still show in my stuff secondly there's no way to leave feedback for your app you should have a little icon in the sub menu somewhere to leave feedback for developers with diagnostic info. Something that could also be improved as an option to search for foreign films currently no way to filter foreign language films. Love the content app can use some improvement, runs well no bugs for the most part aside from my stuff just lacking a little bit in the search options."
"Hulu isn't that bad of an app, it's actually pretty good. The only minor things I would say, it doesn't have a _Lock Option_ for when you're watching content on the app & for some reason (on my using of this app) whenever I'm watching something & I tend to either rewind 10 seconds or whatever goes by & the screen always gets fuzzy, & it takes a while for the screen to come back on & sometimes it takes even much longer for the screen to load, but other than that, it's a great app."
"From cable to multiple streaming apps, I've tried several and haven't found a better option than Hulu for TV shows, sports, etc. It's very rare to search for a show and not have it available. For, $70 a month I would give Hulu 5 stars if the ad-free I pay for didn't have so many ads, and if the DVR would get an upgrade in quality and quantity. Hulu accounts have 6 profiles but only 50 total hours of shared recording time without paying an extra $10 on top of the premium service."
"Its pretty good, except it still makes me re-watch all the commercials if i have to rewind because i missed something. It's not nice. People are going to have to do that sometimes, or at least people who have trouble focusing. You really should make each commercial play once as long as the video is still in progress. There are still so many, it should be fine."
"Most of the tv shows I find interesting aren't available in English, although there are a few different animes that are but not many even though I can watch quite a few of the ones that only have sub version on other apps that just have ads and no required money. It would also be a nice possible addition to add a cast from phone to tv(mostly saying because of a rendering bug I experience from time to time when I leave my tv on the continue button and open it on my phone to walk away for a bit)."
Update to previous 1 star post. I was initially having issues getting the bundle features to work (ESPN+ and Disney+); after speaking with a very helpful customer service representative she explained the issue had to do with the fact that I was a previous Disney plus customer before the bundle was available etc. She provided some instructions which I followed and voila. Now everything is fine and I'm thoroughly enjoying the service. Although with Live TV it is equally as expensive as cable.
"Only real downside to this app is the limited library of shows and movies, and that there is no screen in picture option, meaning I cannot watch my show while doing anything else on my phone. Most other streaming apps offer this (Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube...) And I often get booted back to the start of my show when I minimize the app to check something else and then reopen it. However, the quality and price of the service and worth it for binging some older favorites."
"Overall I love this app! Hulu seems to keep their variety updated and more current than other similar apps. I also like that it is affordable. However, the one thing that I don't like about hulu is the amount of ads you have to watch. Yes, you can pay extra for no ads, but it's a little bit too pricey for me."
I like hulu and watch it a lot. The ads are annoying but they are annoying on cable too so that doesnt bother me so much. What does bother me is i turn the tv up while a show is on and when the ad comes on the volume is BLARING!!! So i turn the volume down but when my show comes in i cant hear it. Its the worst thing to have to keep turning the tv up and down up and down for eveey commercial.
"I love hulu, the only reasons for not giving it 5 stars is I have the live TV Disney+ ESPN+ bundle with no ads which is great and cheaper than cable in my area but I think there could be more of a selection in channels i.e. MTV now I get a large majority of channels do reruns and hulu serves as an on demand service but for new shows it feels like something is missing. Also I am a big fan of picture in picture mode in other apps and use it very often, there is a setting for it but doesn't work."
The Hulu app is cool. I use it in conjunction with other apps via the Firestick. I will say it sometimes freezes up and most of the time it's fine after a few seconds however I'm not sure if this is a result of the Firestick or the Hulu app? Also I've seen some loading issues with the guide but I know how to finesse it. I enjoy the app overall and it allows me the convenience of the programming I want when I want it and I would recommend everyone to give a try if you're looking to cut the cord.
"The app is amazing and the price is not bad at all, but there are way toomany ads. It would be fine if there was only one ad every 10 minutes. It gets annoying sometimes but overall very good and I wish there was a skip intro button because some intros are 1 minute or more long!"
"I gave Hulu 4 stars bc its not as user friendly as I would like it to be. First off I attempted to use a keyboard to navigate through the app on my Xbox one console and I'm able to get as far as selecting which user account profile to watch under. Once hulu loads I have no control whatsoever using the keyboard (up,down,left,right) arrows or enter,esc buttons. Once this issue is fixed I'll give 5 stars most definitely."
Edit: PiP was just added. Thank you! Good app. My only gripe is it's way too easy to accidentally touch and something and end up in another series and I just generally feel like there are more accidental jumping around when watching shows. A lock button would be excellent and make it easier to use episodes within a series instead of showing a YouTube style list of related shows.
"Love the app. But there's a few things... whenever I close the app, and begin using it again, it seems I always have to sign back in. Fixing this will create a better user experience. Logging in every time I use the app is ridiculous (i.e. favorite channels are held in the user profile, which means logging in every time to see them). It's a TV app, not a banking app. Plus sometimes I get the same 4-5 ads, alllll day. Once, I got the same back-to-back ad, four times in a row."
"Nice broad selection of channels, including a lot of classic TV and game shows that I really enjoy. Only knock is the occasionally glitchy playback, with some skipping around and dead air waiting for the next episode to start. The content is free, supported by advertising just like broadcast television, and I find myself using it quite a bit."
Love Pluto Television. This application is remarkable for streaming tv programs and movies! I have never had such a terrific experience with an app. The app is extremely user-friendly and I never ever need to bother with buffering. I always have my faves conserved so I can quickly see them without waiting. I highly suggest this application to anybody looking for a great way to enjoy tv shows and motion pictures.
"The UI makes you want to throw a rock at someone. It's frustrating. But I hope as the service matures, it'll improve. Aside that, it's a good streaming service. Depends on what kind of content interests you. But Pluto really does offer a wide range of programing from a sizable catalog. Roughly, content from between 1960-2017. Probably not many shows your specifically looking for, but enough good content, that'd I pay $5/mo to subscribe. The app streams solidly. No buffering or glitching issues."
"Most of the time it works ok, but occasionally lags out or restarts to an earlier spot, depending on your connection. Ads can be a bit long, but no worse than standard cable tv. Just wish they had more movies worth watching. Overall, it's a decent free TV & movie app."
For free TV it's pretty good. It has a ton of channels. It works really well on my phone and Vizio TV but the PS4 version lacks the Favorites option and the ability to log in. Also the app thinks I'm in another state for some reason and I didn't notice any way to change that. All in all it's a great app.
"GREAT APP! A must have for all devices! Like TV was meant to be, shows running in real time, at no cost, paid for by commercial breaks. SO glad I found this app. BUT HEY DEVS; At the bottom of the screen, after the ""search"" icon, can we PLEASE get a ""BACK"" button?!? (and in the lower left hand corner, in landscape mode)"
"Great app, but I have issues. I can't seem to log-in. My email & password are correct. Unable to customize etc. Any suggestions? Also, it would be nice to save what you're watching instead of hunting for it each time and saving movies for viewing later. **Update**- I've had this app for several months and now it constantly buffers. Every 3- 4 seconds. I'm uninstalling. I have a very reliable wi-fi connection. No reason for this. Do you have any suggestions for correcting this issue?"
"This is an awesome app! Very easy to use, with a nice variety and even though there are commercials, they are extremely short and not nearly as often as with regular television or YouTube which is refreshing. I would like to suggest to the developers to add english dubbed versions to the anime selection. Not everyone can or wants to read subtitles on a cell phone screen, also a search option would be helpful as well."
"Great app when you don't want to deal with cable or satellite tv companies. It's not perfect but I am loving it. I really like the scroll down guide,. Makes it so easy to quickly see what's on. I did notice you can't scroll out to see future episodes on the menu without it putting a screeching halt to whatever program you are watching, that's a bummer. Now we'll see how long apps like this remain free."
"FIVE STARS!...minus one for the commercial issues. More on that in a moment. There is some really good content. They even have Nickelodeon! Now the bad. The commercials are often horribly timed. The program may have a designated spot for a commercial, but they are often missed, or extras pop in with no warning at odd times. Then the commercials repeat. And repeat. Sometimes the same one plays multiple times in a row. Fortunately, they are usually short...but the sheer random timing is bad."
"I like it but just one minor problem, okay so before I get to the problem I wanna talk about the good. I really love the fact that its free, that there's no odds and ends just it being free as can be. Another thing is the shows and movie channels it has to offer, even though it's already chosen for you it's still a great selection to chose from. So now onto the bad, I dont like how the fact that when I favorited the shows I liked it didnt save them on the guide, hopefully it'll be fixed"
"Really really cool service. Love it. Seems to be missing some functionality that would be really simple and nice (hence my 4 stars rather than 5), such as being able to look through / search all the listings, being able to read the description of a program without necessarily changing to that channel just yet, and a ""last"" button to quickly flip back to the last channel you tuned into. Despite these lacks, it's incredible what you get, and for free. Love it."
"It's a great app, I've found a lot of good movies and shows on this. The reason I am giving it four stars is because 1) Sometimes it buffers, and then when it's fixed it will go ahead of the scene by a few seconds to a minute. And 2) On TV there should be a look up option and you won't watch a specific channel once it times out. Overall, it's great."
"I love using Pluto on my phone. I have a Roku that I also use this streaming channel on. The quality is pretty great. The streaming quality of the videos for specific devices as well as the varied content. Recently, there has been an issue where a show I am watching will freeze, but the audio doesn't and then it will repeat the same scene and lines once or twice. It happens nearly everyday. I would just like to see more Resident Kinevil frequently."
"Channel Guide needed on phone when casting! The app is great. Variety of shows. Some on demand. The only problem is that when I cast it to my tv, I can't easily channel surf. I can only go up and down by individual channels. It used to be that when casting, your phone would keep the same set up and you can scroll through the guide to pick channels. Bring that back! I want to surf during commercials - like go from 411 to 675 and back. Up & down channel buttons can't conveniently accomplish that"
"For what it is, it works awesome. Lots of shows and movies, both live and on demand. My only issue with it is the same ads over and over. Don't get me wrong, at first the ads were alright, kinda adds to the experience of TV watching, reminds me of cable. But then it became the same ads over and over, the same pattern, same intervals. The same GoodRx ad, same T-Mobile ad, then the Pluto ad, which I get in spanish for some reason(racist?), then the show starts again. A little variety is all I ask."
"Wide selection of movies, and it's free so a pretty good deal. However there are some problems. With free things come ads, which are understandable, but they come without warning during the worst timing. Also, whenever I open the app, it starts to constantly run shows or movies, which gets distracting. Other than that, I do recommend it."
"Pluto.tv is awesome. Yes there are ads but there's a lot of channels and it's all free, what do you expect? Why not 5 stars? The hide channel and favorite functions don't work at all. It's seems to let you choose but when you go back to the guide, the channels that have been marked as hidden are still visible and I can't find where to access the channels that I have marked as favorites."
Love this app. Totally free (I wonder for how long). My only complaint is that when casting to my TV via chromecast it buffers WAY too much. I don't have this issue with any other app that I stream with so it's not my internet. The only other thing about which I find a little odd is their commercial placement. They will start while someone is mid sentence. They pick up where it got cut off it just seems like an odd thing to do rather than put them where they were when originally aired.
"Great interface, sometimes glitchy, but FREE. I really like this app, the interface, and the programs. I dont even really mind that the ads come at weird times, because its free. The only thing that really bugs me is when it will randomly skip back several minutes or more in a show. Then you have to rewatch lengthy segments youve already seen. then sometimes it skips back to real time."
"It's a great app, I really like the various movie and tv options. Alot of good things are available! The help/support page is really good too. However, the one thing that messes up and largely since I wasn't able to find a solution. Is the on-demand feature, wasn't able to connect to it. The live-tv works good, sometimes have to disconnect my wifi to view though."
"I usually love this for holiday music and scenes to fall asleep with, but maybe with the latest update, the music as been buggy. The time bar keeps going back and forth, like it's trying to get a signal. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it. It does work some of the time. So yay! I usually have to exit out and then open it again. It may work from now on. Thanks for getting back to me! I'm enjoying my crackling fire background and soft holiday music while I relax!"
"The app was better than I thought when I used it and I do like I can watch classic shows and even some new ones. A few things that can be added is a favorite feature to mark movies, channels and shows. One more thing is that the app doesn't get along with VPN networks like Express, but I got around it by turning it off and then it works again which is kinda weird, but hopefully it can be fixed somewhere down the line."
I'm liking the improved interface so far. Everything's organized by category so you can easily find what you're looking for. The live section almost looks like a complete cable guide now. One feature that I'll request to be added is for each channel's show or movie schedule to be extended one to three days ahead of time instead of the next hour or two that we have now. Edit: The mini background viewer window is gone?! Why not add that back as a option for others to toggle on or off instead?
"PlutoTV has a lot of great content, and even has a whole channel devoted to one of my favorite shows, MST3k. The Android app has one significant quirk though: the channel list and ability to log-in can only be accessed in portrait mode. This confused me for quite awhile on my tablet, because I have it attached to a keyboard case and basically always use it in landscape mode. Other than that, it's great, and it's free!"
"This is a great app. It offers good shows, some live news and programs, and good movies, with fewer ads than most Free TV apps I've tried. If it offered a little better live weather coverage for hurricane season, I would not need Cable TV at all. (I live in a hurricane prone area on the Gulf Coast.) A search feature is really needed, though."
This is exactly what I've needed! I only have an antenna on my roof so the cable stations are the best thing EVER! I work at night and miss a lot of my fav shows and can see them here. The commercials aren't anything more than I'd see if I had cable or satellite and it's all free! I agree with another reviewer...the only thing that this app needs to make it perfect is a search bar so I can look for a particular show or movie without scrolling through all the listings every time.
"Nice to watch stuff for free, dont even mind the ads most of the time. However two problems I ran into. I would really love a search function in the movies and tv section. I've been digging through all the titles looking for one movie I saw before but can't find it again. Second my movie did not resume where I left off, 45 minutes in. I tried manually skipping to the place I was before, but it stopped me at /each and every last ad break I had already seen./ Very annoying."
"Great app, I've been using this for months now. It shows free tv shows and movies and has 2 or 3 ads in the middle of the show or movie which im fine with. It functions well and its easy to use and its cool. The only problem I have is that, sometimes parts of the shows, the subtitles doesn't show at the right time when the characters are talking and subtitles shows seconds later. But it fixes it like in the half of the video."
"First day, but so far it works the way I need it too. It doesn't seem to have full integration with chrome cast. Volume has to be specified and doesn't become default when casting. I'm assuming that having to back out of what you are playing to browse other content has to do with the live streaming. I assume this will be corrected in some future version. Let's not forget that you can't beat the subscription fee which is free."
"I love this app. Great range of news stations and variety of movies and shows. The only thing keeping me from giving a resounding five stars. I can't ""search"" the movies & shows section. Grrrr. I will see shows I want to watch later, but can't remember the section I saw them listed. I have to plow through each and every section trying to find one show. And often can't find it. Doesn't bother me if it has been removed. But when I know it is there and I just can't find it!! Oh for a ""search"" opt!"
"The live TV is great for just sitting at home or for casual viewing if you're busy, but it has as many commercials as cable. That being said, it IS free. The 'On demand' tab offers more consistent viewing with a little less ads, which is nice, but it NEEDS a search bar. It has a lot of great shows, but you can't find half them you want to go back to because you forgot if it was under one category or another. 4/5, it's better than cable, would be better than Netflix if it had a search bar."
"I get it...PlutoTv is free, but your program editors need to fine tune their skills a little bit. It's bad enough that you have commercials abruptly interrupt tv shows (of which, by the way, kudos on the main use of PlutoTv as an advertising platform), but commercials cutting into other commercials is a bit too far. But, yeah, I get it...it's free."
"Ok, this app is excellent but there are a few rather serious flaws about it. First and the most glaring is the fact that it keeps freezing up and not responding. The second is not quite as serious as the first but it every bit as annoying, when you hide a channel please actually hide the channels I don't wish to see on my programming list! But otherwise it's a good app!"
"Great service with still some room for improvement. Note: this is a review update. I added a couple stars to my previous review on account several issues were addressed. Thank you, PlutoTV for finally adding a search option. Also, some previously broken links seem to be fixed. The preview window still impedes searching. An option to hide it would be nice. Lastly, some of the ads feature some really nutty right-wing extremist content. I wish had a means of opting for alternative ad content."
"Really good for free TV. I watch probably 3 channels mostly. Voyage & Conspiracy are my two Favs though. I will say this though over all it is OK but it does needsl work on ""ease of use"". A last channel watched button to flip between two channels would be nice. The guide & channels on Roku is not a lot of fun, there csn be a lot of scrolling when going from one end of the line up to the other. In other words, there's no shortcuts. Commercials are shown much more often than before, too."
"For the most part I really like Pluto. I only have a small complaint. It seems the favorites don't save from the last time I used the mobile app. If I go the edit channels, I will see all the channels I marked as favorites but when I want to only see my favorites in the guide, I have to mark them as favorites again. There's also no way to only see my favorites in Roku but that's another complaint for another device. Also it would be nice if there was a last channel feature so I can flip back and forth. That might be a bit much to ask for so I'm not judging based on that. It's just a suggestion. Overall I really like Pluto and have already recommend it to friends."
"I love the selection but there are so many commercials. I understand this and don't begrudge you this. I know you need to pay for your service somehow, but couldn't you play them in the show's original commercial breaks? One other thing though; sometimes, if I paused the playback, when I restarted it the playback would jump back to previous scenes instead of where it was paused. Sometimes it would jump all the way back to the beginning."
"Better in every way than Netflix, especially the selection for live channels. I don't mind the commercials (there's really many commercial breaks and when there are there aren't many) the commercials however are about places/things that aren't in my area, I like that you're able to keep the show on and playing while you surf the web during commercial breaks. The ONLY reason I give it 4 stars is because it freezes, goes black and you have to reload it A LOT. And the selection for on demand sucks."
"There are a variety of Channels to choose from. I'm a bit of a News junkie, and that's my biggest dissapointment is that most of the News just reruns video. It would be nice to have one or two that are Live. Also the guide and the program that does show / movie info needs a lot more info and the guide only shows a very limited time. It only goes forward about 2 hours, so if you're like me, I like to know what is on later so I can plan things. Not with this app. Good app, just needs improvement."
"I got rid of cable. The cost kept gg up. This is the first time having TV again and I missed it more than I thought I would. Only two issues: (1) It doesn't say how to access movie details. I saw it once so I know it's there. I want to see a brief movie description and who's in it!!! It's like being lost in the dark!! NOT good. (2) NOW I remember the other reason for discontinuing cable.. I get all involved and my to-do lists are a joke!! Otherwise, I'm cool."
"I'm very impressed with all the content on here. Could there be more? Of course, and I understand they are adding more all the time. My only complaint, so far, is the lack of a search function and queue or a workable favorites section. I use both the android app and on my Firestick and the favorites function doesn't work on either."
"Lots of choices for viewing and music. Some binge channels get repetitive quick. Can watch stuff that hasn't been on air for quite a while. Huge variety to choose from. And, FREE. Love the app - great quality pic, works well for watching movies. Love that, if you miss a beginning or have to stop watching, you can switch over to ""movies and tv"" and find what you were watching ""on-demand."" And the fireplace with Christmas music. And holiday romance movies on Mistletoe. The list goes on! 💕"
"Love that I can watch practically any tv show and movie for free, even with the fact that you have to watch what is ""Now playing"". My only complaint is that the hide channels feature doesnt seem to work. I've taken the time to hide all the channels i know ill never watch, but when i go in to my guide, they are all still there, making my guide very cumbersome and time consuming to navigate. Please fix this issue so that I can get to my favorite channels and shows quicker."
"This app is for those who want to break free from the high cost of cable and satellite. Though much of the programming is dated, there is a massive amount of quality content both live and on demand. Ads are non intrusive as well. There is one bug, however. I created a list of favorite channels and exited the app. Upon return, they were no longer under that section even though I have an account. I attempted to add again but the same thing occurred. Please fix in a future update!"
It's a good app although it doesn't have regular channels. You can still find shows that are like some of them. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because on some shows it repeats a little part of the show and it keeps doing it randomly at different parts. It seems like it rewinds for 5 seconds and repeats that part whenever it likes.
"Everything about Pluto is awesome, EXCEPT, the ads. I don't mind ads for a free service, but the repetition of these ads are ridiculous. Please either bring on new advertisers, or even offer a cheap subscription service to eliminate ads. Honestly, I think I know more about Asheville NC than I do about my own home town thanks to seeing the ad hundreds of times per week. That's just one example. Overall, it's has great movie, TV and On Demand selections. I recommend it. 💯"
Other than the occasional(rare) issue with connectivity I've had no negative experiences. Plenty of variety to satisfy most enthusiasts. I get the technical limitations. Wish there was a last channel button. The constant scrolling gets tiresome. other than that great choice in programming. Keep up the good work.
"While this app is great, especially with the newly added picture in picture option, some features really need to be fixed. 1. When I favorite a channel, it doesn't stay favorited after I close and open the app. 2. Edit channel function doesn't even work, I hid some channels and it still showed in my channel list. If they fixed those things, then it would get a full 5 stars"
"I am really enjoying my experience with Pluto TV. My only concerns are that the app loads slowly, even on great reception and there is no way to adjust the data usage (it uses a lot). Dear Pluto developers, please make it accessible to us users to be able to toggle the amount of data used (high, medium, low, etc). Overall, I like Pluto's interface and their selection. I always tell my friends about it and I'm especially grateful for it now."
"It works well. Some of the channels are so heavily saturated with commercials I just turn the app off. Watched a Steve Martin movie for two minutes and commercials started playing one after another, I kept thinking this has to be the last one. They went on and on and on and on and on. I shut the app off and looked out the window to watch the grass grow. Preferable to 10 to 15 minutes of commercials to watch 4 minutes of movie. I haven't turned the app on for a week now. Life is to short."
"I'm loving the updates! Way better than what it used to be. As a truck driver, this is like always having regular TV available, especially the news and weather channels. I see people complain about the layout and function, but I think that's all on purpose! It looks vintage to go along with the programming. Only gripe would be the variety of commercials, lol!"
"This app is great for catching up on previous episodes and live TV. My complaint is that while watching the episode, it will revert back to the beginning of the episode or commercials start in the middle of random parts of the episode. Happens more times than not and it's annoying because you can't jump back to where you were in the episode. The app needs some work on several issues."
"I haven't had access to television for years and years. I'm amazed at how much this resembles regular TV. You can browse the channels and schedules, which imitates the feel of TV. The variety of content is quite amazing. The quality is topnotch, also. The only con is that sometimes ads repeat frequently, ranging from every six minutes, to every twelve minutes."
"Good app so far but last update the ""picture-in-picture"" stopped working. I don't know if it was just the update but in the setting on here it is turned on. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it a few times and it still won't let me use that option. The picture-in-picture is useful when I want to at least listen but need to check on important emails from work or such. Other that that I like Pluto TV a lot so far."
"I love it I've been using it for a bit of a year. Just shy of 2. I always thought there should be a flashback button, the ability to input channel numbers, and the option to arrange the favorite channels and the order I saved them should be synced for redownloading to other devices. That's all that I have to recall right now."
"Great app but I think this needs a search bar for movies. It also sends me to the beginning of the movie several times, and when I try to skip back I have to watch 3 ads for each fraction of the movie. Aside from all of this, I think that this app has many great movies that I never would have seen without it."
"Good app with personalized features. Can sync between TV, tablet and phone. The thing is, it's not user friendly with clear tabs that allow you to click on your favorites especially for a non smart TV. And each item setup or appearance is very different. If I wasn't so bored in isolation I'd give this app 3 stars, but for now I'm reasonably entertained."
"Great app! I enjoy the selection of live and on demand programming, and the amount of commercials keeps it familiar but at the same time not enough to feel intrusive. The only issue at the moment is that since the last update I have noticed some glitches like after the end commercials player gets hung up on The pluto screen saver , and sometimes doesn't recover without restarting the app. I realize the app is free , but it would be perfect if the glitches were taken care of."
"It's a really good app. There are a lot of variety in the type of programming from satellite shows to internet broadcasts. Although, there are some programming that seems kind of unnecessary; like entire channels that focus on one show. Overall, good app that's well worth the download."
Good app for free TV shows and movies. Very wide selection of TV shows and movies (slightly older). Live TV and movies (especially movies) can get very repetitive (same movies over and over and very slow to cycle to different ones) but the on demand feature allows you to get away from seeing same things over and over. Has quite a few commercials but still find that I use this app more than Netflix.
"The app is not perfect. However, I have many regrets for not opening this app sooner. Pluto TV is an amazing service. It's like cable TV with all the commercials; best of all it's free. This app has minor lag/buffer issues, but it's not too bad. I love the PIP feature; I can watch while typing this review. Overall, great service but the app needs a little bit of work."
I love the variety of channels and the continuous new additions offered for a free service. I can also star my favorite channels like Star Trek! I had some connectivity issues initially but they have resolved. I also experienced a problem when it wouldn't connect on my phone but fine on my laptop. I reset my router and the mobile app worked fine again. It's my new TV go-to.
"I have to say that, compared to broadcast tv, Pluto is heavy on the ads. It does have a great variety of channels. There is a channel for Julia Child, Bob Ross, and an assortment of old shows and movies --which run on a loop. Meaning that you'd get tired of watching one channel after a while. Chromecast is a little finicky to work with, but that's been my experience with a lot of applications. So I can't fault it too badly as that might be a result from a larger issue."
"It's a reasonably good concept and makes me think that had slightly better technology in the 1990s, this would more or less have been the layout for basic cable. I would love to see a version of MTV Classic become available now that Viacom is heavily invested. The main reason it only gets 4 stars is there may be dozens of channels, but most are junk. There does seem to be something worth watching though."
"Anyone else having trouble opening the app? It freezes up for me on the home screen (""Pluto TV: Tune in, it's free""[?]), and never actually loads anymore. This is after working great for months. And for some reason, Google play store won't let me update. I hit the ""update"" button, and it just buffers for a second and then says ""installed"". What's up with this?"
"I have had this app plus 5 other free tv apps, Netflix & hulu on my two roku TV's, tablet & phone. By far, I use this one most. Issues: 1. Once in a while (once a week, maybe) it will close itself, I just open it back up, no problem. 2. A few months ago it wouldn't exit a program properly or resume play, I'd have to start over, very irritating. So I Googled the issue & found a fix. Has lots of seletions, On Demand, watchlist... I recommend giving it a try"
"Great app for tv but disorganized. 5 stars on watching tv the old-school way. From movies to programs...lots of great choices! HOWEVER - you can't search alphabetically, listings are not necessarily logical, way too many ads, app freezes often, many live shows are not available on demand, and my tv app is totally different from my phone app (which is the better of the two). So, it's a 1 on the app itself.... I rounded up to a 4, bc with a bit more redesigning, it'll get there."
After not having cable in nearly a decade this is definitely a reminder - there were only select channels I actually enjoyed. But this is free! A few items for me 1. My favorites never seem to save after the app is reopened. 2. I'd like it if the ads were synced a bit more to the break in programming. Thoroughly entertained by mst3k and rifftrax channels alone. And NFL TV.
"Generally good but Chromecast problems, constant buffering even on pretty fast (6-8Mbs) connections no matter what wi-fi video quality you select in the app. Not all Chromecast controls are available in app, no volume control or timeline so I have to access that in the Google home app. Resuming a show also never seems to work, it always starts from the begining no matter what I set. The app works great on all of my other devices, just not from casting from the phone, really good content too."
This app is awesome but it has some issues. It frequently freezes while chromecasting. I have to reboot my phone and Chromecast. If you are watching an on demand movie and miss a scene you are out of luck. You have to start at the beggining rewatching EVERY commercial in the movie while fast forwarding. If they made it possible to forward and reverse stopping halfway between the commercial breaks they could still stop people from skipping commercials while making the app more user- friendly.
"This might be my favorite free tv app. They have a huge variety of the shows and channels i love in their ""live"" section, and a super on-demand library of tv shows and movies. I did not give 5 stars because there are a few essential features missing: 1. A search feature! Come on, this is neccessary! 2. Ability to indicate favorite shows and channels. 3. Add more then a few hours ahead on the viewing guide. I have other suggestions like adding much more info about a movie or show (date, actors..)"
I really love the app. I think over all it is very user friendly and runs very well. I think it would improve overall experience of you would add a serch bar though. (there might already be one and I am just over looking it) Also you might consider throwing in a few app ads instead of the Pluto loading screen? It's easy to get annoyed and it makes the ads seem longer with nothing to watch
Great if You Like Classic TV. Lots of old tv and movies. The app itself needs some upgrades which Pluto says are coming (please Pluto we need a search option. There's so much content it's hard to find stuff). You can't pause rewind or DVR live TV although you can pause and rewind in the On Demand section. If you want that stuff you need one of the paid streaming services. But hey this one is free. For a free app with a lot of content it's good. I'm keeping it.
"Pretty solid free tv app. The thing that sets this app apart from other free tv options out there is the front end has a familar interface that people are used to. Very clever. I'm sure that Comcast, Time Warner and Direct TV are thrilled by apps like this that mimic their look and feel and cost nothing. There are adds of course but so far the adds are not any more obtrusive than with normal tv. For what it is i give it a solid 4\5 to get a perfect score there needs to be a way to get local tv"
"This is a wonderful app. So many channels to choose from. Two issues I have are 1: there seems to be a commercial break every two minutes. I consider this to be minor because it's free and they have to pay for it somehow. 2: The majority of the commercials are politically motivated and pushing an agenda. I truely wish there were more ""generic"" commercials. All in all it is terrific."
Was pretty good until the last update. Can't make it go into the mini screen anymore so I can flip through other apps at the same time. Resets so when I leave the app for a minute I have to go back and find the channel over and over. Yet to figure out how to just make a favorite channel list if that even exists. Other than that if it's free it's for me.
"I love that its free but everything is reruns constantly. The other thing i really dislike is if I'm watching a movie it wants me to add the channel to my favorites and if it's not a favorite channel it doesn't matter because it asks every 5 minutes until you make it a favorite. It does take up the whole bottom of tbe picture and the right hand corner which does block what you are watching. Can you add a search bar for the on demand? You can't search easily, so it takes forever to what you want."
"I have the same issue another reviewer mentioned. The app was working great on my Roku until around the beginning of November 2020, and now it gets stuck on one channel. The only fix is to reinstall the app, but this is only temporary. By the the next day, it gets stuck again. PLEASE FIX THE ROKU APP!!! Edit: Finally, the Roku app was fixed. Back to 4 stars."
Overall great app. It's constantly growing getting better and better to me. I would like to see the favorites list work on Roku and Chromecast but not a deal breaker. It wants to freeze periodically then starts again (which could be my chrome cast as I've noticed it rarely of ever does it on our Roku. I would highly recommend. Wished they could offer local channels for a small fee.
"I really enjoy the app, lots of great content. I had to turn off the notifications however, because they are completely annoying. I could not care less about the political nonsense they keep pushing on the notifications. Also, the in house commercial for the SeeBS news are nauseating. If there was a way to not have those that would be great. This knocks it down to four stars."
"App is good if you like free. Just wish there's a way to up grade. All the commercials. At least for the movie section, that where there shouldn't be any commercials. How can I upgrade? All other channels are good. Since the update yesterday (1/6/19) I think it's been having issues getting a signal. I'd hate to uninstall. Maybe it needs another update? UPDATE: MTV video channel not working!(6/30/19)and it keeps pausing no matter what channel I have it on. Going to try Stirr TV"
"Great Free TV/On-Demand App. I like the new updates. I get a lot of use out of this app. Although, i have request; to REMOVE the small RESET BUTTON in the middle of the screen when a movie is playing. It looks almost exactly like the ""Rewind 15 sec"" button at the bottom of the screen. I often find myslef mistakingly restarting the whole movie when i just want to go back a few seconds, ruining my session. Fixing that would be MUCH APPRECIATED (Like ""5 star"" appreciated). Thank you. -AB"
"This is truly a wonderful app! It works great on my phone and TV but I'm having major issues with it on my computer. If I just watch it without downloading the app, I get no sound on live TV, only if I play on demand. If I download the app for windows 10, it will play for a while with sound, then freezes with a black screen. I close the app, then open it again, but the black screen remains. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it. I have done this several times and it keeps doing the same."
"Can't complain about free content even if it's from Ziocom. I do want to be able to pause, record, rewind, etc. Also, put the channel logos on the actual channels. It feels like the 20th century without channel bugs on the bottom of the screen. (One more thing, your X1 app is very slow and clunky.)"
"My last review was less than stellar, but the fact that they have since addressed my biggest issues has led me to upgrade to a 4. I still don't like the ads being so one-sided and biased, but I can ignore them. I have to update my watch list again, but I can now access it, and I can watch my On-Demand TV shows straight through without it stopping after every episode."
"I use this app very often and love watching mostly on Gordon Ramsey's shows too! Personally I would put 5 stars...because it works well for my tablet, but... it doesn't work on my TV, I don't know what went wrong...Pluto TV kept kicking me out of screen inside my TV...please help me fix it or communicate with me at least to get it fixed then i can change rate to 5 stars. Thank you!"
"Pretty entertaining app with great content, but please bring back the minimized screen option! With the new update, the feature is gone and it's a great feature to have when you wanna be multitasking on your phone. Now I use Netflix more often because it has the feature and allows me to be entertained while doing tasks on my phone."
We have this app on all the TVs and phones. We absolutely love this app and all the new channels you keep adding. The only down fall I have with this app is the fact it will be running fine and then just stop and start buffering. I find it does it more often on the tv version then on the phones. But on the same note its frustration all the same.
"This is a good app. I'm a movie watcher. There is an advantage and disadvantage to this app I noticed. The advantage of this app is you will find movies you won't on the other apps, like Roku and Tubi. And this app tends to take forever to load and very slow running. It sometimes gets glitchy when you look at the available movies. When you play the one you want, it always plays that next one on the list. Then, you have to hit the movie before the one you want to watch and watch it like that."
"I have an Android phone and so far the app works fine. I'd give it 5 stars if I could watch a movie without the massive amounts of commercial breaks...far too many considering the commercials are promoting mostly other Pluto TV channels. Seeing as I can already view those channels on the app, may I suggest limiting the commercial breaks to products that actually pay for the programming? It's really difficult to follow a movie plot that gets interrupted LITERALLY every other minute."
"Favorites still need a feature to manually reorder them (dragging with your finger would be nice). Still needs option to expand/fill longer screens like Pixel XL series, especially with older 4:3 SD content similar to the iPad version. I'm willing to increase my rating as these features are added. However, the ads have gotten way out of control over the past year. They insert them in the middle of dramatic scenes that completely destroy the movies."
"This app is almost perfect. It lacks a search option in the tv/movie section. I have trouble with the favorites in the live tv section not saving after logged out. Also, watching live tv just today, my two favorites I chose, so I can flip easily between them, both randomly became unchecked as favorites. Would like to have app available on Xbox. Other than these issues, the channel selection on live tv and the movie/tv selection is relatively decent."
"Works, but across all devices it stutters after a while. The stutter is very odd, it's like it jumps back in time a second, reiterating the last second or so. Bandwidth is not the issue. A restart fixes it for a bit. Another complaint: There does not seem to be a search feature anywhere."
"I've been using the app for awhile. It's ok for free tv. It offers a lot of free channels, has a movie and TV shows section. What I don't like is that when you favorite channels it's not permanent. When you close the app and open again, your favorites are gone. Please make it where your favorites stay permanently, so you won't have to favorite channels every time you open the app. That's a hassle. Will give 5 stars if developers could make this happen."
"I see everyone is experiencing the same wacky playback issues I am having on a different device. This device won't even open the app in it's current configuration, let alone allow me to update it. But hey it's free right? And i'm really only here to recognize the propaganda, see what they are and have been trying to indoctrinate people with and point it out to whomever is interested in knowing. I request a fix for the player issues to make that more streamlined please. Research mudfloods"
"it's cool cause it's free BUT- the random commercials often in Spanish- huh?, and you can't see what a show/movie is about unless you turn to it- what?, and you can't read ALL of the description...I usually have to Google it to get a full description, AND saving FAVORITE channels are a waste... they don't save. On the mobile app (Samsung galaxy S8) OR the app on my Roku. The movies on demand section is cool. I think I'll check out Crackle... can't be worse."
"The only flaws I continue to see are the ad placements (middle of a scene or word) and favorites aren't staying. I downloaded on my phone to get the edit channels back I had a few years ago on my Roku. I have quite a few favorited but no 'favorites' category shows up; unless I select (or reselect) the channel from the guide. Not all stations are showing in ""edit"" for example the Viacom ones. When I leave the app all my favorites vanish as well."
"I love the app but I wish it had auto play on shows, it's so hard keeping up with what episode and season your on and if you click the wrong episode it takes you all the way back to the beginning of finding the season then episodeall over. I also wish it saved recently watched movies and shows so you could find things easier. It does have a lot of commercials but a little bit less than tv. It has a great show, movie and channel selection but it needs a search bar."
"I wish it was easier to update the movie players better. It plays it good for a certain amounts of time, then it gets hard to play the movies. Just wish that there was an easier tutorial to updating it and maintaining the applications. Besides those problems, its an awesome app to have when on a low budget, when it comes to watching movies and/or tv shows."
"love it when it works. sometimes the add-ons disappear and i have to redownload a build. it's not too complicated because i have a kodi configurator but it can be frustrating. it also takes a LOT of room to install the app and the build that makes it work. otherwise, great app. i tell all my friends about it. if these few small issues could somehow be remedied, I'd give 5 stars in a heartbeat but they are not serious enough to make the app an uninstall."
"Excellent application for Kodi individuals! I was hesitant initially because I didn't know if it was gon na be legit, but it is! I was able to mount a bunch of plugins as well as addons as well as it functions perfectly! Extremely suggest!"
Great app. Would be five if it natively supposed pasting text into the fields. Bit of a misstep for a highly configurable app.
Revised from 2017. Working a lot better since then but still very reliant on the outside sources to be maintained worth downloading and installing the add ons.
After a few months the mouse stops working and the only way to fix it is to uninstall and re install and that destroys all library info. The backup utility is useless becaus it is not backward compatible from version to version!
Perfect but it says try to update after developer fix bugs..other than that I hope it works good.. I give 4 stars..
"I have been very happy with 17.6 which was doing fine playing 4K movies on SHIELD. But 18 has totally messed this up, have to put in a whitelist 4k resolution as only 1080p resolution can be set up, and still there are colouring issues.  Well I have to switched to VLC instead.  A total clean install with 18.2 seems to have fixed the issue. Now happy again, but do not allow automatic update anymore."
Great job. Please add ability to get location permissions so I can maybe view drm content from the hdhomerun pvr client.
For the rest its a good app but maybe add a casting option instead of screen casting
"Despite the issue with version 20, which could not read files unless a workaround, some aspects of Kodi have improved, but the application crashes quite often on the Nvidia shield."
just downloaded it for my nvidia shield.At first nothing work but consulted the kodi forums i found out that i have change some setting on my device and in kodi to get my videos to play and my addons to work. There some some minor glitches but nothing that would stop me from using the app.
Dts and truehd audio codec not supported with allow pass through option please reply the solution
Not had this long enough to give it a really thorough review but so far it does serve my purposes. I do have some niggles with it that I am sure will be addressed in later updates such as it doesn't seem to run when I have my phone screen refresh rate set at 120hz meaning I have to change my display and set it to 60hz before use. The second issue is finding network storage is as some describe a little difficult and seems to be an issue with this version. All in all though it works for me!
"A lot slower than it used to be. I've had this app on my Shield TV (Android TV) since I got it (IIRC it was v15). Everything that should be there is present, but its got a lot slower at scanning since v18, It used to take about 15 secs to scan my NAS shares and STB for new content but since installing this it takes around 45 secs, and is apt to crash if I try to play content while its scanning. I've got other version on laptops, tablets and rasb pis (2B & 3B), but none of them are this slow."
Good experience but in this aap setup is not easy to install due to some difficulties
"I like the app, the only issue i have with it is each of my anime/tv series folders on my drive has an individual image for it, when i started up my old 4k box, it should show the image instead of a blank folder icon. This app shows folders list, no icons. The only way to get the image as the folder is to access my drive threw the ""pictures"" part of the app. I really wish it was like that with the Movies/Tv part of the app. Looks so much nicer seeing all the different icons"
"Works OK but it doesn't stream video when phone is connected to TV so... It's only on the go. No complaints, it's free but I was hoping I could stream to big screen. Everything else seems to work nice and smooth. Thanks."
"To avoid a black screen+autoclose at app-start , you should exit the program always with the powerbutton on the app's homescreen and then 'exit'. To fix a black screen at startup, go to settings-apps, force-close the app and delete its cache. Cheers!"
Great app. Only thing I'd suggest adding to this Android version is the ability for the video to keep playing when it's not the active window. That way you can use Androids split screen view (two apps on screen at the same time using half screen each) and do other things like browse the web while watching a video. If devs or anyone reads this please consider adding this.
"Looks pretty neat. Can be confusing at times. If this is like the kodi for raspberry pi, i can probably expect to struggle to use youtube on it. As it was really complicated to get it working on the pi. It needs your own api key which the instructions on how to make one is very long. I once got south park to partly work on it. Like it would play up to around 10 minutes of it until it just stops working. Gave up on it. I love and hate the UI. It looks so well made but feel like a lot is missing."
"Oh boy, where to begin. This software has issues, it's good but still has issues. Scanning for new movies fails recent, SD movies won't play properly without turning off HW acceleration, HD movies won't play properly without HW acceleration. I've been going for a new release but the last release was a year ago. Newer version seem to be buggier than the older ones, which is a real shame."
"I previous rated it with 1 star, due to horrible problems with v18 overwriting the v17 configuration. With the latest and greatest version, Kodi's back to its' previously solid performance. Very good for organizing large video (and audio) libraries. Good search/sort features, and playback handles everything. When watching foreign videos, you can download subtitles, which has been a lifesafer on occasion. Recommended."
"Simple, this app was made to be customized. That unfortunately comes at the cost of usability, but with enough efforts, anything is possible. Just... don't use it to pirate stuff. That type of use is not supported by the developpers, because it's illigal. Plus, you need to have third party application to do that, so if you complain that it is too complicated, you are probably trying to install a third party addon. The only real problem is the keyboard. Overall, great, powerfull app."
I find it difficult to set up and confidently configure. There are some UTube instructions clips that help a bit with it. Id love it to come with a full guide to set up and be sure not to cause problems on devices.It definitely is highly popular with those who understand how to fully use it
"It Displays our content well , but it is not able to play .mkv format files. It tries to open it but when it plays the content only audio is audible and not video. After somes time the video crashes and it stops working. Hoping Developer's will fix this issue as soon as possible."
Good enough for playing songs from my Windows PC over SMB. The GUI is not intuitive. Takes time to understand. The music player can suddenly stop in the middle of a song for some seconds a jump to next one.
"Update: (Oct. 2022). Samsung users: Settings > Display > Motion Smoothness > Standard (60hz). That fixes the issue. Kodi screen refresh rate maxes out at 60hz, whereas newer phones have a max refresh rate of 120hz, which renders the app incompatible. Simply toggle that feature off in settings and close/reopen the app No longer working since switched phone from S9 to S22 Ultra. Black screen upon app opening. Uninstalled and re-installed. Issue remains. Please fix so I can update app rating."
"Incredible software for playing and managing video collections like movies, tv, etc. Unfortunately due to Google play store changes this version is out of date with the release version and has to be sideloaded to be updated. Hopefully the Kodi team addresses this soon."
To everyone facing the black screen issue: It's because Kodi cannot handle adaptive motion smoothness or higher than 60hz displays. Go to display settings and set display to 60hz. I am sure the dev team is capable of resolving this issue and will do in due time. These new display technologies take time to fully understand and work with.
I absolutely love this app and have for a few years. Exodus is really good to use on it. The only thing that makes me really mad is that sometimes the quality and sound will get really bad so i uninstall it and restart my phone. Then when i go and try to put a new install for exodus it say new version 0.0 and wont install.
It's free so no complaints. Sometimes there's a static sound. Sometimes it doesn't load. There's lots of movies and TV shows for free even new movies that are still in theaters. It's kinda hard to understand how to add add on.
"Works great. If you are getting a black screen, change your refresh rate to 60Hz. I knocked off a star because the menu options refreshes is slow. Sometimes requiring to leave the page and coming back."
"Just when you get it running OK, they release a new version! The Windows version I couldnt to run stably even with latest release on Win10 Home. I tried loading builds manually, then tried Configurator for Kodi to load some builds but gave up. I'm now running Bluestacks on Win10 with Android version of Kodi and Configurator and everything works great. That is until after several reboots the No Limits Magic build skin I'm running disapears , but the apps are all still there under My Addons."
"(Playback Failed Error)(one or more item Failed to play) Error Showning again n again. I tried to solve many times by reinstalling kodi tv app in my android tv with 19.2.3 and 19.4 version & Some few steps like clearing catch files, Updating the Repository files, Updating the versions, Default restore settings but still no changes. The Error still exists. Pls. Give the proper solution for this."
I like this app. I use it on my pc in linux also. I run this on the galaxy tab s7. It's always worked fine but the lastest update 17.3 from the play store had touch screen issues while candy bar mode. Installed the new 19.4 version and it didn't help. Installed the latest beta v20 and that one is working fine again.
"Amazing doesn't describe it, but there's an issue, on the playstation 3 after you open a folder the name of that folder dissapears leaving you a bit lost. I'm unsure if this is kodi or the playstation fault? 🤔 If it can be fixed I will happily change from a 4 to a 5 as this app is insanely amazing."
"Excellent! But after the update, the EXODUS's ""resume/continue from"" functionality is not working anymore, even when I tap resume, it starts playing from the beginning."
One problem is that kodi does not support 120hz refresh rate. If used screen is black. You have to turn on power saving mode or 60hz mode to get it working. But it is only a minor inconvience
"On the whole, I'm really pleased with the Kodi mobile app. It's very simple to use and has all the functions I require. The only thing I wish to see boosted is the rate of loading times."
A great platform that keeps getting better.
"I definitely love Kodi! It's a terrific application for motion pictures, TV programs, as well as sports. The user interface is simple to utilize as well as I've never had any issues with it."
"Kodi version leia , screensaver . When u watch a movie off hdd for example and u pause it by pressing the pause on the remote of nvidia shield pro 2019 model. The movie will pause and then after 1 minute it will go into a black screensaver or in my case i have the stars screensaver. But what i found is that if u pause the movie using the onscreen pause the screen only dims. It does not go into the stars screensaver mode just dims only. I also have dim screen disabled. Can u please fix this."
"For the people with new phones, if you have more than 60fps it won't work. Most phones like my s22 allow you to set it to 60 fps and kodi will work at that point. Hope this helps."
"Frame rate drops on my Vox 55adj798b android 6 tv when subtitle is shown (4k hdr video). When there is no subtitle it plays perfectly. Also Easter Europe Windows subtitle format is not supported? For some videos I hear only sound, but screen is black (except the subtitles) ."
"Love it! But I have a problem with my mouse being out of sinc inside the app. Mouse pointer has to be off the target to click on it, so I wonder is this a bug in the program. Also where is the new update ?? Iknow it's been out for a week and a half"
Works fine apart from TV channel order in user defined groups. Using on Moto G4 with Mythtv backend. No problems EXCEPT if you create a TV channel group and add TV channels - the order seems to be random - PREVIOUSLY the order was the order you added them - perfect when you cannot easily alter backend order & alphabetic is unwanted. This applies to the PC x64 version also so it is a whole build issue not Android version. Kodi devs PLEASE FIX!
fantastic app that unfortunately just constantly has a few bugs
"Had a problem where the app would open to a black screen then close a second later, a fix for this is to clear the cache and the app will work fine. Other than that, the app is pretty great."
This new update will not allow me to open the app at all. The app just crashes as soon as I click on it to open. I am currently using a Galaxy Note 9. Update: Restarting my phone seemed to fix issue.
"Got the app to work. Thanks internet : ) ""Adjust the refresh rate From Settings, search for and select Motion smoothness. Tap Motion smoothness again, and then choose your desired option. Standard refresh rate - A 60 Hz refresh rate. Use this if you want to save your battery life."""
"Hi there, i was looking for an app that could play live tv on android tv without putting cable or dish connection and i got kodi application through youtube. Now i installed kodi app on tv and logged in with my fathers jio number. I'm watching live tv without paying money. I can watch on my father's sjm recharge and no interruptions. But the problem is, I'm not able to watch my 3 favourite channels that helps with knowledge so i would rather request any solution for that. But the app is good."
It worked very well on my Samsung note9 phone. Recently bought and started using Samsung z4 fold phone. As soon as open the application it crashes. Its still working flawlessly on my old phone.
"Work's Pretty good for it to be on your Phablet/Phone/Tablet!! I like it giving I don't use it as much as I should, but I'd like to change that if..::1 You guy's(The Owner's of The App) make an how to video of how to get certain premium channel's like HBO, CinaMax, ShowTime, Starz, Epix, IFC , HDNet, and a few other and have the Live Channels nit the Pre-recorded one's and get the Main Sportscenter Live also and alot more quality video channels..Nothing crazy maybe then I'll be totally on board"
Mmmm. One update good but the next renders it's useless for me on multiple devices of different makes and of different OS's. So ill just put an average rating as I just have to avoid updating. Still a great app but just not in matrix
"Kodi is an amazing app for streaming movies, TV shows, and music. It has a ton of add-ons and features that make it really versatile. I absolutely love it!"
Zip file is not readable in latest version
Seems strange to be refused access to 20! Never been refused before!!!!!!!!!!regards. Roland
"** GALAXY S22 ULTRA USERS** Upgraded to the Galaxy S22 Ultra and Kodi booted up to a black screen. I found out you have to do the following (make sure Kodi app is closed): - Go into your phone Settings > Display > Motion Smoothness > Select ""Standard"" (60hz refresh rate) > reopen Kodi I hope Devs can work with the new 120hz refresh rate on the newer phones in the near future. But for now, I give Kodi 4 stars. Hope this helps! 🤙🏽"
"It's been glitchy since last update (crashing mid load, etc.) and I basically had to uninstall/reinstall (and start over with all my settings, boo) in order to get it to load. But despite the glitches I still am grateful for the app, so thank you :)"
"My BF found this app recently. It has quiet a few new movies on it. Some l don't think have been in theater's yet. It's crazy. Its really neat, because we don't have the app on our RoKu. Only on our phones. Which is nice for personal use, but not for a movie night lol. My BF's phone can cast Whatever is on his phone screen to our TV via Blutooth. It can be a pic, movie, ANYTHlNG that shows up on his screen will show on the TV.....I'm Jelous lol."
Great looking UI my plex server was easy to setup but the video addon for plex was pretty buggy. Touching any point of the screen clicked something completely different.
It works good. Just a small learning curve. BLANK SCREEN ON START UP ISSUE. ****All those with a blank screen on start up. Try changing the phones refresh rate back to 60hz. Thats how i fixed on my flip 4******
"Quite good despite the jumbled interface. Needs a better concept for Music Videos (no, they are not movies)."
Screen goes black on startup if I'm on higher refresh rate. Turning on battery saver or to 60hz will start the app normally. Please look into it developers.g
An update to kill the best add-ons. Pathetic......two iterations and more problems. Why release beta software??? Love Kodi but releases should be usable. This is not usable on Android nor Windows
I kept getting a black screen until I went to my phone settings > Display and changing the screen resolution to HD+. Whenever I finish using kodi I switch it back to the normal settings I had. Kodi should explain this on the app description.
"This customer does not advise the application Android mobile as the main Kodi version does not consist of any type of content what so ever. In addition, Kodi permits you to mount third-party plugins that may provide accessibility to content that is freely readily available on the official material supplier site.

"I installed it and it works great. I've used it elsewhere before, but the add-on I was trying to get depends on Inputstream helper, which won't install for some reason. I have the the git also but I am not fully sure what to do."
I can't get version 19 to work on my Android but it works on my computer but I'm not impressed with 19 the matrix has blacked out the screen completely on three of the five devices I tried to put it on the other two devices wouldn't even let me open the file for matrix so I am currently running 18.9 just have to go on the web browser and download the older version I do love kodi just not the new version yet that's why I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 Stars
Great App love this media Player
The black screen bug seems to be fixed with high refresh rate displays.
"[Feature request]-When on Android TV, please add the ability to start slideshow from any file instead of always from beginning(using tv remote). Fantastic app otherwise."
"works good in my pie..with one defect...if i use bluetooth speaker/headphone and when i load kodi..it just force closes. if i use bluetooth headset during the load, it works fine. Pls fix this"
"It is a bit slow for me but other than that it is fantastic download it if you have fast or medium internet because you can see free movies,tv shows,cartoons,music and more I recommend that you get it now"
"Hi kodi Team, Congrats on making an excellent media app. One tiny suggestion though, could you please add support for 18:9 phones. The app is not scaled in those bigger screens. Hope you take my suggestion."
"This app has plugins that will provide access to most media for free. You can skip subscription services. It's not theft compared to Google not paying tax in any countries, NOW THAT'S EVIL."
It's nice to have the ability to stream roughly whatever u want but the trade off is the app isn't the easiest to navigate and they now have a sub fee
"Ok I have kodi in my fire tv and other one in a fire stick works decently and well so I know how to work it around, but in Android here I did decided to download and for movies that's the only reason I want it, I can't find Exodus nowhere, so I don't like the other add-ons so HELP"
"Its kodi,it is what it is.The better your android box,the better it works Fast internet speed also a big help,but like anything eles it has its in & outs and ups & down, lacks from time to time. In short works OK."
Incredible experience once you find an add- on that works- and find a source within that add-on that also works... the world of cinema is truly at your fingertips.
"Not working with z fold 3 or 4- update. It works at 60hz refresh rate not 120hz. Go to ""Display"" and change to ""60hz"" in the ""Motion Smoothness"" menu on samsung flagship phones."
"I like this player a lot, really serves almost all my needs. I would give 5 stars if you implemented that upon updating the movie library, the deleted movies would be also automatically removed."
updated it and started crashing every time I tried to open it but then all of sudden it started working and it moves faster then the last version 👍👍
"Overall it's a pretty good app, however it can be slow to load sometimes and the buffering is a bit slow also."
"It's ok but they need to make it more user friendly like a remote control user friendly, they should know by now that it's safe to come up and follow suit with other apps they were awesome back in the day and I know they can make a new lead if they want to."
"I love my Kodi. I use it on few devices and platforms. Unfortunately it doesn't work on my new Sony 5 II. When I open the app, screen turns black and there's nothing I can do."
"App works well, just a little issues on OnePlus 7 device, where I need to clear the cache everytime I wish to reopen the app, or it leaves me at a Black Screen."
Kodi 19 is not working properly yet and shouldn't be automatically downloaded to our systems until its fully functional. I had to delete kodi and reinstall 18.9 so i could use my movie platform. Other than that I love kodi
Used to work very well but since I changed phone it is only a black screen when I start the app. I have installed version 20 and then the app work.
I LOVE LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO USE THIS APP! The only thing that really bugs me is the slow processing or functionality of the features and sources.
"If you are having issues with your media server not connecting,   Go into settings,    Select Services,  Select UPnP/DLNA,    Enable UPnP,    Enable announce library updates if it didn't do it automatically.  That should fix it"
The Kodi website said 18.9 has been released but the link to Google play store still has 18.8. I'm trying to be careful because i don't want to lose my addons. No time to start downloading all over again. So I'll wait for Google play update
"no problems what so ever just what ever addons you were running with 17 will not work on 18, but if youre a little techie and have an idea what youre doing youre good to go. I suggest looking up best kodi leia addons of 2019 in youtube. Im pretty fond of the franks addon, alittle bit of playing around but it works."
I love this app would give it a 5 but have it a 4 only because there's always room to improve so ya 4/5 easy! Highly recommend and if you have trouble with it at the beginning that's normal. Every thing you need to know is on YouTube.
Update: After setting refresh rate to 60hz all is normal. Weird but after doing that everything I've tried worked perfectly.
"19.3 navigates fast and effective, plays all my media well, no complaints... other dan Dolby Vision. It doesn't want to play Dolby Vision, at least not with normal colors..."
once a month got to buiild a new one a little time but the manual streaming is alot and stream is tagged not full seen on screen. bad ads stand as you watch. so this clears that up
"miss the 16 version so easy to use. its better then 17, but hard to find apps to play, searching way more, most time i give up. mainly use it for korean drama"
"Works alot better today. Oh there is a learning curve with using a package. If you have willingness to learnan and patients, this has beome my favorite entertainment softwsre . Other then that, dont waste your time ."
Update: It appears that whatever issues existed with this app has been corrected as it's speed and responsiveness have been restored! Thank you. After this last update it has become unbelievably slow. It takes forever to start and bringing up a story takes way too much time. Used to work great.
"I used to be able to post comments on a story, and now it keeps giving me a Error, refresh my page. I've signed out and back on, doesn't help It's taken care of but I need to know how to change user name UPDATE- Never-mind, this once loyal viewer is too disappointed with your code of conduct that I'm going elsewhere. At one time throughout the years I was a proud FOX viewer, not so much anymore."
"Everything is fine except I have zero notifications selected and still get them. Plus, the damn sound affect is very annoying. Sounds like an angry cat."
"I love the pieces explaining the world today. To get the truth with proof to back up what they are saying is nice. There is a huge selection of documentaries, seasons of Cops, talk shows, and much more. I don't know the ins and outs of the situation, but the settlement when many people say you could have won at trial. Then firing Tucker Carlson looks weak. Plus, some content is becoming sympathetic to leftist lies. After saying all of that, there are plenty of great informative things to watch."
I like fox but your adds are 5 times longer than any other social media co. And now there are a lot of glitches where the video goes back to the first. And we have to watch the same video again. This happened three times yesterday.
"Can we make it a little less sensitive to left and right? When I scroll up or down it'll change stories. Maybe I swipe a little diagonal, but it's more up and down as apposed to left and right diagonally."
Biggest issue is when I'm listening to the radio at night and commercials interrupt the shows and sometimes it's 20min of adds before getting back in the middle of a conversation just before they go to a break and another round of commercials
"Now the shows just spinning but when go to a story and click the short video they work with no problem, help!!!!!!!"
I have always enjoyed using this app till recently. The live video is very sporadic. Won't play most of the time. Since then I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it is working better.
"I like the fox app, and I enjoyed reading the comments below articles. Suddenly comments have stopped. Thus the lower rating. Update 2023. The app has been a lot better since I interviewed it in 2021"
"Lately the ads built into the app are looking more and more like articles. This is extremely misleading and greatly decreases Fox New's reputation, something that is failing so many news sources. It also makes it look like Fox endorses those services or products instead of just selling ad space."
"Not bad, seems to open quickly & doesn't shut down. I haven't figured out how to filter my comments so that I can see if anyone replied or agreed. Also, I find myself having to constantly re-expand longer comments in order to read through to the end-keeps auto-contracting back at random."
"My only complaint is the intrusive pop up ads like Candy Crush that make navigating the app difficult. I could try to tap on an article and a sneaky Candy Crush ad pops up and the next thing I know I'm in the app store with a login prompt for CC. It's hyper annoying, bruh."
"Good App, However content lost all appeal due to no longer unbiased sources."
Glad they took the ads off the article list and changed it back to blue. Don't fix what isn't broken!
Very good app works all the time. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that you can't share easily from the business section. They really need to fix that.
"Yeah, the app is fixed for android att direct tv login"
Just my favorite place to watch news and shows. Could do with so many repeat ads. But guys gotta make living..
"Appreciate the great reporting, articles, interviews and videos, especially the high caliber programming, etc. though the app frequently, as in several hours per day, stutters and stalls and doesn't want to play nice. App updates are no help. Hope your software, engineering, and developer team will resolve these frustrating issues."
"App worked good for awhile. Now it won't even open for me. It's been like this for about a week. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Also tried emailing fox but no reply. Update: I reached out to fox again per their request and they asked me a few questions, one being if my phone had its most recent update. It turned out it needed to be updated. Did the update and the app works now."
"Suspect negatives are politically motivated. Loaded fast when I tested load time... 15 sec to install. Download was a few seconds via WiFi. The app is easy to use. I found no bugs in the years I have used it. There are ads as you scroll down. It is picture intensive, so if you are using a slow cell, it takes time to load. They could do better through incremental load, so four stars."
"Overall a great app. One thing that is continuously frustrating is when I'm watching something and pause it, if I leave it paused for too long, it turns off the video and you have to start it over. You have to try to find where you were by going through every commercial again. I'm not sure if there is a way to have it save where you are in the video, but I haven't found it."
"App works well for me and really like the new search feature with the latest update. The only complaint I have, which started a couple of updates ago is say there are 10 new notifications, if I select one notification to read, the other 9 notifications disappear. I usually like to select the ones of interest when I have time to read and save others for later. Once they disappear its hard to go back and recall which ones I wanted to read up on. Phone is a Galaxy S22 Ultra."
"The app on my Samsung Galaxy 7s freezes when attempting to watch live TV. In order to watch live TV work again, I went to app settings and cleared all the Fox app data (storage) on the phone... FYI reinstalling the app does not work- I tried it. After clearing the data, I had to re-sign in my cable provider credentials to watch to live TV."
"This has been a good app for a while but now more and more articles are being written in a clickbait style. ""This state has the highest new cases of COVID-19"" with vaugue details meaning one has to view the article to find out the full title if the story. Since I have been training myself to avoid clickbait I now avoid these articles even if they sound interesting. It is getting annoying."
"The app does what a news app is supposed to, has live video service if you have service with a provider but I'm taking away a star because I keep my notification volume at max because I work in a very loud environment, and the breaking news alert from the app is ridiculously obnoxious especially at maximum volume and there is no option to disable or change the alert type or sound used. If I could use my phones set default alert sound it would be fine then."
"I used to love this app. Now it won't load. It just hangs at the initial launch screen that says Fox News. No actual news loads, though. I'm using a Pixel 4XL and the app updated 4 days ago. Seems to be an issue with the recent update. 2/16/2022 update: The app seems to be working properly again. Thanks!"
"I'm now changing my previous ranting review. It turns out that the issue of not being able to sign on and stream has been addressed. The problem is that you have to know where to sign in with your cable provider. On the bottom right corner is ""For you"" button. After clicking on it, you need to scroll all the way down until you see ""Settings"". In there you will see the option to log in. It's been working well and some of the app's other wonkiness seems to have improved as well."
"I like the app . Please add Chromecast support. Android TV version seems to occasionally run into issues with the spinning circle like it's loading, usually backing out and going back in solves it but sometimes the whole Shield TV needs to be rebooted. This is on a very fast and stable internet connection and excellent WiFi."
"I couldn't find the headline news, that I wanted to see"
"The app's interfacing with my cable provider is glitchy sometimes, and I have to reload every couple of months. Other than that, it is a great app. I call BS on all the 1 star reviews. They are triggered trolls. My experience on many different phones, over many years is in keeping with the 3,4 and 5 star experiences."
"I need some help with this problem..... Installed the fox news app, it worked great for a few weeks then all of a sudden the app on the screen just disappears. Its still installed on the phone but to get the pic of fox news back on the screen i have to uninstall and then install again. Sometimes it will stay for a day or maybe an hour. I have a new android phone and this does not happen with any other apps that i have Any help would be appreciated"
App is okay. I am officially uninstalling after years with Fox because no more Tucker Carlson.
My notifications of breaking news opens directly to the website and not the app. Please fix.
"UPDATE FOR BELOW: I deleted the App and reinstalled. I was prompted for my cable TV provider. It now works. Apparenty, the app dropped my cable TV provider and you have to go throught the process outlined above to re-insert it. ---- I can no longer view whole shows, even going through Spectrum. A new banner has appeared saying l have 10 minutes a trial time left. Can't watch live broadcasts either. If ther have discontinued service and want a digital subscription now they should tell me."
Too many useless photos in push notifications. Most photos tell stories that only need a few words to describe. Why waste the data on a photo of a person talking when it overwrites the text of what was said? Take a look at some of your national broadcasting competitors for better notifications.
The app was fine with 1 or 2 glitches. But I had to get off of Firefox and get off of Google in order to download the app from Google no less while on DuckDuckGo. Google would not let me type in the correct address nor would it let me take the preset address. Problem isn't always what you want the problem is how you're having to get there. It's at the problems with having to download an app from only one source.
"I'm not a conspiracy guy, but this conservative app has quadrupled in data usage over the last 4 months. I uninstalled the app/reinstalled it. It's the only app that loads slow and devours data. I used over 10.5 MB just scrolling headlines w/I opening a story in less than 1 minute. Worth checking into. Seems big tech is at it again trying to dissuade it's use.."
"Dare I say the video issue gas been fixed? Yes. I can press the live video button and it works every time, without having to login each time. The video still plays when pressing home, but you can swipe the app away to close it. That's a small inconvenience."
"I like the app. Although recently, I have been getting notifications and when clicked they used to take me to the story....now just open the app to the homepage. Half the time the article that I clicked on from my notification isnt on the app. I have to try and search for it. Frustrating."
"Generally good. Hate that when I see a photo for an article and click on the story that the photo related to the story disappears and some random, completely unrelated photo come up instead. Can't see the photo I want and the random ad photo completely detracts from the story - makes me want to read less in the app, not more."
"Overall pretty good. Runs fast, smoothly. I don't have issues with ads or notifications like others have said. But I really wish they would add the feature for us to track our comments and replies to our comments. No way to have a discussion or debate without having to scroll through each article, and with most popular stories, there are hundreds of comments per minute. So please add comment tracking ability!"
I like the app for the most part. However I am really getting annoyed by this ad for local news that keeps coming up showing what look like mugshots. I keep closing the add and it comes back the next time I open it. Please stop showing me this ad.
"overall excellent. like the integration of fox news radio within the one app. only complaint is on opening the app there is a transition ""white page"" during the screen build that essentially appears like a camera flash..... annoying and actually distracting in low light levels. gotta fix that one......"
It was doing great but now when reading an article as I try to scroll up it goes back to the top of the article. I have to put a finger on the screen to hold it in place to pull up the article to continue reading. Not sure it was from a recent update on the app or my phone.
"Something is wrong...the news stories are not being shown and the message is that the story can not load, check my connections. There is no problem with the connections. Is this an issue with your system or is Google blocking your stories!"
"This used to be a good app but it has stopped working since the April update. It keeps saying ""Unable to connect. Check your connection and try again."" My connection is fine, the app is broke! Update... the July 6 version is working much better, thanks."
"I really like reading the comments, but they have one particularly annoying behavior -- some number of seconds (about 15) after tapping ""Read more"" on a long post, the expanded section automatically collapses back to its initial ""Read less"" state. I wouldn't mind if the time was perhaps one minute, but it's only about 15 seconds. Want 5 stars, Fox? Remove the automatic collapse and let the reader have the freedom to control their own reading experience."
"Love the app and content, but am frustrated by the alerts that I have shut off, yet they continue to come. Just started with the Covid19 alerts. I have them off, but they still happen. Please turn them off according to the settings put in place by the user!"
"it would be a five but for 2 issues. 1. and this is minor, your editors don't catch alot of English mishaps. 2. this is a major one, the new update changes my brightness settings. it is really annoying when I am comfortable with my phone and all of a sudden get lit up. please fix"
"Overall I've had few issues with this app but in the last 2 months there's this annoying tune that starts playing when I click on a story to read. Da da dah, fingersnaps fingersnaps etc. Doesn't last long but I have to mute my phone when I'm on this site."
I like your app and use it daily for up to date news. It is a bit irritating to try to watch a video that is in the news story only to find that I first have to watch a 30 second commercial that I can not skip.
"I use this app every day. To stay up to date. The biggest and only complaint I have is that most of the commercial breaks, play the same commercial 3-4 times during that break. Also, a lot of time is spent on a screen telling me to scan the ar code to get the app, that I am using?"
"App has worked perfect for over 1 year. Starting yesterday it appears Direct TV has starting blocking access to watch live. I have uninstalled / reinstalled this app rebooted my phone tried logging in using multiple wifi Hotspots and my mobile date. After logging in, it just times out forever. Ongoing issue over 48 hours now. Direct TV allows me to sign in to CNN but not Fox!"
Love the app. Except you can't change your service provider. I switched providers so now I can no long watch live as it has me with my old provider so of course they denigh my access. You neeed to add an update profile/service provider please or make it easy to find if there already is one!
I confirmed the advice from another post regarding live TV connection issues. Go to FOR YOU at the bottom of the app. Scroll to the very bottom to settings and find the log in to provider setting. In past this popped up automatically. Now you must do this manually. Steaming live again.
"Works fine. No lockups not many ads. I'm not sure what all the past issues were or how legit they were since we all know Fox triggers some limited thinkers. Runs the videos and stories fine. Biggest issue with Fox is they are stuck in the studio, rarely out in the field or reporting in hot areas like Ukraine."
I just want news and articles without hate involved. I have noticed ever since 2016 hatefulness is growing by leaps and bounds. Can we keep to the news? Real news and not the hate that is showing so frequently in our country today. I'm not sure how to put this but cancel culture and hate has taken over too much of our lives. Please stay newsworthy and continue with the Truth and love that we so desperately need nowadays.
"Good, informative, and to the point"
"I love to have FOX news available on an app, but I have found that the headlines and stories very often don't match up to the videos that open when I select a story. The headlines don't coincide with the correct videos. It is hard to find and watch the video I want to see."
"There have been several times I havent been able to connect to the live TV option. Have had to uninstall/reinstall to get it to work at times. Otherwise, I love the convenience of being able to catch my fave shows on here when I'm away from home."
"Too much celebrity news. And I use the term ""Celebrity"" loosely. Headline often references a vidieo that is preceeded by a lengthy ad and many times what actually plays is a FOX news video. If your headline says there's a video, let it be there!"
"I have had problems since installing the Fox News app. When trying to read the comments, when I clicked on ""more"" (to read the full comment), or on any replies to that comment, I was immediately bumped back up to the beginning of the site, a blue wall. I found that uninstalling and reinstalling the app stopped this. But now, if I exit the app and come back on, the same problem recurs. Am I the only one? Can you help? This is very frustrating!"
"On some of the news articles, when sliding up the screen on the smart phone to continue reading, the article keeps going back to the first screen. It's frustrating and annoying!"
"Great App With One Small Flaw In My Opinion. I have always respected Fox News and this app is great but I could do without ""sprinkling"" annoying and pointless Hollywood updates in with the real news. There are entertainment stories that deserve to be headlines but who is arguing on The Voice or what someone wore last night to an award show should be under the Entertainment heading or better yet on another app."
"Sometimes another article opens when I click a link andcsuggests I use the app, yeahhhh doing that...."
You need to mark clearly all ads. You kind of use click baiting. And love fox news. On 24hrs a day 7 days a week and on my phone. Good job guys
"It is nice that you don't have to go back to the home screen to keep reading like CBS, NBC, ETC."
Only gripe I have is that once you back out of the video it doesn't remember where you left off. I'm having to write down times when I stop watching a video and ff to that point. Other than that it works great
"When you use this app on the Samsung galaxy s20 ultra; the pause, play, rewind options don't disappear off the full display screen. This is an app problem not a phone problem because it doesn't do this with the YouTube app."
I love the app and have for years BUT I want to cancel my subscription and get the fox nation instead and I just can't not seem to figure out how. If I cancel the app or delete it from my phone will I still be charged? Somebody anybody help please..lol! Been wanting to do this for months now..ugh! THANKS to whoever contacted me about wanting to stop the app BUT you were wrong. I AM being charged $5.99 a month. I looked it up on my bank statement and all I want is to stop the payment! HELP!
"Lost a star because I can't filter what I consider ""breaking news"" worthy to alert me. Too often I get alerts I don't care about, at least not enough to need an alert. An example is sports: I love sports but I don't need ""breaking news"" alerts every time an athlete of a team I don't follow says something."
"The app that works great for me except for the latest update for some reason when I play videos it won't take the pause, fast forward and rewind button off the screen any longer and makes the screen darker so I can't see"
"I do believe I've FOUND the problem! This worked me! Using your phone click on ""For You"" @ the bottom right of your screen. Scroll down to bottom & click on settings The first item at the top was ""log into your provider"" I don't remember if it required that I log in when first downloading the app but I hadn't logged out but.............The ETERNAL WHEEL HAS DISAPPESRED, IT NO LONGER HAS THE ""10 MIN PREVIEW MESSAGE & I'M WATCHING ALL OF FOX VIDEOS AGAIN!"
The content is excellent but I would prefer the notifications be customizable to not include sports updates. Score updates in big games end up spoiling the ending for those who are watching a recording.
I likeistening to Fix news reports and I trust them to be unbias n factual and non partisan reporters telling the truth about Americans events n news thx CS 😊
they shouldn't allow ads thar redirect to scams
I don't know why I must reopen when I use this app!!
"Good APP which functions well. Authors should learn to place the Bottom Line Up Front in their articles. I will read their supporting evidence and additional findings. However, articles hiding the bottom line should be cut."
Great News app. Would give 5 stars if there was an option for the loud notification. Can we turn off the sound and have the news still pop up on our phones? The sound is very loud and annoying especially at work.
I like some of the podcasts and news not all of it but some of it.
I loved this app. But lately it's been freezing up my phone and all the live feed have been locked! No place to enter service provider so I uninstalled it til bugs are fixed.
I cannot stand the breaking news sound . It's startling and happens in the middle of the night waking us up because I use the alarm on the phone . Each night I delete and each morning I re install
This isn't just a review it's more of a suggestion for cord cutters like me. I suggest that you go full subscription mode than I can watch my favorites. I would happily pay a good price for this than I would not have to be a cable subscriber to get the channel. Thanks for reading this and hope you think about it
"I like using cnn, abc and fox to compare and contrast for content. Got rid of abc then cnn due to app crashing and displaynig more ads then content continually. I've never had any issues with the fox app. All 3 play 15 sec ads before EACH video clip and it needs to stop"
"Like the app, however I have been having a problem with the videos crashing after about 30 seconds. I have a Samsung S10 and it's the only app I am having trouble with."
Could add the ability to filter what news comes across. I really don't care about sports so thats not really breaking news for me. Make it slightly more personalized Thanks!
"The website is working well again. I contacted the support team directly, and the issue with not being able to see replies to my comments was fixed overnight. The problem continues while in the Fox News app but I get around it by simply logging directly into the FOX website."
"Galaxy S9 plus user. Works very well. Fast. Loads in seconds. Easy to use. Closed Captioning on videos! Ty FOX!. Downside: comments section could use some work. Maybe a ""tag"" notification if one has been replied to. Ty FOX!"
There was obviously an organized effort In Jul 2020 to bury this app with bad reviews about its bias. Any idiot knows Fox is generally conservative. It does not kill my battery and it installed as quickly as any other app. My only issue is that it is slow to go from story to the next.
"The layout of this app prioritizes articles ""importance"" as the editor sees fit, and facilitates the reader to subconsciously create a skimming reading pattern. That in turn results in more readers seeing much more content to fulfill the pattern"
"I like the format and the updating of the article rotation. One star removed for no comment section. Update. In the browser version comments are there, but only if you use a non-google browser. Such as duckduckgo. Hmmm. Update 06/11/21 The app now includes the comment section. It's nice to see reactions. Sometimes even an intelligent comment from the other point of view. Update my screen name is not working. And any alternative doesn't work."
There seems to be a reoccurring issue with several stories where I scroll to the bottom to look at comments but the additional stories only display halfway and I can never see the comments. I wonder whether this is a factor of my Android phone or the app or both.
"Great content, but the ""FEATURES & FACES"" section (the one with the all the pictures that slide to the left) CONSTANTLY FREEZES. I could almost place a bet on that! WHY IS THAT??"
"Stick to the news. If I have to hear one more repeat episode of ""strange inheritance"" or about a house painted like van gough....I'm gonna lose my mind. Stick. To. The . News. Great app other than the constant repeating shows that aren't news."
Well much much better then other news sources/apps... but still.. too much creationist bias... biased.. but better then radical pc left bias... Seems like over the years fox keeps getting better and better... Just keep in mind people that the 2 party system is broken..
I have had this app for a while and have genuinely enjoyed it. I only give 4 stars and might even lower that because of stupid game ads that take up most of my screen and have sound that won't go away.
I love FOX news but I'm disappointed in their new app update because a lot of the shows are now blocked unless you have a cable provider code to unlock the current episodes. Also there aren't as many readable news updates.
"It would be great if you could choose which articles you get notifications for (e.g. only Politics and Health or only breaking news) instead of having all or none. Otherwise, it's a good app."
Like getting the breaking news notifications. A lot I don't care about but they are customizable. And if course biased but we all know that
"I've always avoided reading most docs on the phone screen - can't deal with tiny characters and scrolling all over But just now I needed to test a just-created PDF for the overall look and feel. Well, Acrobat offered to turn on Liquid mode and Wow! The document is readable and whatever minor reformatting was done - say large headings - is not objectionable! Nice!"
"I like Acrobat Reader! With its costs subscription, you get an impressive PDF editor that enables you to edit text and also images, a PDF converter to export to as well as from PDF, as well as a host of various other innovative features. It's the ideal device for creating, integrating, as well as organizing PDFs with ease. Very recommended!"
"It opens up and had found documents I had forgotten about, It was 3 of them. As for being ad free that's a far fetch! As soon as I opened the app a full page Google ad popped open and it's damn hard to get around at first then there's streamers on the bottom of the page plus pop ups I then had tried to delete 2 of the 3 document's it found 4 times, guess what... They are still on my phone. I have used Adobe since their start up and like it. I just don't get how they can say. Ad free?"
"I found a bug. I have android 6.0.1 on a Lenovo Tab 10. The app offers two opportunities to make annotations. One involves using a long press anywhere on the PDF and then annotating. Another involves tapping the blue pen circle. If you long press, all freehand highlighting marks shift down and no longer highlight what they are meant to highlight. Very frustrating. Could you fix this? However, if you click the blue pen to make your annotations, everything works out. Otherwise, I am very happy with this application."
"A solid and well known app, this is a great option for almost anything you may need to do. Good rendering, nice view options, good annotations, and good form filling. I'm only giving 4 stars, though, for two reasons: 1) It feels a little dated and cumbersome. I get the feel while using it that the design and flow of the app is in need of an overhaul 2) There are some features missing from this app that are available on a Windows/Mac, if you have a premium subscription."
"The app is pretty good! I like that I can fill in forms directly from the app, but I do find it a bit confusing how to exit ""form filling mode"" when I want to print the document I've filled out. Also, I'm not sure if this is Acrobat Reader's issue or the issue of whoever makes the pdfs, but sometimes the font size chosen for a fillable field is too big and the tops of letters get cut off. I would like to be able to adjust that!"
"Much better ""editing"" abilities than other apps (""editing"" a PDF just means adding notes, highlighting, underlining and strikethroughs, not modifying text). But if you do need to modify the text of a PDF a lot, the monthly subscription to Adobe (which I have) does a good job and is easy to use even without a lot of training. If you don't ned to modify text a lot, you probably only need the free version."
"Great app for viewing pdfs and minimal editing, especially very large files such as books. The main thing that could use some improvement is the home interface. It takes way too many clicks to get to a saved file, and starring all of the files would defeat the purpose. It would be nice if we could 'favorite/star' a folder rather than just a file, or if we could set the home screen to files on device, cloud files, or other servers depending on what we use most."
"Solid choice for the PDF software out there. It has a few annoying features--specifically, non-removable menu options that are for subscripion-only services--but overall is reliable and predictable. I like that it gathers all of the pdf files on my device without having to import them. On occasion there is a delay in rendering some pages but that is likely just a device issue. I recommend the app and keep it on all of my Android devices."
"I use this program frequently, with access to both its mobile and PC versions, to safely store and look up all kinds of files offline. Even files that are hundreds of pages long load up in just a matter of moments. The only downfall is the number of functions (such as editing) locked behind a paywall, which is why my rating is 4 stars. However, this does not affect being able to view and store documents."
"I use this app frequently for reviewing construction documents and drawings. It's always served me well, as it is significantly more stable than viewing with a browser, especially with large files. I would like to see the ability to add folders built into the app. This is a feature that is available on the iOS version of the app, and allows files to be organized in app. Little disappointing that simple feature is not available on Android."
It is an ad-free product that enables you to read without distraction. It has many great features that can be accessed depending on the type of account you have. Sometimes it's challenging to get find your particular file of interest because it doesn't automatically update new files in it's library. Above all it provides a good reader experience.
"overall good experience. was able to read and edit a pdf. however there seems to be a lack of save options. i cannot rename a file in the app. while i can save a pdf it loses its edit functionality. this is very important when filling out multple of the exact same form that may need changes later. Add the ability to change the name of a file, copy a file, and save while preserving editable function and its a 5 star app"
"Was working fine....Until today. Well, I noticed it today. It could have been malfunctioning yesterday or the day before for all I know, but I hadn't used it until today. It force closes without fail, and that little message pops up saying ""Acrobat for Samsung has stopped working"" and gives me the option to close the app or look at some sort of info. It won't open at all, tried it numerous times over the last few hours Note 10+ running Android 10, One UI 2.1, and the August security patch."
"Adobe had been a useful tool when it comes to viewing pdf files and I can't recommend it more. It is also widely used app/software across different platform. However, when it comes to editing pdf files it's a bit complicate as you have to use another Adobe app. It's kinda inconvenient but the app does as it says so I ain't gonna complain. But if there was a way of rearranging, duplicating, copying and removing pages would make more convenient. This is with free access of course."
"Obviously, the leader in pdf's. However, ""liquid mode"" is a pain, and now I cannot easily find a way for it to NOT open in said mode. 1. Users cannot easily move to specific pages. I was trying to quickly get to page 87, and it was significantly more difficult. There is no point to this madness. 2. The extra load time cancels any added benefit."
"Great app. Adobe has been around for years, and is still a reliable, remarkably stable, platform. I've only had one problem that happened recently, and not sure if that particular problem was hardware or software related. It had been with an older HP printer. I couldn't locate a driver with which to print a .pdf file. My own uncertainty is the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise, I love the fact this app is available and doesn't tie one to a desk top computer. Thanks Adobe!"
"This is a good clean app. BUT, you have to download a separate app to scan. A separate app if you want to sign in without password?!! What? Only allows sharing to email or by link. Also, when you are asked to sign in, you have to do in on two separate pages; first email, then password (why can't this be done on the same page so my pass managers can work?). If this app was more intuitive, it might be better than the other apps that do everything in one app and don't take up the storage."
"Zoomed view and formation were great! But I don't think I will try again. This updates could have been better. ""Less zoom"" concept was very useful UNTILL I add comments on the paper. When I selected lines to highlight, it just changed to original paper view, and unselected lines, so I had to read again to find the selected section. If the zoomed view can add comments, then it will be great."
"Liquid mode is amazing! However, it would be even better if the file didn't have to be processed through the document cloud each time I return to it since it can take a while to process, especially if it is a bigger file. It'd be really nice if it would remember my position in liquid mode as well. I would also really like to be able to highlight text in liquid mode...even better would be to have the highlighted text then appear on the original document. Thanks!"
"Wonderful app since the one my android phone comes with is trash. It has removed my place when I go back to a pdf I was looking at very rarely but that's the only real issue. Two tips I have to make a folder in your downloads for all your pdfs, it will save the app time having to look through everything to find them and the other is to search under ""This Device"" when trying to find your pdfs. Other than that, it's a great app and I recommend getting it."
Rating is based on reading PDFs as that is all I've been using it for. It is much better to read PDF books in this app than it is in Kindle or the default Android PDF reader. It remembers your place and provides a page by page view. It would be nice for the page to be saved to the cloud version as well so that reading across devices is easier. I would also like for the zoom to be saved across pages for PDFs that have small text.
"Premium Access finally went through after waiting hours and hours. It can't edit anything that's on the SD Card so I moved the files to my phone's built in storage and now it works perfectly. App permissions are all on, so why it doesn't work when every other app I have works, I have no idea because I'm not a programmer. All I know is that it doesn't work editing anything on my SD Card. 5 stars IF they can fix it."
"It's very easy to read a PDF with this app. The sharing features are great, dark mode, reflowing text (for PDFs less than 200 pages long) but there is one painful aspect of this app: getting the document you're reading to fullscreen is an exercise in patience. You just tap on the page, but tapping without your finger moving a single atom in any direction is quite the challenge. Please consider making it way way way easier to simply tap the page to fullscreen."
"Great PDF viewer at its core, very fast and very stable. But it's so aggressive in trying to get the user to sign in that it might as well be a MSFT product, you can't even click the share button without signing in first. Also the nagging popups. ""Have you tried liquid mode? Have you? No really, have you? How about today? What about now?"" Very irritating."
"Pretty good - no problem opening and editing docs, but the file management part of it is hinky. The UI is different from Windows' file saving look and feel, and a lot of the time I have to browse which ends up pulling up Windows' file interface anyway. Why not cut to the chase and make things faster?"
"Although others have built PDF readers, I haven't found any that compare to Adobe's. One option I'd like to see is an alternate, perhaps optional view for recent files; there is precious little space that anything but a very short filename is abbreviated to something almost undistinguishable from other entries. Landscape mode helps, but not always enough and switching is an extra step. Consider an optional 2-line display or even an N-line display where the full titles are guaranteed to show."
This app is very convenient. It helps me read and edit my PDF files on the go and works well with the fill-in/signing function. The full in can be buggy meaning that the fonts are sometimes different sizes and can't be changed to the same size but it can be fixed with some effort. over all this app is great and easy to use.
"Seems to work well enough for my basic needs. I use it on my tablet to read an online-only PDF magazine that I subscribe to, so having the ability go back to the last read page and bookmark pages is a handy feature.  I don't really have a need for the cloud features, though."
"With my personal use, I would just like to suggest two things. First is to have more highlight colors, since personally, I have color preferences that I find more effective for my reading. Maybe you could add a color picker with a hex code input or something. Second, have the highlight colors in sync between mobile and pc apps. I tend to switch between devices depending on convenience. For the other app features, I find them very useful, especially the saving on cloud. Thank you! ❤"
"The fonts are clearly displaced and make for an easy read. I also love all the other added options such as highlighting, adding notes, underline, etc. One thing I would prefer is easy switch between the added functions. Sometimes, I struggle with switching between highlighting to just adding a comment. It appears that if you don't click on edit, you can't do some functions easily."
"Adobe Acrobat is great! My only problem is the share option. It seems to be a little more complicated then it needs to be. Maybe having a quick share option (mobile), so one doesn't have to go through the email. Other then a few details Adobe does the job. I have the Adobe scan app as well ..great app! Adobe is a SOLID application for mobile use & my home CPU."
"Clean look, easy to use the most important tools like, switching between type or draw, I'm enjoying this app far more than I ever did for any pdf program, it's Acrobat after all, the 1st version of it was slightly more functional than a pet rock, and less attractive hehe, this version is beautifully designed, so easy to use and its still free, I will consider paying for some tools,"
"I am going to graduate school while holding down a full-time job. The only way I could make this work is by listening to my assigned reading PDFs in Read Aloud mode while I do chores or exercise. Thanks so much for this great feature. The one problem I have: the speech-to-text consistently drops letter groups ""fi"" or ""fl"" to just ""f"" or nothing. So ""specifically"" is read as ""specically"" and ""reflect"" is ""refect."" It seems consistent so might be a software bug."
"It works very well. I have wifi with Xfinity. They take up half a day, logging in or on the phone. Hate them BUT! Sorry bout that. This app is great. Wish it would show type and sizing but it does not."
"I like what I see, but to make this APP rock. You need to make it so it can read Aloud with the ability to select text to read, and to make it to display the text as it's being read, and to have an option to read and display text so it can be followed easily, with an option to highlight text as it's being read. If you can find other enhancements to make it FULLY HANDICAPPED-USER-ACCESSIBLE, AND USER-FRIENDLY. THIS APP WILL ROCK! For those with Vision IMPAIRMENT, REAL ACCESSIBILITY COULD BE DONE"
"This is great. I use it to sign documents. But I always spend about 30 minutes searching where the documents are hidden! I download attachment from email app, sign it, save, but there's no save-as browse function so that you can save it where you can know where find it again to email it back."
Essential but very pricey at 9.99 a month.The app is needed to save screenshots and a lot of documents or anything long that needs to saved. It does several functions better than all other pdf apps. I can't go without it but the price is I guess it's worth it.
"Adobe Acrobat Reader mobile application is a great application for anybody seeking a credible PDF visitor. With more than 635 million installs, it's a leader in the space. You can utilize it to save your documents online and also read them anywhere, making it an excellent device for organization or personal use. Additionally, you can see, share, annotate as well as add e-signatures to PDF records."
It was totally amazing. Learned a lot in one workshop. Made it look so easy. Felt so at home. Wanted to join for a second workshop. Very exiciting. Can't wait for my make-up to start practicing. Just loved it so much. Will recommend to anyone who is interested in professional make-up. Brilliant experience.
"Thanks for the convenience to complete and sign, as well as the convenience to listen to documents, even while walking, gardening and driving, it's superb! Would enjoy ability to insert a text box Thanks so much Adobe, much appreciated"
"Very quick, saves a lot of time compared to traditional scanner. Documents usually clear although, on the only multiple paged document I have tried, only the first page was clear with 90% of the remaining 4 illegible."
I like the app and all but it suddenly won't let me access files that are supposedly saved to Adobe cloud storage. I thought All files would still be available offline or does that not apply once it's saved to cloud storage?
"This app is a fantastic app, really! Yet I'll give it a 4🌟 as it disappoints me when it comes to making annotations while in reading mode. I can't seem to highlight texts and that can be frustrating😤. Please do something about that, I'd really love to make highlights whilst reading. Thank you."
"It works without the new onorus partners... At least visibly. Reply to Adobe; There is nothing anyone can do under the current ruinous monetary environment. Thanks for asking. Adobe is among the best in third party controls, i might add."
"I have been using Adobe Acrobat for a while, and I must say that it is one of the most comprehensive and feature-rich PDF editing and management software available on the market today. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing me to quickly find the tools I need to create, edit, and manage PDF documents. As someone who also uses other Adobe products, I appreciate how seamlessly Adobe Acrobat works with Adobe Creative Suite. One of the things I love about Adobe Acrobat is its powerf"
"I *really* like the Liquid feature! Very helpful. And now that I figured out that I have to use Google text to speech engine in my phone vs. Samsung engine, I will be using the Read Aloud feature a lot. UPDATE: Read Aloud does not work if the .pdf is >200 pages. Why?"
It is really nice for opening any kind of documents...we can highlight the underline..but there is only one problem it doesn't open a document of high weighted file (large size)
"It's a convenient and easy-to-use app for viewing, annotating, and sharing PDF documents on the go. With its intuitive interface and a range of useful features, including annotation tools and digital signature support, it's an essential tool for mobile professionals."
"Helped me fill out a job application that I actually got. Without Adobe, I don't know where I'd be. Probably homeless and jobless. Also, I don't know if it was a coincidence or Adobe themselves, but my hemorrhoids are no longer an issue. And on top of that, I no longer have to rely on big Billy's jerky sticks that I had to ate since I was homeless. But now thanks to Adobe, I don't have to have big Billy's meat in my mouth anymore! So thank you Adobe 🥰"
"It's very handy when dealing with documents on the go. Personally, I found it most helpful when going through an apartments application process, job hiring process, and for viewing Bank and stocks information."
"I appreciate Adobe Acrobat as an excellent document reader, with ease of use and clarity of text being top aspects. However, inability to resolve a billing issue prevents a 5 star rating on my part."
The app is good but the read aloud feature is not available on offline and can't be played in a loop. Please make it which can help a lot.
It was so perfect until its started glitching or smth. All my documents or pdf turned into constrast colours and even old documents from yeasr ago that i had deleted started appearing. I am installing it again and hopefully it turns back to normal
"Good app, stable and functional. Stable, functional app. I wish it was useful as a file browser app, too, but that's obviously not its primary purpose."
"I'm still trying to connect the app to my printer so I don't know whether the printer is at fault, the app or my phone."
"Lightning fast, stable and very easy-to-use PDF reader. But it starts to get laggy if you're trying to edit one."
"Previous issue (in 2021) got fixed after update soon after, thanks. Overall I'm very happy with this app, as the best for opening pdfs. However I'm now apprehensive to update, after reading reviews saying it's now cloud storage only? I don't want this as too much hassle, besides with poor mobile signal here I'd have difficulty accessing my files at all.- I just want to keep them on my phone. 'If it ain't broken, please don't fix it.' It would be good to have more details about upcoming updates."
"It works really good . I like the fact you can save stuff to the cloud making it easier to share or see across all my devices. I like how the signature is saved and used for use on future documents. The functionality on mobile is sufficient enough to fill out sent documents , and respond easily. I find it very useful but the cost being around 20$ would be my only complaint and why I deducted one star. I feel the price is a little high , more around 10$ for my use case would be better."
Still the best for .pdf files.. hopefully they would give out a much better package fee in terms of their premium service..
"Great as usual , it's the best Safe that you can depend upon, it makes life easier ,it protects important things and files, As long as you have the Adobe Acrobat App Thanks to the brilliant people and ideas ..."
"I really love the liquid mode , the only downside of it, is that doesn't allow to highlighting which is a very important activity for me while reading."
"Work best with liquid mode, but sometimes you need to revert back to normal mode on mobile as pictures with their comments are misplaced if we need to corelate both."
"Really helps me when I have to download important documents or paperwork,and if you need to sign some documents you can do it right on your phone, it's good to have , I really like it, I recommend it"
It is a nice app and did what I wanted. Kindly make it easy to unsubscribe as it was easy to subscribe. Just add a unsubscribe button? Somewhere on the app.
A good application without any problems. It has many updated features for editing.
"I'm extremely amazed with the premium subscription of Acrobat Viewers! It's an excellent PDF editor that allows you to edit text and photos, transform to and also from PDF, and also also offers advanced features like integrating PDF documents, arranging PDFs, as well as much more. This is an essential application for Android mobile users."
Adobe reader works well on my pc and on my smartphone. I am learning the new GUI on my smartphone. On my pc i installed an adobe cloud program that was not usefull to me. It used a lot of resources... so i uninstalled it.
Does a very good job. My ONLY problem is the screen going off while reading. Would love it if you could add (Keep Screen On) option to it.
"Since I have been using this app, the experience is amazing, even though there are sum charges on some features, but I would like to share my opinion that is the best Pdf tool. It is fast as well as well designed."
"06/04/23 Latest version appears to have fixed the app crashing on opening a pdf file in Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus, Fire OS 8 (Android 11). Needs option in settings to deselect dark mode when battery saver is on."
Good app. However content button should be brought to foreground so that it becomes easier by one click to navigate pdf document with content on smartphone. Thanks
If only the editing option would be easily available. Otherwise its a brilliant application and easy to navigate.
"An excellent app for anyone who needs to edit PDFs. I've found it to be very user-friendly and efficient. The only downside is that it can be a little slow at times, but overall I've been very pleased with it."
"After a while it becomes quite cluttered. When downloading documents to sign,read,etc. But the application works fine."
It's good and there's a lot of good feature. One of my fav is liquid mode. But i can't view epub files on this. This should be upgraded.
Acrobat Reader is easy to use app and really it helped me a lot for years. I love reading with Acrobat Reader.
"S-Pen functionality could be a bit better.. clunky, not smooth to use the text function."
"Whoops!! Its shame if I do not speak the light, this app will never come as it is for the best of our needs. No more I can suggest to add really."
"The Adobe Acrobat Reader mobile app is an amazing tool that can be used to read PDF files anywhere. This app is the world’s most trusted PDF viewer and is free to download. You can store your files online and read them anywhere, making it a great tool for documenting your work and sharing them with others. Additionally, you can view, annotate, and add e-signatures to PDF documents, making it an invaluable tool for secure communication."
Hello dear.... I'm really enjoying this app But one very essential feature this app requires is to have an option to go for internet search of any selected word.... Please consider regarding this Thanks.....
"Couldn't see anything......UNLIKE THIS GUY..... If you follow directions correctly the pdf file reader allows access to files your phone cannot show you..,.THANK YOU"
"I don't know what to say but, it is amazing application it really helps me a lot, without any additional advertisement."
"I'm not really fond of it, but I know Adobe's been around for quite sometime now generally speaking. Any cpu service thats had longevity usually takes the time to perfect their craft. That being said, the little bit I did navigate, lets me know it can very much so hold its own efficiently! 👍🏾"
"Quit handy app for somone who read through pdfs, easy to edit. But u can only open pdfs in it and not ppts, exel sheets etc"
As a student I really appreciate it . It is very helpful and easy to use application. This app is as work as look in ads & photos.I give this app 4 star 🌟 because some documents in my gallery aren't highlight . But they are only some documents that doesn't mean for me so its not a big problem. But hand write notes aren't highlighted perfectly by this application. But honestly I like this application & you have to use it one time for highlighting documents & notes (only typepad).👍👍👍👍👍🙏
It was one of the good pdf reader after samsung notes but I couldn't highlights in samsung notes but in this I easily could highlights what I want .
"Even after setting acroform button properties to ""Visible but doesn't print"", they're still getting printed via Acrobat Mobile"
"Just so secure,never had a problem & knowing all your data there,is safe and secure is a big weight off your mind."
"Awesome! Acrobat Reader has some excellent features, particularly with the premium registration. It's best for editing and enhancing, transforming, and creating PDFs - whatever you can require and a lot more!"
It's very helpful and friendly app. Now a days lot of files I am receiving are in pdf formats and this app makes it easy to reading.
"I'm extremely delighted with the application. With a costs membership you can make use of Acrobat Viewers as a PDF editor to edit text and photos, a PDF converter to export to and also from PDF, or make use of various other sophisticated features to create PDFs, integrate PDF records, arrange PDFs, as well as extra. This app is a must-have for anyone who needs to create or edit PDFs."
"Incredible! It's so useful to be able to check out PDFs on the go. The application is also really easy to use, and it's wonderful that you can keep your data online. I most definitely advise this application to anybody who wants to review PDFs!"
it's a great app. My only suggestion would be to incorporate a feature of making folders for files. It becomes easy to access. Refer to Microsoft notes for reference.
"It was ok, I didn't care for the price to use all of the features though. Not pocketbook friendly."
It's so easy and shows my documents clear and it works wonders for me now I don't know if still going to change because I started to use it today
user friendly in my opinion as a senior member of the society. Always use to scan documents when uploading to complete online applications.
Very functional app has a cool function called liquid mode doesn't necessarily work with everything the really cool when it does-1 star for not being more intuitive seeing as how some documents open in the after Equity it would be nice to be able to change the file name from the app small stuff like that
"Glad to use Adobe for free. Would prefer to NOT use the file ""manager."" Specifically, whenever I close a pdf file on Android, I land on a list of pdf files that are on my device. Not helpful."
"Absolutely amazing, but I have a compalin though. Some documents can't be veiwed in mobile view. Thank you."
"Is is good, but Twitter still has room for improvement. The ""spaces"" feature providing an opportunity for ""regular people"" to be involved in meaningful conversation is very unique, but still needs some development work as the feature is quite buggy. Beyond that, this is a great app for open-minded individuals with a genuine desire to learn or contribute"
"Overall I'd say Twitter is a satisfactory app for what it is. There is a lot to love about this app that is worth checking out, but I'm going to offer just a couple of suggestions for things I'd like to see. First, audio playback from a video without opening the video in fullscreen. Second, a non-disappearing option to go to the top of the Home feed. Third, the ability to download/save GIFs from posts."
"The best social media platform imo. Faster and more compact than Instagram, more sophisticated than Facebook, and all around a very balanced app. News, world wide events and customizable interests interact so seamlessly with the user. The one flaw is that it can be somewhat difficult to use for those who are bad when dealing with technology. Regardless, it's still very organized and uniform."
"This APP does Twitter nicely! I like the options for Twitter Spaces, which I use regularly. I do wish we could customize the font color, but it's more of a personal liking an isn't really important or necessary for proper usage. The APP does crash every so often, but no more than it did when I was using the web version! However it restores itself immediately after any crashes and I'm able to jump right back to where I left off without losing my place. Overall, I'm satisfied with this APP!"
"I'm surprised twitter hasn't asked me to rate them until now. I've been using the app for several years now. sometimes randomly glitchy, usually runs pretty smoothly. they often change things and it's usually something dumb. like moving the 'send' button from the bottom, where it made sense and was comfortable, to the top. I like the feature where I can limit who can reply."
If not for the random freezes it would be a 5. I have learned to uninstall and reinstall every couple of weeks. The latest version just crashes and quits more often than freezing. I actually like that better. I do wish there was a way to completely turn off DMs. You call them messages. I believe a very significant percentage of users would like to eliminate this very annoying feature. It is used primarily by scammers.
"Twitter is a great place from my experience! Artists, blogs, and news alike all in one place. It's great! I'd give all five stars... if I could access it at the moment. Your latest patch, for Android, was supposed to fix the bug that crashed the app, and it didn't do a thing to help. It'll go in for barely a second before showing the same error as the other times ""Twitter has stopped"", so this is my report. If I can go back in, I'd happily add that 5th star."
I've been using Twitter for years and I prefer it over the long rants on Facebook. But some of the controls and features are obscure and difficult to puzzle through. Example: I have 30+ years experience working with all kinds of software. Yet it took me *months* to figure out how to send Direct Messages on Twitter. Basic controls like that should be intuitive.
"The app works pretty fine and shows the content correctly. But there are some hiccups here and there. Sometimes the video fails to play by itself. When you touch a notification, it takes some time to open the post. Just the whole responsiveness of the app needs to be addressed... Thank You."
"It's as good as it can be I suppose, but not perfect. For some reason which I do not understand nor care to debug, occasionally when I start to identify someone with @, the app plugs in a previous used name (from months ago!) and will not allow me to backspace it, highlight it, or in anyway edit it, and I have to delete the tweet. This forces me to re-enter the the text and the name without the @ symbol, complete the text, and then add the @ symbol. It's very irritating. Android 7, lg rebel 3."
"Great app overall, but there is a bug with Android, or at least Google Pixels. When I post any media, it blocks it as sensitive content and I have to click ""view"" to see my own pictures. This doesn't happen when I look at other accounts, only my own. I use Twitter for my business, so this got annoying very quickly. It's been happening for at least a year."
"Great Edit: Has had an issue I've experienced with no other app, it would crash each time I attempted to run it, even after rebooting the phone, etc. After a re-install, it worked again. Maybe corrupted cache. Not too serious, but you'd think one of the most used apps out there'd be more stable 'n a ton of random freeware ones I use all the time. Still great, but not perfect."
"Really enjoy the app, but I'm getting really sick of two big issues. Auto-refreshing and the ""Home"" feature being automatically re-enabled. I would prefer it if you could permanently toggle between Home and Latest Tweets, but the stupid app keeps automatically re-enabling Home. No I don't want to see top tweets first, I want to see the latest and most current when I want to see them. If I haven't refreshed yet, then I should be able to stay where I'm at without being forced to scroll up."
"One of the best social media apps! It runs very smoothly, has a nice selection of features and is pretty simple to sign up for. My only problems with it is that with the android version you can't put multiple images into one tweet and if you post a video it will trim off the last second or so so if your video has a last minute joke it's ruined. Overall I'd reccomend it they just should fix some small things."
"I'd give 5 stars, but for some reason, every couple of weeks, the app freezes up. I have to Uninstaller and reinstall. Elon is doing a great job of making Twitter a better experience. I just wish there were better options for not seeing sexual content. It would be ESPECIALLY WONDERFUL to have separate lists for those followed and not followed. Difficult to go through my list."
This most recent update has fixed a lot of issues and added some much needed change to Twitter. Now it feels more personal with extra emoji reactions and it's easier to reply to certain people to avoid confusion which is great for group chats. There is still the occasional DM glitch here and there or Twitter just freezes but those are minor issues compared to before.
"update: 4 stars. the bug must've gotten fixed. the app runs pretty good, but still glitches out, occasionally promts me to save or delete posts that aren't mine when I click on pictures to zoom or heart them. I occasionally use app, when I do use twitter I have to log in almost every time I open it. Even if I was just on it a few minutes ago. Super annoying and makes me want to delete."
"Twitter for Android has improved massively since Elon Musk took over. It's been 2 months since Twitter has been running very smoothly and is much faster than it ever was. 2 particular issues i have been having are; when i clear my search history, everything goes dark and i have to close Twitter and reopen it for it to work again and when i open a video and tap to hide the play/stop bar, it won't resbow again when i tap on the video."
I think there's a bug when playing a video on newsfeed. At first play of video It doesn't start just stuck even tho i have a good connection. I always need to go back to the feed then open the video again to play... I wish there's a delete all tweets or mark a multiple of tweet post to delete. thank you. and godbless elon musk and all the employee.
It's a great app for keeping up with the matters that I required but I think there should be an option to check the posts/tweets according to the year or date We can't see all tweets if there are too many and that makes it hard to find some particular tweets if wanted.. if this issue could be fixed it would be great But it's overall a great app
"Really enjoy elons upgrades and fixes. One thing I wish would change to add the 5th star is I don't like that my feed refreshes to the top when I close and reopen the app. I prefer to scroll through backwards and if I want to get to the top there is a button for that, it shouldn't go up automatically"
"Twitter's recent Android video player update is a major disappointment! The progress bar disappears while watching, and it doesn't come back when you touch the screen, making it impossible to track video progress. No fast forward or rewind option either."
"The official version has very big bugs. I can't browse other people's tweets normally, and viewing comments or content will bring me back to the first page. It really bothers me. I hope your team can optimize it as soon as possible, including stuttering animations when swiping"
The nudity is worth it! The only annoying things are character limit and no one really follows back and the sea of dead bot replies. I do appreciate the freedom of expression no other app I know of allows like nudity and language. I have found myself more on Twitter since I discovered this.
"The navigation could be improved. It's unpredictable getting to where you left off. It feeds forward when you log-in and you can't find what you saw. Obviously, there's all kinds of improvements that could be built in for personalization. But, it's a free app. So, we use what we have...WF"
I really love this app! I gained 174 followers in just a month! But there is some problems with it. 1. Blue twitter cost so much money to buy it and to make things even worse is that if you need a premium month you need yo pay an extra money to buy it. Not only that Is in 2. The videos are a bit low graphics But still this app is the best!
"Almost perfect. I wish that there was an option to save your key phrase searches directly as topics to follow, and where possible to translate these into corresponding hashtags 6o follow. Something in the style of Google alerts."
Its improved a fair bit since the change in management with better fact checking and political equality but could still use some polish in the ways of it bugs out on my phone having to reinstall (rarely) and some features I shouldn't have to pay for as a standard feature like editing but the app is still great for my social media networking and that's my main use so good app overall.
Pretty good app overall. I don't like stone of the content that shows up on my timeliness but there are options to not view it so that's good. I like the format and font it very user friendly. One thing I would like back is the ability to direct post when you click on the sports tab while searching
"On my phone, I used to be able to copy a tweet with a link in it and paste it into a new tweet. For a while now, when I try that, the link does not copy properly and doesn't work. However, I can copy/paste tweets on a computer. I wish Twitter could allow copy/paste of links on phones agai."
"Twitter is a great, I like the changes and how the app stays dinamic and the interest for making information transparent. The feature of adding context to a tweet is just super! The only negative is that the feed acts of very often. I check a tweet and when I go back to the feed it updates or something and the thread is lost."
"Even though the app is seemingly safe it is easy for it to be broken or breached and compromised. Regardless of the precautions, ""it"" comes so sudden. The app is fine, seemingly harmless. Just be careful of what I kept repeating. Prepare yourself once it happens. Oh! And not only this app/social media. Any app or place can lead to that breach problem. Just be careful if you click obvious suspicious links. The problem I said previously? That's so sudden that it cannot be avoided."
"Twitter was all good until installed the update. Now can't use the app because it won't open. After tapping the app, it would appear like it is trying to open. But aftera few seconds, it would close automatically and an error message ""unfortunately, Twitter has stopped"" would appear."
"Previously it used to be easy to copy a tweet just by tapping firmly but the feature is no longer available, and now even if the select all feature is tapped, the entire tweeted message including the website link is not selected and copied! Besides, there used to be an option to connect a new tweet to become a part of an older thread which is also not available!"
"This version (9.80.0-release.0) of Twitter for Android still doesn't seem to display any 4K images even when the corresponding setting is switched on (in “Settings and privacy” → “Accessibility, display and languages” → “Data usage” → “High-quality images” → “Mobile data & Wi-Fi”) and “Data saver” is off. Thus large screenshots of text (3000—4000 pixels long) sometimes look unintelligible and they never support any real zoom."
Update - It fine now the previous feature इस back and I loved it Since morning videos are not been played auto I need to click the post then play button.. Previous one was good you just need to tap on the video to play.. The pip mode was awesome even that is removed
"Since recently, whenever I like a video on Twitter during it playing, the audio gets muted. And I have no option to get it back other than exiting the page. The ""For you"" shows all the irrelevant tweets from all the irrelevant people and switching to Following section is not automatic. Getting bored of Twitter after 15 years of usage."
"I love Twitter. It helps connect me with people in increasingly advanced ways that have given me more and more benefits and satisfaction along the way. Yeah there's room for improvement like all apps so I don't give 5 stars yet, but it's getting close. I've gotten so much support lately via Twitter as it directs me with excellent accuracy towards the parts of the noosphere I need and want to be part of at that very moment. Thx to devs, E and team, and the artists and creators who sustain it! 🏹"
"Having been bounced into using this app after happily using Talon, I'm finding the official Twitter app works fine for me. The order of tweets in my feed baffles me for the moment, but it's no worse than the most recent at the top. I wonder if there's a way to pay not to see ads."
"I just found out that there are 18+ contents on twitter and I am not happy about it. And, the connection has to be so good to watch video etc while in YouTube or other apps wifi with normal speed works just fine!"
"it's a good app although when I'm reading the tweet restarts and when im scrolling thru my twt it always restart, please fix it. and can you add a new feature where you can add folders on your bookmark so you can easily find your bookmark and you dont need to scroll many times."
"Okay the latest update sucks, we can't see posts from what we follow, so what's the purpose of following accounts if we can't see them in our timeline? Are you trying to self destruct like Instagram? Edit: it's great. It's just that your tweets won't see the light of the day."
"Needs improvement. Clicking 'back' exits the app. When liking a video, it mutes it. Notifications from people I don't follow. Several Bots follow me every day. Twitter has no support team, hence I'm posting here. Twitter's news isn't on it and I read them on TLDR emails. Still needs to work on becoming A source of unbiased news, except for Simon Ateba. So much chaos."
Great experience with it! Been at it constantly for a few years. I like the feature where you can browse without signing in now. Paid sub has extra perks.
"It's needs more functions like Facebook, where we are able to view back the old photos with 1 tab. It needs to be active on support especially when i need help to report on scammers giving Fake recommendation on Reviving Disabled Facebook Account which is impossible as there are many of them who are Fake accounts."
"I love the new community notes thing. It helps to show when people aren't being honest and gives context about the topic at hand. I don't think ANYONE should be given a free blue checkmark. The whole point is to make every equal I thought but some celebs and ""elites"" got a free blue checkmark. There's no AS MUCH bias against right wing ideas and opinions but it's still not an equal playing field for all to speak freely. But overall it's miles better than it was before Elon."
Got my Blue Check Mark. Yay. But I still can't go over the 280 letter cut off. Supposed to be getting that 4000 letters. And also it says I have 30 minutes to edit my tweet and can't do that either. All while paying 11.99 a month. Fix issues and it's easily 5 stars.
"Fun app. Interesting articles and interesting people. A crucible of ideas that spark real conversations and examination. There is no shortage of trolls (unhelpful dolts), but there's also plenty of thoughtful individuals."
"this app is amazing but the thing is that it sometimes does allow to create a gc or like view or save the pictures sent in dms, i would say that this issue needs to be fixed soon. overall the app is really good."
"too many changes all the time. used to be stable, and you knew how to do things. Now it changes every few days. things popping up, moving, scrolling.... bleugh...."
Lately when I try to see the people who followed on the conversation it does not work. I did clear cache and then uninstalled and reinstalled it to no avail. I see people commenting that it is the Android app. That's the problem.
"The Old Twitter was an Free and Open Platform, and that made it great, but also valuable, so they sold it! Now it's Elon's to do what He wishes with. So not wanting to be an unwelcome 'Guest' I now pay for a Service. This establishes Terms and Conditions both ways. It's the nearest thing to Equity still available. I enjoy the 'News' and the odd Laugh it brings and the ability to shout out into the Void. I would miss it if It went, but the whole M.O. of Twitter has changed."
Good job on the bookmark button. The video interface is still not good though. The toggle does not work consistently.
"4 is a great score 5 is perfection I can't watch videos Fullscreen. That'll cause the Twitter page to default to top, regardless of how much scrolling was done. So four stars, good app."
"It is good and very useful for me to keep on update with the latest news , but unfortunately I'm still have some problem with my home feed . Where is my home feed is always automatically refresh by itself , whenever I want to tap on a tweet that I interested . Then its so hard for me to find back the tweet that's I want to . Hopefully, all the developers and designers notice my big pleasure and feedback. I'd hope for the best . That's all. Sincerely yours User, Shahqilzz"
"Most of the time, it feeds me content I'm interested in. With Facebook, I was constantly fed abhorrent fascist views, so I stopped logging on. There are still opposing views to be seen, so it's not a total spiral of reinforcement. There's loads of harmless fluffiness about dogs, especially my breed of choice, so it learns well, especially as it leaves cats out of it. There was talk of mass exodus, which happily hasn't happened, as yet. However, allowing publication of fake news worries me"
"When I get a notification of a tweet from someone I am following and click on the icon for the account, it starts with earlier tweets. I reckon it would help if the latest tweets showed first. Or maybe include a feature that allows the latest tweets at the top? If the app, intermittently, won't load up, go to settings and clear the cache for the app. I like the dark mode."
"I think there should be an option where when one changes password, the new password should be sent to the linked mobile number and email. And also when an email is been changed the email should be sent to both the email and password. And they shouldn't allow email and password change at consecutive moments. It will help reduce people's account getting compromised"
So far keeps getting better. I've had Twitter since it came out until they started kicking ppl off then I left. But I'm back like many and have used it 1000x more than I ever did before. Continue to notice drastic improvements on a weekly basis. Makes me disappointed I don't have stock of it anymore.
"I like it for the most part. It really only lacks two things: the ability to edit my recent tweets, and a good filter for inappropriate images."
"I like that the mobile app's home feed has finite scrolling and so far find the features and performance of the app satisfactory. In terms of ads, after playing around with the privacy features, it probably remains the least spammy of my social media apps - however, I noted that I can't have the same accessibility features (notably the high contrast feature) that is available on the browser version."
Good app except for the bookmarks feature. Need to be able to organize them and search them because they become pretty useless once you have a lot of them.
"The reason that I give it a four is because I made my email address and it said""this email had already been taken"" and I was using my old account and it did work and now I'dk how I'm going to get the code but it was a nice app nothing was wrong with it but only because that happened and I will like for that someone that copied my email to get there own email"
"the app is getting better , but I do not like the feed system. I want to see everything not what ai thinks I want to see. other than that, great job to staff that was cut in half after Mr Elon fired alot of ppl. I see more improvement so I'm sure he can take this app to new heights. I feel like he knows that the app is about the people not the celebrities."
I believe that Twitter has gotten a bit better since Elon musk acquired it. The platform can still use some upgrades such as a larger reach with algorithms. Blue check marks should be earned and not bought. I also believe that people that have more than a thousand followers should be eligible for monetization. In all of that being said the platform has greatly improved. Less censorship and more communication.
Need to fix the spaces. Some can't come up to speak.. almost like they Censoring people. Need to definitely add more features to Spaces. Cause spaces is alright but it does need an upgrade. Most definitely.
Please give the option to save video into phone gallery like images facility you provided. It will be good helpful. And provide the option to not see specific content like spots or any other category content.
"Big lag on galaxy s22+ update the app already! Update... 3-15-22 still runs like hot garbage on galaxy s22+ 4-25-22 Still a laggy mess on Galaxy s22+. 11-10-22 still lags when scrolling. 1-20-23 still has scroll lag on Galaxy s22+. 5/9/23 Finally excetable performance on my galaxy s22+ thanks, Elon and the android dev team!"
Twitter needs to make it when you're app closes because of being android You can use their SEARCH for assistance I finally thought of googling issue and found out what was going on Because contacting Twitter didn't help because everytime I went to click SEND on Twitter help ..the app closed 😂
Easily accessible the latest news and researches and opinions of experts. Smooth interface.
"Twitter has a bit of a ""wild west"" vibe these days, but the app is good. It could be a lot more intuitive, and they have weird rules about how many people you can follow. Still the place to be in the Social Media world. There are still people there who matter."
"They broke it, now anytime I try to post a tweet, the app crashes/closes. Never had this problem before. Also replying to others tweets the app doesn't post the reply. Lots of improvements going on but now we need to get back to basics and fix the easy stuff"
In a positive perspective! It is wonderful as a means of communication and knowledge and sharing. Unfortunately it's use has spilled over to a negative Domain especially Political perspectives. The App in my view can become more valuable without the other perspectives.
"It was good when i used it before but this days, there are some failure that i experience. Like when i'm going to bookmark a post, it won't save even though I press the bookmark many times. So I hope this can ba fixed."
"It's still a fixer upper. But I like it better than fb, I can tell you that much. Though, I'd prefer less of a feeling of competing for attention on what I do and what I stand for. But overall.. decent entertainment 😉"
I like it because you can see what you want to without a whole lot of drama and just scroll through what you want to. I've been happy with this app. There's risk to everything but you can interact with others that have the same interests you do.
"Working great. Only issue is that in dark/dim mode the text is not visible on the follow, following and promote button."
"All good so far, though I occasionally receive notification from people and content i have no interest in. I will recommend to ask users if they like a content when it is not coming from their following."
"Twitter is the best social media app for staying updated on what’s happening around the world. You can join the conversation with sound, live audio conversations that amplify the power of the human voice. You can also follow your interests, share your opinions, and interact with influencers and friends. Twitter is fast, easy to use, and data-friendly. Whether you want to catch up on news, sports, entertainment, or politics, Twitter has it all. Download it now and join the Twitter community! 🐦"
"Elon is a beast, but a beast from heaven. Lacking in some features such as long form videos go back to the beginning if I leave the app."
"It would be nice to be able to edit. Also, I need more characters. It's nice to finally be able to say anything at all that the left does not approve of without being permanently suspended. Thanks, Elon. 🤘😎🎸"
"I think what Elon did to this App, and for it's users (all while also helping the sounds/voices of everyone who can access Twitter to be heard, and to matter) is nothing short of an indefinite blessing. 1 crit if I may: I find myself wishing I could add more to my posts, or unfortunately needing to find ways to shorten it with less intellectual spellings, #s, or abbreviations that makes me feel like I did not get the most definitive point across. Here, as I write my comments, there's no problem"
I'm giving 4 stars. Cuz it hangs everytime I try to make a space. My messages are received late. Not on proper timing. There is always a glitch in message box and my all notifications are also not shown.
Everything else is fine but plz fix the video player ASAP. I probably don't need to tell you what the issue is. If you don't understand then please read others' comments to find out what's wrong with the video player.
"Seems like it's changing all the time. After Musk took over, it was changing too often. Things seem to have stabilized more now. My favorite place for Civil Discourse on Politics."
"Twitter is great for keeping in contact with everyone but I find, particularly with the anonymity bit, it's not all about protecting people's identity, it's often about people trying to get away with being as toxic, trolling, stalking and doxxing as they can. Still, the platform bit I do quite like. I'm not sure what the actual benefits of the blue tick are now though, so I can't justify that much a month."
"Is a good app. Except for the fact that the Devs are wanting to take the 2-factor off for basic users & are ONLY giving it to the Twitter Blue users now. Which is total BS btw! The 2-factor should be for ALLLL users! I'm NOT paying $10 bucks a frikkin month for that! That's insane! If it was only $0.99, then maybe."
"great app but i suggest have a timeline for us to go back on old tweets or something like memories for each day. i'm sure that would be useful and i'll rate it back to 5 stars. i appreciate this app anws, thanks ♡"
"Intuitive, easy to use. The best app in the internet where the world meet. Keep it up and going. However allow for more freedom"
I like the fact that you can set people straight when you have real facts and not just follow some news stations giving you half the story. The only thing is it doesn't give you much writing time
My only app improvement suggestion would be to allow me to read the entire tween without having to click more like I can when I'm in a browser.
"Every time I pressed back to close a reply, the page is automatically scrolled to the main tweet. It is annoying especially on a long thread. You have to fix this."
"At times the application lag or delay will recalculate what I'm seeing next, it'll be something I'm interested in, but I won't see it again until scrolling another five to 10 messages."
"It is very easy to use. With the for you feed, it doesn't seem as recent as I would want to see. Also, I don't want to ""connect with friends."" I just want to see funny things and news/current events."
Well its a very good app and i can get any info bout the world but the notifications dont come up from the profiles i follow even tho i hvae turned on my notifications so i think it should be modified asap
"Slightly difficult to navigate. When I select ""following"" it still shows me tweets from those I don't follow... Maybe I just don't know what I'm doing? 🤷🏼‍♀️"
"It's a powerful tool to engage with researchers. Unfortunately, the algorithm have been modified and currently it does not update frequently how it used to be."
"very great app, user friendly, notificationss, and stuff to scroll through when bored. there are no glitches or lag, and you can keep up with whats happening."
"The current update does not allow taping on the screen to playback or play forward a video, it prompts to liking the video"
I'm using from past 3-4 years It is quit good experience! Nowdays Phone's Most Used App! ......... Editing after 2-3 weeks.. Whats this horrible video mode now? Nowadays it takes too mach time to load an page....
"SoundCloud has actually constantly been an amazing platform for discovering new music and also searching for trending musicians. With its new Discover feature, it has come to be a lot more crucial to be a SoundCloud individual. The new format makes it simpler to find what you're trying to find, whether you're trying to find brand-new music to add to your playlists or simply wish to look into some of the most up to date tracks from your favorite musicians."
"So despite ads, which is someone everyone hates, I've been using this app for a very long time, but I can see you removed a function that lets you remove songs from your made up playlist when you click ""Add To Playlist."" Now I can only remove songs from the playlist by actually going through the playlist. The other way was more quick and easier. Please bring it back!"
I like it. It has a lot of song options and the comment section feature is fun to read through. Only issue is that sometimes app buffers in the middle of the song making me exit the app and returning (its not the biggest issue but kinda annoying). Also most of the popular songs are locked behind premium (go+) but most of the time another account will upload the song for free so it's not that big of a deal.
"The app itself is amazing due to the amazing amount of fresh music available. I have a couple of significant usability issues though: first, the next up list sorting is buggy as hell with the item you selected to sort being the one sorted about 75% of the time. Other times it just chooses a different list item near it and sorts that making it impossible at times to actually sort the lost to your liking. Second, I hate that clicking a SC link or starting a new track wrecks my next up list."
Everything has been great up until a week ago my songs keep freezing almost after every single song. When the next song comes up it just sits there and doesn't play wich bassicly makes me have to press play for every song wich you could imagine is VERY annoying. The app would be almost perfect if that could be fixed. It's been some time now and it still happening and the ads are absolutely ridiculous
"like all the other reviewers, the app will play a few songs and stop. i haven't tried the methods other users used because there is no good outcome. but regardless, app used to be better. it'll play 1-4 songs, sometimes stopping multiple times in between, then completely stop playing music all together. it'll also say that my phone isn't connected to any internet, meanwhile it will be. ive been using this app for years and it's basically never done this. please fix in your next update."
"its great for listening to music i use it all the time, i have 2 problems though, the ads which arent so bad because you need them to help make money but i get them after listening to the first song i put on. now the next one, this one really annoys me, it plays random songs that arent on my playlist and i just dont want to listen to new songs since then I'll have to skip them when i just started to sleep to music. so please make a feature without making us to pay to stop playing random songs"
"I really like Soundcloud. I've been using it for a few years now and it's become my main go-to for music of all kinds. The only downside is the ads can be a little annoying (two ads playing back-to-back, ads in a random language like french, etc.). Otherwise I love soundcloud and will probably keep using it for many years to come!"
"I do absolutely love SoundCloud, especially as one working in the audio industry. It is a great place to find new musicians or any other audio related talent. If the UI were a bit less... ""confusingly redundant"" and missing the key features for the Pro Artist tier it would be 6 stars. Honestly if it just had the same layout as the web version on the up next list rather than the full screen with a tiny menu view and less capability it'd be an auto 5 no matter who you are. Love you SoundCloud!"
"I'm a bit confused at this point. I was riding this bus free. Every hour or so, the music would stop and 5 bells would ring then the music would start again. Also, there were many tracks I couldn't access. So I joined SoundCloud go. When I joined the site stated I would get access to all tracks. Now it states I have to upgrade the SoundCloud Plus to access all tracks but the tracks I can't access state Not Available in Your Country. This app was better when it was free."
"I love this app. But lately, it's been unable to play tracks that I've had saved for years. I've tried updating, clearing everything, and it hasn't helped much. I use to think it was the signal, but even on my solid wifi it's been slacking to play tracks (including go+). Fingers crossed y'all figure it out so I can groove uninterrupted 🤞🤙"
"Recently audio from songs will just stop completely, no rhyme or reason, and the song is still playing because I see the dot moving across the line and going to the previous song and then back makes the audio come back. I'll bump this to a 5 star when the issue is fixed as it is annoying, I thought something was wrong with my phone at first."
"I love this app I've used it for years but recently anytime I'm organizing songs in a play list I move it up to one spot but then it'll glitch and move back down to where it was. It's really really annoying. Also the editing playlist feature it a little awkward to use, before you could hold the song near the top of the screen to move it up but you can't now 😕."
"Great for finding rare or unreleased songs by your favorite artists, has songs that YouTube, Spotify, and Pandora don't have. You can listen to any song you wish without paying for the subscription, unlike Spotify or Pandora, where you have to shuffle a playlist and hope you find the song before you run out of skips. Only downside is that a lot of mainstream music may be marked as go+ (meaning you need a subscription), but you can always find another account that posted the same song for free"
I was able to find a lot of new interesting artists and so far my experiences with this app are pretty good. I like that your able to follow an artists profile and make playlists and its pretty easy to use and navigate. The playlist based on the stuff you listen to tends to be a hit or miss but its a fun idea to listen to new music. I have noticed that there has been an increase of pretty rancid and nasty immature comments i used to love reading the comments its sad to see what its become.
"It's a pretty good app for listening to music, but I think the recent update has a bug that conflicts with my phone. Whenever I play music on soundcloud the waveform doesn't open & I get two different notifications for it. The usual one that's supposed to let skip to anypart of the song but only shows the song as paused and a new one the only let's me pause & go to the next and previous songs. Edit: I just used soundcloud after a few days & I think it's finally gone."
"App streaming is great, and I really appreciate what the platform offers. My only feedback would be that the Android App I have access to does not have a clear link to see (or even know about) direct messaging from other Sound Cloud users. Otherwise I like the app and I use it often, and more importantly I love the platform and the access to underground and independent music it offers."
Great app . works very well. could use less ads. the service is always wanting the user to upgrade. I think artist posting their own music should not have to be subject to as much SoundCloud own promotional b.s. We provide content and SoundCloud want us to pay to get some additional recognition. The app doesn't always go well over in Facebook cause switching platforms isn't working/appropriate for a lot of users who just want to hear the song posted. not be switching platforms. still very good.
"It's a good app, it allows me to listen to the songs I enjoy and new artist I didn't know about. But sometimes it gets glitchy and while I'm listening to a song, a random ad will show up, making me have to click back on it and sometimes the ads still pop up even though i just watched one. It can get buggy sometimes but all in all, I would honestly prefer it over spotify because it allows me to find new things"
"Great app! Very useful for listening to music and finidng new songs and creators. One issue is that you can't make playlists unlisted or only available to specific users. I have a couple playlists I would like for my friends to be able to listen to but I don't want to set it to public so that everyone can listen to it. It would be helpful if there was an unlisted option alongside private and public. One more thing is the limit of 500 tracks per playlist, it's no too bad though."
"It is a great app. It has a lot of options and features all for (pretty much) free. I especially like how you can find songs and add them to custom playlists. However, the ads are just horribly obnoxious. Every song in my playlist plays an ad after it by now; it's just gotten worse over time. I do like using it, but would it kill them to cool it on the ads a bit?"
"Good stuff: Browsing music and making playlists is a breeze, and the autoplay and suggested playlists are some of the best and smartest you can ask for. I can put on an auto-generated playlist and listen to new music for hours and never hear something I don't like. Issues: pausing in the background for more than about a minute causes the notification bar to disappear. The 'Add to Next Up' feature doesn't work for playlists anymore? What happened? The option is still there, but it doesn't do anything."
"the music is great, the quality is great, the interface could use some work. For example, when you are in landscape, it's nearly impossible to hit the add to next button. More often than not you'll hit play now instead which ruins your playlist. also, stop playing similar tracks when the current one is over. That is so annoying. Give us an option at least."
"Really like the app, good for a lot of small artists. I've only had one issue, however it's a recurring one. Sometimes I'll click on a song and it won't play it. But it will automatically skip to the next song. to get the song I want to actually play, I have to tap several times for it to play. Or even have to force stop the app. Google Pixel XL 2"
"It's an amazing app over all. I would like some help on a small issue, however. Why is it that shuffle play only works when I'm charging my phone? Connected, the songs play continuously with only periodic interruption by ads and don't stop. Disconnected, however, the songs will not play without pauses every so often in a single song, and I will have to reopen my phone and press pause and play to get the song to play again. This happens when I'm connected to Wi-Fi as well. Please help! Other than this, it's an awesome music streaming app that I've had for almost 3 years now!"
"I love this app. Great music, the majority of which is very easy to listen. My only problem is the adds; not the fact that there is ads, but how many there are. It was ok before, but for some reason there's now an ad after every single song. I'm not saying get rid of the ads though, I'm saying too (at least) have shorter ads as the current length as how current amount of ads can get very frustrating. (I'm sorry for any grammatical errors.)"
"SoundCloud is perfect for people who want to listen to music while doing other things on their phone, but don't want to download songs or pay for YouTube Premium. It's been my go-to music app during drawing for the last few years. My only minor annoyance are the ads, not because they're there, but because you can't do anything when an ad pops up. You're forced into a screen and have to stare at an image for 30 or so seconds."
"For what it's worth, it's a whole lot better than Spotify. The ads can get annoying, yes, but for what you download, it's a good tradeoff. But the shuffle function needs major improvement. It's not random, only switching a few songs than if you just had it on in order play, and if you have say 200 songs in a playlist, it'll only play 10-12 out of that group."
"Great music app. Way better than Spotify at this point. But the ads get annoying. You can only listen to three songs, you get two ads, and it repeats. Some songs you can't listen to because of the pay wall. And sometimes when I pause a song, the notification disappears, making me go back to the app to play the next song on my playlist. But for the life of me I am not getting Spotify again, so I'm keeping this for a while."
"There's a lot of good artists on this platform. People who are worthy of recognition. No, they're not Soundcloud rappers. The app is fairly easy to use, though it can be iffy at times. For example, the simple ""back, play/pause, next song"" controls no longer show up on my phone unless I am in the app. It's pretty annoying when switching between texting and listening to music."
"Really good app, but could you provide some type of button that replays the song automatically for you? Because sometimes I just want to listen to that one song for a bit, and it's a little tiresome/bothersome to have to head back to the app to do it again for you. And it would be nice if there was some sort of limit to ads, like maybe 2 or 3 songs before another ad starts back up, Because ads can also be a bit annoying, song after song. Other than that, really good app."
"soundcloud is a great free music app. i use this to find mostly all of my songs if they are available. i do get quite upset when you can't find a song, or you can't listen to songs without go+. sometimes when i am listening to music, it just turns off and i have to go back into the app, and turn the music back on. this can be very annoying, but i just deal with it. other than a few problems the app is very good overall"
"Honestly, this is a pretty great way to listen to music as it's free and anyone can listen to or upload basically anything. I've used it for years. However, my problem is the ads. Every single ad I've seen has been a 30 second unskippable ad, and often you have 2 back to back. The length of these ads is just utterly annoying. Other than that it's a wonderful way to start sharing your music, or playing songs you like."
"From a lurker, this is a really good app. It's diverse selection of music made by the community is great. The only problems are some playlist and playback problems. If you were to add a track to a playlist, it won't appear until the playlist is refreshed. Sometimes tracks get stuck and replay from a set point of a track. The ads are also... a bit misplaced? Like, I'm getting ads in foreign languages or ads meant for Pandora listeners. Other than those problems, it's really good."
"I really like the service, and what it offers for both musicians and customers. It can, however, be difficult to fully understand, and customize. I've been trying for over two years to upload and change the profile pic. I've contacted support with no response. There also appears to be no ""stop"" function. Even when I leave the page, it continues to play. I'd love to sell music on SoundCloud too. Still, love the product."
"I love this app, super great. I can handle all the adds and junk. It's fine, but what I can't stand and why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that when my phone screen isn't on the music like, makes glitch sounds and it just sounds awful. It's incredibly annoying. It doesn't do this with ANYTHING else. It's not my phone, it's the app. And it only does this when the screen is off. Please please please fix this. I'll rate it 5 stars if this gets fixed!!"
"A great app overall. However, there are multiple problems I have with the app. 1. If you are looking for a specific niche genre of music, this app is not for you. Copyrighted music are either low quality rips, pay to listen, or a bad remix. It's not Soundcloud's fault, but it's still frustrating. 2. There is no way to organize tracks with preformance related filters. That means you are never guarenteed to find and organize tracks by your plays."
"I have used SoundCloud for the past 10 years or so (since 2012) and have amassed 2 big Playlist on there for electronic music. I found 2 of my all time favorite artist on SoundCloud and dont really have any complaints. Its one of the few apps that is actually really solid imo doesn't glitch, doesn't crash. The ads are only frustrating because you cannot do anything until they're done playing. I would like to see in the future maybe be able to ""add"" a next up so the ads still can play."
"Pretty good music App, I've been using it for more than half a year now, you can find good music. Sadly, sometimes Soundcloud has a habit of making the audio horrible, or too quiet. As well as must of the popular lyric musics are behind a 10 dollar a month Paywall, and it's necessary to buy at least Go, as the ad's are usually 30 seconds long, and you get them one after another. As I stated, it's a good app, but has some problems."
"I've been using SoundCloud for 2 or 3 years now. Overall, it's been pretty good although I've noticed some changes over the years. Slowly there's been more ads added and more ""you need the unlimited version to listen to-"" when this app was, or what I originally thought, a way to listen to music 'free' Either way, it still works well and is useful. There's plently of artist on there that are up and coming, not to mention lots of covers. I'd recommend seeing that it's still technically free & good"
"Wow. Just Wow! It's so useful and easy to use. The free option isn't bad at all. I can get a lot of alternative/different songs than on Spotify such as musicals, vocaloid, anime ops and soundtracks. It's amazing! Sometimes it cuts out and I have to start the music again, but it's not that often. I'm actually listening to a song while I'm writing this!!! <3"
"Love Soundcloud! Great content, easy to use interface, especially from the notifications bar. 2 notes, though. Minor, but would like to see fixed: 1. The widget is not customizable, so if you have a theme set to your phone, the widget is gaudy. Please add a transparency option and a 5x1 size option. 2. Trying to open the app from the notifications bar is a mess. 4/5 times tapping on the app just closes the notifications bar rather than open the app. Still love this app for my podcasts :)"
It's a great music app! I really love that it lets you specifically select your songs unlike a lot of mobile music apps. As a fan of remixes I really appreciate that you can find more of that on here as well as songs by Indie artist. If I was to have one complaint it's that not a lot of major artists release their music on here but that's not really a falt to the app. overall a great little app.
"I've been using SoundCloud for about a month now, it's great for songs that aren't on Spotify or when you don't have Spotify Premium and want to listen to a song on demand. It had ads which I don't really mind, and a lot of songs are behind a paywall. Which is generally ok because most of the times there's re-uploads, but it's frustrating when there aren't and I have to deal with the downsides of YT music. Overall I only use it to play certain songs once and a while."
"SoundCloud is definitely the best free music player. Seems to have just gotten a new UI that completely overhauls the old one and it's a lot easier use and looks cleaner. Would be five stars but I've noticed that ads are becoming more and more common as the years have gone by. Now we are getting 1 or 2 unskippable ads at a time every 2 or 3 songs which is very annoying, though I have noticed that the longer you listen to music the larger the ad gaps become."
"You can listen to music continuously, for free. Or, you can sample music before buying it. Great sound quality. Easy to use. You can share songs with friends via email easily. Nice variety of genres, generally; however, they could expand it even more. I'm mainly listening to their wonderful selection of ambient albums. But will expand into other areas soon, as well. You can easily create your own playlists to quickly access your favorite albums. Very nice app."
"Personally love everything about SoundCloud but my only complaint has always been the whole ""Not available in your country"" after having heard a song previously with no issue. Don't know any fix to the issue but it can't last for a very long time before certain songs are made available to hear again, or just never again at all. Which usually results in having to find someone else who posted the same song or just bare with the fact that it's not available to listen to until it fixes itself."
"I switched from Spotify because the free version of SoundCloud is better because it has unlimited skips, up next feature, and being able to choose a song, just like a music player should be, like a mp3 player, and overall it's still a upgrade from Spotify but it's annoying when they switch a song that wasn't Go only then do they switch it to Go with no warning at all, and in my case, since I don't want to pay for Go I can't listen to it anymore. I'm not asking to stop it, just give me a warning."
"Sound Cloud is awesome for many reasons, I love how anyone can post and repost their own stuff, it allows for split screen, music can be played without service with or without having the premium account. Love using this app when we go out to the lake and I am the only one who can play music lol. Please don't get rid of this feature. Also love how any song already has a playlist of simular songs ready to go, really helps if I'm trying to change things up. Have had this app for 6 or 7 years now."
"obviously no one likes but I have been a long time user and can say there's no better free app where you can skip unlimited songs, search for songs, exclusives , and of course ads. obviously no one likes them and while there maybe times when you get them over and over, it's still great. as a user, I would suggest implementing a variety. keep up the awesome work all of you do to keep it running 🙏"
"Sound Cloud is ok. It has a LOT of music. The only thing I don't care for is at the bottom of the page it has lines similar to an equalizer that shows how loud sections are. It's completely unnecessary and distracting. I suppose it could help you find a place in a particular song. Overall I just don't use SoundCloud unless I have to. I like YouTube better and some other apps are easier to use. But, I give it 4 stars because it does what it should, play music. 5 if they change things."
"one of the recent updates have been grinding my gears for a bit now. the whole process of adding or removing tracks to a playlist has been messed with in a way that makes it so when you remove a song from a playlist you can't really add it back, similarly when creating playlists one of my gripes have been not being able to change the title of said playlist, especially since now it can get stuck as 'untitled'. I sincerely love this app and would like to see this be solved, thank you."
"I have been using this app for around 2 years and everything were good so far. Until recently there is a bug where the song volume is automatically lower for no reason but my phone volume setting didn't change. I then turn the phone volume up then sometime later the song volume turn back to normal, this keep happening. However, when I stop the song and reset the app, things went back to normal for sometime then the volume problem happen again. Please help me solve this bug! I'm on Pixel 3a."
"Love SoundCloud, and I pay for Go+. It's easy to find new music by following artists I like and letting them repost, and I use it for all my own music as well. That said, this app can get a bit buggy with the play queue. Songs won't reorganize correctly, order gets switched around, and wrong song is displayed while playing. This is more likely to occur the longer app is running. Device: OnePlus Six"
"Great app. Everything works well on it and plays well. Would've given it 5 stars but recently the app itself has issues when it's not the focused app. If you switch to another app and leave SoundCloud running in the background, SoundCloud will crash after a good chunk of time. As long as the app isn't running in the background, it works fine."
"Hello, this is Olivia, I wish I can give your app 5 stars. But it has some problems. First of all, I can't loop playlists, and when my playlist is done it goes to whatever is on the radio which is very annoying, I can't download the music because I have to pay money, and the worst part about it is that this app is literally the only way to listen to the Stellar Fox soundtrack and it's a bummer this amazing soundtrack can only be found on a mediocre music app."
"I love SoundCloud. I use it almost all the time. It's great for people who enjoy discovering small artists, but it's not really for if you're wanting to upload a song on the go. The amount of ads honestly isn't as bad as they say it is, and I live in the US. My only problem is with the latest update. The layout doesn't look good anymore and there's an annoying bug that automatically signs you out whenever you close the app. I hope this get fixed and I hope you can switch to the old style."
"i love listening to music on here, some of the songs i don't have access to like on spotify would be here. but sometimes it would be opposite. also, you should add the edition of being able to change your profile picture, to make it easier on those who don't have a computer. (looking up the website to change it all is an option, but it's frustrating and i don't think people would want to deal with that)."
"This app has so many songs and artists I listen to on Youtube and there are even different versions of said songs that aren't on Youtube. It's quite fun to run into new artists that are just starting and seeing them gradually become more and more well-known. Edit: I'm bumping my rating down to 3 stars because, after the most recent update, the app crashes and gives me an error message every time I try to open it. Please fix this!! Edit 2: Issue resolved, bumped up to four stars."
"Been using this for around 2 years now. It's sufficient and works well enough. Although, I hate when SC randomly crashes and stops playing music and when it goes to a completely random song on my likes playlist when I'm inactive on the app. Not saying you shouldn't get this, it's great for listening to music, but these bugs are really annoying."
"The new adding to Playlist feature is amazing. Except when you remove a song from a playlist, once you do that you can't add it back anymore. It has a check beside the playlist saying it's adding but when you tap it, it only says it has been removed, never added again. It is also NOT in the playlist any longer and you CAN NOT add it back. Only bolded so no confusion. Love soundcloud, just want it fixed. Thank you."
"Everything has been great up until a week ago my songs keep freezing almost after every single song. When the next song comes up it just sits there and doesn't play wich bassicly makes me have to press play for every song wich you could imagine is VERY annoying. The app would be almost perfect if that could be fixed. And to answer your question yes, I stay on top of my updates. Please fix this, thank you."
"There is an agonizing glitch that makes deleted/unplayable songs impossible to unlike due to the app instantly reliking it for you. It's super annoying as it will pause at the song whenever you get to it in your liked playlist, leaving you to manually skip it. Not to mention the double ads are very annoying, though I do understand the need for ads. The good thing about this app is the amazing ""For you"" and ""The upload"" playlists that the app makes for you, allowing you to find similar music. 4/5"
"SoundCloud is a great app. Very useful for finding newer underground music, or using as a platform to distribute your own music. Only problem I have with it is at this point, it seems to be geared 99% towards rap and hip hop. On the main home screen, you won't see anything else as far as music goes. I have no problem with this music, but this used to be something that was geared towards all artists in all genres."
"I love the app, but there's one bug that I really want to get fixed. If a notification comes up the song temporarily lowers itself to let you hear the notification. However, if you pause right before a notification comes up the song is lowered until you close the app and restart it. This actually happens way to frequently for me to pass off. I got a S9 and it's always updated to the latest version, if that helps the dev team."
"I love the app. Your should add a timer feature, where i can set the music to play in a specific amount of time. For example, if i set the timer at 30 minutes, after 30 of playing music, the app will automatic turn off. This will be a really good feature for anyone who listen to music when they are sleeping like me , so that i don't have to worry about the phone battery when i listen to music overnight."
"Have been using SoundCloud for nearly a decade and it has always been great, but lately I am experiencing the same issue as some others here where the app has a bug and music continues to play over other apps and still continues to play when I take a phone call. Other than this issue I love the app. Always have and always will. Once this is fixed I'll change my review to 5 stars! Thanks SoundCloud team for everything over the last 10 years."
"Edit: It's back to normal after uninstalling and reinstalling it. OG: I've been using it for about over a year, and I loved it. But after this recent update, the one big selling point, offline music, is gone. I used to be able to restart my phone, uninstall the app, reinstall it, wait a year, and the last few songs I listened to would still be loaded even without internet, but now it won't even let me listen to a song that's been on repeat for an hour if the connection is broken......."
"I love soundcloud... But recently the song progress chart does not function correctly. The timer is working, but the visual component starts, and stays, at the location corresponding to the end of the song. If i want to move to a part of the song, I need to move the progress chart backwards. Please fix this bug in a core UI. I am running Android 8.1, and already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app."
"It's a great way for you to find really crazy music, and while the ads have gotten worse (the good ol fashioned skip tricks have been patched sadly) it's still pretty solid overall. Key complaints are that you can't access messages on the app. Desktop likes playing breaks if you try to play a song that is 50-60 tracks down. Also stop screwing with the algo for the ""more of what you like"" playlists. It's fine how it is - stop changing it every 3 months, super frustrating."
"I used to have a great time with it until my samsung phone updated and samsung changed how bluetooth earphones work with my phone, and now I try to listen like I have for a long time, and I get blasted with sound, even at the lowest volume. It's not the fault of the app, which worked pretty well most of the time, but now I can't use it with earphones without getting my ears blasted."
"Overall it's a fine music streaming app that has a few kinks that really needa be hammered out. On the latest update it consistently crashes when adding multiple songs to a playlist. Experiencing this at this moment as I'm making a new Playlist for my latest favorite songs. So far it has crashed 3 times after adding around 8 to 10 tracks each time Another major issue that has been around for a while is when organizing songs in the queue, the wrong song will be moved and placed in a random spot."
"Very good overall, but lacking some quality of life features, especially for soundcloud GO users. Being able to play music stored on your phone, allowing other users to edit your playlists with permission, and at least allowing us to see the titles of deleted audios would all make the app even better to use/navigate. GO is basically just for removing ads at the moment. It doesn't really improve much over the free experience."
"It's really good, and has tracks I can't even have, especially since I'm stuck with Pandora. But I open the app today, and most of the tracks I try to play in a playlist don't work! So I try searching what I'm looking for and the search is also broken! I uninstalled and reinstalled and then it broke more- I'm very sad because it has all my favorite songs/sounds. I guess I'll just wait for it to work? Very disappointed."
"It's a great app, i can listen to music in the order i want, my only nitpick is that ads are very frequent, which may sometimes destroy my flow, if only for a moment. Another thing, sometimes video ads are trying to play, even with my phone off, which leads to Music not playing at all until i open my phone and/or the app. (Now these problems CAN be solved via SoundCloud GO+ but as of right now, i don't have a source of income....)"
"I've been using SoundCloud for 2 years but there has been an issue that I've noticed. On my old phone, i used SoundCloud alot. And i could overlap hear it on different apps that didn't have music. But it seems to not let me hear the music on other apps. This is really, really triggering for me because I can't hear my music for a certain time . I got a new phone which is my current, and SoundCloud still does the same thing. Overall, SoundCloud is the best 😁👍"
"Good alternative to Spotify if you don't like the app deciding a song for you. Only con is that some songs are low quality, and a small percentage might have the same name as the song you want to listen too, but isn't the same song. Some artists might also be picky and put their music locked, for subs which can really be a bummer for the free experience. This app can also help you grow your audience if you're a artist,Other than that, it's in my personal top 3 for music listening, give it a try."
"Overall, this app is good to listen to music and songs, however I don't like how every song that I really like to have to get with sc premium and then I can never find an alternative so I can't listen to that specific song. Another thing is when ever I try to upload music it won't allow me because it keeps saying it needs to be in my storage and drive however it is not there and I can't upload it. Please try to fix what you can, Still a 🔥 app though and will keep using!"
"There's nothing bad about songcloud really. It's free backround music from all singers and producers, the widget is good, you can easily create your own playlist, and just awesome. The only things is that in order to play some songs, you have to have SoundCloud go+. Otherwise ads are short, and at the end of songs."
"I really really love this app, and it's good and easy to use. The fact you can select one song to play without needing some sort of premium subscription is amazing and unique. I would love it a lot more if you downed your ads. I understand the need for them but just a few months ago I would only get one every few hours instead of 3 every other song. It's really hard to want to keep using it when my music is being interupted by annoying ads"
"Constant clipping and sometimes loading issues when listening to music. Please fix it. Never used to be a problem. I would elaborate but there is a stupid character limit on here. I know its not my phone, my connection, or earbuds. Other people are having similar problems, and when on my pc, soundcloud works like a charm. I have over 1000 songs liked and favorited. Because of this, ive had to resort to using spotify when listening to music from my phone. I hate it, but it beats shredding my ears."
"Pretty hood. Only problem is the good songs are paid for. I have an issue that I've never had before: I want to listen to 4 songs I have in a Playlist, yet the other day I added another one directly to the ""next up"" but now I can't get it to go away. No matter what Playlist I click on or what I do it stays there. Please help [edit] I fixed it but I had to delete and re install the app to do so. Not very promising for a road trip with no wifi"
"Always been a fan of SoundCloud, great place to find new music, and of course post my own music when I used to make some. One complaint I have though is if I'm listening to a long mix for example, there's no easy way to fast forward like 10 seconds without dragging your finger and I usually end up going minutes forward instead."
"Okay, i love this app! It works perfectly when im on the bus and have no wifi so i can rock out to all my music offline! And you dont exactly need the premium unless your super picky and dont want ads and you want better versions of the song. I enjoy this app so much! But theres a teeny tiny problem. After abit of time it started to slow down and not play my liked songs, it would glitch out and play something i dont exactly have on my liked lists. But thats all thats wrong with it! -Jordyn :)"
"App is amazing but there is one or two things that bug me. 1, The ads. They don't annoy me that bad, but they are too frequent, I suggest less adds. 2, for me [idk if it happens for anyone else] but sometimes SoundCloud likes to randomly start playing a song or continue a song. For example, if im in a call with friends, and SoundCloud suddenly starts to play music out of nowhere and I don't know how to make it not do that."
"Like all music apps, SoundCloud is a really decent music streaming service and a good way to start off your music career. But like all music apps. The player widget doesn't completely stretch out to fit the screen. If this problem is fixed, I will give your app a whopping 5 stars out of 5."
"This has to be my favorite app for music. Only problem is when I try to like a song, it'll unlike it. It'll show up in my liked tracks then it will remove itself. not a premium song. I tried to like dead eyes by Powfu. & it won't let me. So I tried 5 different songs & still didn't add to my liked tracks. I have 256 songs. I feel like I can have more songs. I updated it. Still wont work & rebooted my phone. Still isnt working. If you can fix this problem itd be very much appreciated!! Thank you!"
"I absolutely love this app and I bought the membership a few years ago and have had lots of music in certain playlists. One bug is that i keep getting old songs that show ""Not Playable"" ""Not Streamable"" (even on wifi) and its completely stopping or rearranging my next up songs and its really annoying when the music just stops and I'm driving or in shower... please get rid of the not playable songs so I can listen to my music again. Thanks"
Everything about SoundCloud is good; the only reason I put 4 stars is because some of the better music or versions of songs have to be listened to with the premium pass which kinda ticks me but everything else on SoundCloud is good. I don't get much ads and the quality of the app is good. I just wish you could download the music without having to get premium. But thats how it works for almost all the music apps so I guess I cant really complain about that.
"Love SoundCloud, but..feedback. PLEASE add the function of keeping the playlist selection menu open when adding songs to a playlist. Sometimes (often) when I add a song to a playlist I want to add it to other playlists as well..and it's actually quite annoying to have to click through menu > add to playlist ..and then have to scroll down again to find 'said' playlist. It seems like something so simple..but it would make a world of difference to me as a subscriber."
I truly do enjoy this app..other the ads really. My 2 problems are that sometimes il get a ad after each song and the major one is video ads were i have to go to the app and watch it..wich wont let me watch it in the background..this kinda defeats a good purpose as i dont mind ads as long as i dont have to mess with them but i dislike having to pull my phone out and watch it to listen again. If there was a way to fix it i would give it 5 stars
"I really love the app. It's a very nice app as if yhu can't find songs on other apps soundcloud will have it. But the only problem I have is that it clears my listening history n I lost a lot of songs I use to listen to because of it. Plus sometimes yhu listen to other songs (reccomend songs for a example), it doesn't appear in your listening history. I haven't had this problem widd my iPhone 7+ but it does it with my android"
"Love soundcloud though lately the app has been continually freezing while music is playing. It'll keep playing but I can't pause, skip, it change tracks. When the track does end it remains frozen and will not play the next track. Usually can be easily fixed by just manually selecting another track, but it's ultra annoying to have to fix every few songs."
"this is the best app to stream songs on the daily, has few ads and a good interface, and soundcloud ends up getting a lot of leaked music which is a bonus. However, the app used to automatically save songs that you played a lot offline (without requiring a soundcloud go membership)and one of the recent updates has since gotten rid of arguably one of it's best features. that being said it's still my platform of choice"
"I've been using Soundcloud for about 4 years and i generally think it's a great music service. If you want remixes and find new music this is the where you want to be. I have 2 small issues, first since 2 updates ago the lay out format changed and I don't think it was an improvement because now say you look at an album of a band with a long name, there isn't enough room for the song title. Also you may check out a playlist, some suggested by Soundcloud, track Says Not available in your country!"
"Soundcloud is a good app, but I prefer Spotify. Soundcloud has a more complicated setup and isn't as straightforward, but it allows for personal creation better than Spotify. It also works without having the app open (Soundcloud). The downsides to Soundcloud: you can't find all of the music you want at once, there is no loop or remix button for your playlists, and the verified creators' music isn't as easy to find as their remixes are. Otherwise this app is really well made! 85% recommend! 💕"
"The reason I'm giving this app a 4 star instead of a five star, are two reasons. The app is amazing, but there are just two reasons that ruins the experience for me. First of all, there are literally so many ads. While listening to my playlist, only after two songs, boom. An ad. So much ads, it's annoying."
It's a great place to get your self started on getting your music out there even though at times it seems like some of our contents seem to get blocked or reduced plays end up showing up and that makes no sense but other than that i love it !! I'm expanding to new platforms though so that it won't hold me up or hold us back !
This is a pretty good music app and it has ALMOST every song but some of the songs I want to listen to only have cover options but I can also find unreleased songs so that kinda makes up for it. I understand the ad situation because they gotta put adds and make money every once in awhile it starts glitching for me and my playlists won't play the right song after but I just close the app and usually it's fixed. The music sometimes start playing without opening the app.
"I've been here for nearly a decade. Spotify seems scary and monolothic to me. The interface and look of Soundcloud feels more natural to me, and provides for a more pleasing experience. Also, another part of having been here so long is that the algorithm really knows what I want to hear. Not entirely sure how it works for newer users though. Overall, 4/5, appealing and interesting, less impersonal than Spotify, and more like an audio version of ~2010 era Youtube."
"The application works very well, never had to many issues. Only problem I have with it making it 4 out of 5 stars is not being able to complete purchase transactions when trying to pay for Twitch Turbo. Also I feel like it's impossible to find the UI to try to purchase it without using a search engine. Otherwise it's a great way to watch gamers play."
"Had to revert to 14.6.0 because of the new media player that doesn't switch to 'Audio only' when minimized or screen turned off. Meaning, if you watch in 1080p and turn off the screen it's still downloading and playing 1080p file in the background, wasting the battery and bandwidth, whereas in previous versions it would switch to 'Audio only ' that uses way less resources. It also stopped sending me notifications today for some reason."
"I love the ability to stream, but there are a lot of glitches in Twitch's software... especially in the transitioning to ads. Even besides that, I constantly have to refresh my screen while watching streamers because I'll get black screen video and network errors. I found out recently that I am not alone, either."
"The app has been quite helpful throughout the years I have used it. I don't think I have had too many issues, I mean maybe sometimes it won't count how many viewers I have at certain times. Like maybe it will count 1 viewer, when I have like 2-4 viewers, and other times it counts all my viewers. Other then that and maybe a few minor bugs, but surprisingly still an awesome app!"
"Overall, the app has been great with improvements for using on your phone. But, the most recent update now effectively crashes the app (not in the traditional sense, it basically will no longer load streams up and will sit there acting as if it is trying to do it - you can't do anything in app aside from close it out completely, and that's delayed)."
"Great app, found some of the best content here. The newest update seems to interfere with my background play a bit though. Before I could place the box screen anywhere I wanted on the screen even when I wasn't directly on the app, but now I can't and it's really annoying. I also can't remove the box from the screen when I'm done watching, it only puts it out of view even when I move it to the ""remove"" option at the bottom of the screen."
"I just wanted to leave a review because I think the formatting on Samsung devices or any other device other than Apple, needs to be fixed. The formatting/markdown doesn't show up as intended on streamers about section. So it looks really cluttered and not pleasing to the eye as intended. Other than that, that's the only issue I've really had to deal with. This app is great and versatile! I always have a wonderful experience watching my favorite streamers go LIVE! 💕"
"Should work on the settings tab. There is not a setting to change your own email, username, password, ECT... Also a few other features would be nice but all in all I use it to manage my streams chat and it does a fantastic job. The look of it all is very nice and well put together as well. Not sure if it's me or not but not a single stream will let me watch it through without buffering every half a minute."
"Overall, this app is great and I could spend hours watching. But, almost every time I've tried to watch a stream- whether it be previous or live, my screen would freeze up. Sometimes it would load until it kicks me out of the app, but other times it would simply not show movement on the screen, but still play audio and update the chat. Thanks! Have a good day."
"Everything you want from twitch as a mobile app. However, there is a common playback issue for android, where the audio and video desync after an ad. Sometimes it's just simply the audio being sped up slightly. It can only be corrected by closing the app and restarting. I would love a fix or maybe some playback options, and then I would give a five star"
"I have been using this app for about a year and it has worked fine for most of that time. However, recently when watching live streams, a few seconds will repeat then a little bit later the stream will catch up those few seconds that were lost. It's a little annoying and can make the stream a little confusing to watch sometimes. I will continue using this app but just wondering if there is anyway to fix this issue."
"This app is fantastic! I've forged some incredible friendships that never would have been possible without this app. However, there is an issue with certain streams where the audio comes through but the video doesn't. All I get is a black screen, and i have no idea how to fix it. Other than that, great app. Please fix the black screen issue, though!"
"It runs well on college campus', but i want to see them optimize the app on android so that big picture mode works like how the youtube app can play in a smaller box that you can move around the screen while you do other things. I dont want to be forced to watch the stream in the app, sometimes i just want to listen as some streamers talk before starting whatever they are doing."
"The app is wonderful, I can watch my favorite streamers at any given time, stream my self, and so much more. BUT- whenever I am watching a stream, right in the beginning pre-middle, middle, post-middle, and end, there's ads. Even double, triple, and quadruple ads! Even more ads pop up to! I hope you try and fix this- I don't even know. Please just fix it. The ads are a problem for ALL of us, no matter how much we love it, the ads just have GOT to go. Other than that, enjoy your day/night!"
"Enjoying the app so far, but I do kind of wish it had the same amount of control as it does on desktop. There's a few advanced settings (like saving recent broadcasts to the home page) that were a bit of a pain to find, but overall not a deal breaker. The best thing about the twitch app is that I can see chats live and manage my stream while I'm on console."
"I use Twitch on my laptop, but it needs repairs as of now, so I decided to just up and get the app. It's not half bad; connection can get a little funky at times, and I think some things with the Landscape mode could be better (part of the chat kinda cuts it off. Maybe make so we can scroll to it from the bottom?) but other than that, it's pretty solid."
"Love this app, it's been a great way to keep up with local club DJ's and meet new ones from anywhere and everywhere. The bugs... Cast to Chromecast doesn't work correctly. It connects, gives channel with spinning circle but doesn't load. When you minimize, or turn off phone to listen to audio only via Bluetooth, etc, the music stops... It generally comes back a couple seconds later, occasionally it doesn't come back without going back into the app. Nonetheless, I use this app almost daily now"
App is pretty decent. Only bug I get consistently is playing audio from the stream after I've switched to another app or locked my phone. I really wish there was an option to download and watch vods offline. Sometimes I don't have access to the site and would like to still be able to watch my favorite streamers offline. It is equally a shame that the Twitch API no longer offers the ability to do this.
"this is a pretty good app. the only thing that I can find so far wrong with it is after an ad is finished during a past recorded stream, the stream slows down a tad and it makes the person's voice a lot deeper and the video a little slower. this is been going on for months now so I thought I would make a review on it."
"Its really good and simple to understand and use, but there's one big problem. Everytime I start watching a stream there's a 30 second ad, which is really annoying since you can't skip it either. If you could either ad a skip button or put shorter ads, like 5 second ads. If you could fix this, then I'll change my rating to 5 stars :)"
"The app is great but not perfect. It might be just me but I have a hard time editing stream names because any key (letter, number, even space and erase) make the text cursor go to the end. I was hoping it would go away but it's still there. The bigger problem is I wish it showed the overlay I have set up in the ""Overlay Expert"" in mobile. It would make my whole experience better."
"Great app. This last update brought in a really annoying bug where the vods, and live streams skip all the time. It skips forward and then back, and the forward and back and on and on the whole time. Its so annoying and frustrating. I find myself not wanting to use the app because of this problem and will probably be taking a break from this app till the problem is fixed."
"The app has a lot of the features of the desktop version. But I've noticed it lacks two things, the first is chapter selection. This is what bothers me most, because all I know is the first game in what are often several hour long stream VODs and sometimes I'm not willing to sift through it to find what I want. Another is that some emotes don't appear and all I see the the text, like catjam. On desktop you would need the BTTV extension, but that doesn't seem to work on mobile phones."
"It's a good app, I often watch friends streaming art. However recently the stream would work fine for, like, a couple minutes before it starts pausing to buffer before it just buffers continously. It works again for a few minutes when I close and restart the app before the stream starts buffering again. My wifi and phone service is fine and I'd rather not do the Uninstalle and Reinstall if it can be helped. Especially after seeing reviews where doing so just lead to more problems with the app."
"Love watching streams by my favorite youtubers. It's pretty easy to understand what is going on after a while. All the bits and subscriptions were a little confusing at first. However, my twitch app stopped working after a couple months. I would open it, it would start loading, and then it would close the app after about one second. I tried uninstalling and installing again, restarting my phone, I dont know how to fix it. Help or advise would be very appreciated as I no longer get notifications"
"Very easy and straightforward to use. Ads often play at times they're not supposed to- Ex. You click into a stream the first time and it plays an ad, a couple minutes later you exit and go back in again and another ad plays. I'm pretty sure there's supposed to be a cool down period for each channel. One thing I would love added is playback speed on vods. This is on the website and I often go to the website to watch over the app because of this. Support for BTTV and FFZ would be amazing as well."
"Playing with sound in background works fine for me! It minimizes into a small window that I can drag into different corners of my screen. I have to go to my home screen directly from the stream (not my ""following page"", etc) and I can't turn my phone screen off, but other than that it works good. Perfect for when I want to check other apps/read/write while I'm listening. My only issue is viewing chat while in full screen mode. Chat overlaps the stream itself instead of being side-by-side."
"The app is good. But I think you need to add more options in settings. For example I can't change your name on the mobile app, or change profile picture, which for people who don't have PC's is pretty annoying. And sometimes if a twitch streamers stream crashes you can't see anything but a black screen, which is a huge problem and that problem stays for all of their streams. Please fix that and add more options in settings, other than that it's good!"
"I greatly enjoy the platform and all that they do for creators. Additionally, the content is amazing, and I love the additional features being added to the video player. The thing that would lead me to say ""this is perfect"" is of you jad the ability to change speed, I would like to be able to go faster through boring parts of the streams (loading screens). Thank you so much!"
"Use this app daily. My biggest complaint on a mobile device is that it doesn't seem very optimized for mobile. Watching a stream with full bars on 5G speeds you get a lot of jank and jitter. When I stream something on the YouTube mobile app, it is crystal clear at the highest resolution available. Also, there is a bug with using this app on Chromecast with Google TV where if you have used other apps prior to opening Twitch, the app will time out and go to screen saver. Then you have to restart"
"The interface is a little wonky. Over all the app is very good. For instance , When a streak begins of subs or donations most of the screen is covered because the chat Box needs to grow to allow for the messages. This causes a 60% of the actual stream viewing percentage turn into a 40% actual stream viewing percentage. I end up watching the entire stream through a message or closing down the entire chat. I like chatting, I don't want to do that. But I really like the app."
"Great app for watching and supporting creators, but it is very hard to navigate. Took me 20 minutes to find the ""Not interested"" button in my recommended. Streamers commonly don't show up when you search them by name, even though they exist on the platform. Often can't watch past streams. Commercials are incredibly long. Takes up way too much memory for a streaming app (250 mb last I checked) when everything should be stored in the cloud. But it is one of the best of its kind currently."
"I love the mobile app for Twitch. My only concern is the bug that won't allow you to properly trim and post a clip via mobile. Also, is there a way for people to view components and extention panels from mobile? I have my Fortnite stats for my panel ext and component, but they are only visible from PC. If those two things can be changed, it'll be a perfect app."
"Decent app as a twitch client. I have an issue where streams keep playing audio after I close them, and sometimes even over other streams (I have background audio set to Never). But they also continuously bring more and more features like extensions and chests and the app performs mostly smoothly. Has come a long way from the original Android app."
"This is a great app to watch their content on. My only complaint is when I minimize the app while it is paused. Doing this always causes the video to start playing again. Frustrating when I need to pause and use another app while someone is taking too me. The workaround is to minimize the app then drag the notifications down and pause it there. When bluetooth disconnects while a video is paused, it also starts playing again. Haven't found a workaround for that yet."
"[Changed from 3 to 4 stars due to fixing an issue i down-rated for] The problem mobile was having with specific ads was quickly dealt with, though the advertisment system here, as a whole, needs some work, but otherwise, this app could be a lot worse. i only say this because i use Twitch Mobile every single day, in case thats any help with your decision to try out the app or not..."
I think the only way i would like the app more is if there was a way that you could keep the video playing (but a smaller screen) even when you go into another app. There have been a couple times i wanted to continue to watch the live stream but needed to look something up on google and when you leave the app it stops streaming.
The app is great. My husband has been streaming off and on for a few months and it's nice to watch while he does. I like the full screen and that you can hide the chat if need be. I will say that I think the viewer count is off sometime as it doesn't always count me as watching... It will say 0 when I'm clearly watching. Other than that the app is great. I haven't seen any glitches or crazy long delays.
"Does exactly what I needed to do as far as broadcasting my gameplay and making it quite simple to do so as long as you open up the app and then it opens up your game but for some reason then I have to exit and clear my game in the running apps and then reopen it otherwise I have the bar and navigation buttons stuck on my screen while I try to game. Also one last little problem, my gaming audio. I can hear audio from my gameplay in the lobby and all of that but the moment a match starts, no audio"
"I think this app has good potential and already has many functions that the desktop version has, but a problem that I do see now is that the app doesn't have the ability to skip to a point where the game changed when viewing VODs, in the desktop version, you can view all of the games in a list that the streamer played during that stream and you can click on one to skip right to when they switched to the game, but the app doesn't have that function so it's a lot harder to find good VODs to watch."
"Works great! It would be five stars, but the pop up player changed in a recent update to the one that you can't resize. It stays small, which is useless for most games with text, and while you can tap to enlarge it, that size only lasts for roughly 10 seconds. Would love to see that change reverted!"
"Streams are unwatchable on Auto quality. The video freezes for 1 second or so, about every 5 seconds. Audio is fine. Setting it to Source quality fixes the issue. When casting to my Chromecast, the top of row buttons stop working (share, clips, quality/settings). Edit: this issue appears to be fixed. Thanks!"
"I love the app, it doesn't have many problems, and is a great way to watch your favorite streamers while you're away from your PC! But, my only problem is that occasionally my notifications completely stop working, and it causes me to have to uninstall the app completely, then reinstall it for notifications to work."
"If im being honest I recommend twitch as a community, but not as a platform. The verification thing is super anoying. I open the security tab and try to very my email it resets saying its the wrong #. My phone doesnt close twitch either it just restarts the app. Thats just one of the issues, but overall its meh. The app has its bugs, which is why its 4 stars. The staff is a little bit <OK. But if your looking for a place to stream on twitch is where, would go into detail but there no more space."
"This is app is very good and I highly Reccomend it. However, if you want to START streaming here, the terms of service are very strict for no reason. My problem with this app though is that it keeps crashing. I was watching a stream, and I clicked off to eat. When I came back, it wouldn't let me watch any streams live because it would kick me out and crash. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it works most of the time, but still kicks me out rarely. Otherwise, it's a pretty good app."
"As of this update, the app is no longer playing sound from the watched stream when Twitch is minimized. I do a majority of my listening while my phone is off or with another app in the foreground, so the Twitch app is basically useless to me for now. Update! Background audio is back to its usual behavior, although it would be nice if it seamlessly kept the audio running when the app is minimized instead of stopping and then starting again."
"I love his app, even though it has its faults. Sometimes, while streaming, the app just ends the broadcast. When this happens, I have to completely close the app and reset up the stream, or else I will be streaming a still image and the audio will continue. I would like a way to add my own scenes/overlays to the app to use while streaming. So I could use the same overlay that I use wile streaming on pc. I am happy with the recent update, giving me a preview window while streaming."
"Awesome content! I would like it better if It had a setting to listen to audio without having to put the video up on full screen before turning my screen off since I can't watch while working/driving. Also, I have to manually restart the video every time it's interrupted by a text message or phone call"
"Usually pretty stable, and easy to use. I haven't experienced many problems with stream quality or crashes. However, background play does not work for me and it's really annoying to answer a text and then missing out on stuff that happens after it has to load back in."
"Overall, awesome, very good creators and the platform looks really nice and it's pretty easy to navigate. The only thing I could say is that if you miss even 5 seconds of a stream, you can't go back to it until the stream is over. You also can't watch vods or twitch clips while a streamer is streaming. Personally I dislike these features, but the app is likely designed for people who do not care so much about seeing things in order or missing things. Still, very great would recommend."
"I love twitch for so many reasons but I'm having so many issues with this new update. (I actually despise updates cuz they usually break what worked great IMO but got tired of seeing the update now screen) It keeps freezing, it won't exit off my screen when I close it out, it keeps crashing, the chat doesn't match the vod or the chat won't load for several minutes, or flipping the view gets locked up. I spend more time trying to fix it than I get to watch it. Sigh."
I enjoy the app and use it daily. I wish there wasn't so much of a delay between mobile and using a computer to watch streams. The latest update broke the pop-out window and now I am unable to move the window to wherever I want and instead it has to stay on the bottom of my screen. If they fix the pop-out window back to the way it was I would give it 5 stars.
"Pretty good app, ads are slightly annyoing however. However, it has two very annoying problems. A. Nearest-neighbour scaling makes 720p stretched to 1080p look like 800x600, very square and blocky. B. On a notched phone, the letterboxes aren't equal, and in the area next to the notch there's nice black spot(done to try to pretend it's not there). But it looks annoying, and makes the app looks amateur and low-quality."
"Great app of course, I watch streams all the time and I love all of the different aspects! The only downfalls in my opinion is that you can't change your username at all after you've made the account, and there tends to be often glitches that take a while to be fixed and can make it hard to watch streams, though I know it takes a while to fix things so thats not too bad. Overall, good app :)"
"From streams to streaming, you got it all. At a high quality. Runs smooth and is user friendly, however it does affect your gaming performance while streaming, even on a good device. May be a debugging ( don't quote me) issue, or something else in the code. But otherwise it runs really well."
"My overall experience with the app has been pretty good. I do wish that they would allow you to access some of the more advanced options in the setting menus. For example, I have to go to the twitch website to turn on the mature rating for my streams. I haven't found an option to do this in the app as of yet."
"I love Twitch and the content it represents and opens up BUT....this app has a lot of bugs and annoying issues that make it difficult to watch at times. Lag, buffering, repeating segments are just to name a few. It's amazing that gamers have a platform to showcase their skill and personality, I just wish this app did a better job of stabilizing the viewing experience."
"I like some of the features. Dark mode has helped since the app tends to hit my battery pretty hard. The alerts for followed streamers seems to work pretty well and the notifications section is nice. I really like the abilty to adjust stream quality in settings so I dont burn a hole in my monthly data when wifi isn't available. That being said, the app is still glitchy at times and has delay issues between the stream and chat. I also dont like how the features like subbing cost more on the app."
"This app is amazing barely any adds when you are watching live, that is a different story for when you watch something that isn't live. I was watching something live for around 3-4 hours and I only had like 2 add breaks with like 2 adds each, when I was watching a video after it was posted every like 10 minutes there was an add break with 3 adds per one. That was very annoying I would like it to be fixed, I know Twich needs to make money somehow, but really 3 adds per break??"
"I love Twitch, but I don't love this app. Everytime an ad plays while I'm watching a VOD--which is frequently-- the VOD's audio becomes lower pitched and even out of sync. I have to close the app to fix this which is annoying in itself, but sometimes it also causes my progress in the VOD to be lost. It's hard to enjoy what I'm watching with all these interruptions."
"Twitch, it's the most popular and we'll used streaming service for gaming for a good reason. One down side though is that multiple channels have become difficult to enjoy due to buffering issues even on high end PCs with fast data speeds. This issue has become especially common on mobile."
"Streams above 360p quality are extremely unstable on many Wi-Fi networks, often times pause buffering, lagging, or outright causing the application to crash. And many streamers don't bother with lower quality options, so there's no way to mitigate this issue. The stability and handling needs some SERIOUS improvements."
"Great app. Wish they would make the overall UI simpler. I would like to be able to search Subscribed Channels easier. I would also like to see them fix issues with delay. If I'm watching my friend stream, the stream would be delayed around 15-20 seconds."
"Been using this app for a long time now and have liked some of the new upgrades. Very useful when new to streaming also if you don't have a PC/Laptop. It still really needs some improvements in that area like: Cool sound alarts for new subs, host, and raids; maybe even for whispers and when someone @'s you in the chat. The ability to individually silence each one would also be needed."
"Overall, a pretty good app. But i have one issue... The option to filter different streams through language is gone! I want to watch streams in English, but without that filter, it is very annoying and time consuming to scroll through all laguages. Was it removed on purpose or is this a bug? Please let me know!"
"I'd give it 5 stars, because I really enjoy this app, and I love the accessibility, ads don't bother me either, but I can't ever stream for some reason. I think it needs to be able to run on low internet, as well, instead of only high internet."
"Audio skips when the screen turns on/off, which is annoying when I'm trying to listen audio only while walking the dog or whatever. Otherwise works well."
"Wonderful app for either watching others streams, or simply monitoring your own using their built in mobile dashboard. The dashboard really does help me out when I don't want to keep switching in and out of exclusive fullscreens! Stability has really improved over the years as well as user-friendlyness. I will certainly continue to use while I stream! The app would be perfect if you could also edit certain settings that only seem to be available on Desktop. Otherwise would have rated 5 stars!"
"I use it as a viewer monitor while I stream so I know what people are seeing and when. It helps me deal with the time offset between what I'm doing and when it's viewed. Also, it runs pretty stable... I think I only had one crash so far. That's a pretty good record in my book."
"Its a buggy mess but rn its one of the only options i got. The ui breaks constantly, sometimes you cant even see chat, theres alot of buffering, there used to be a bug where i couldnt edit clips ive made, sometimes i dont get notified of certain streamers but thats just twitch in general, sometimes streams get stuck paused when using picture in picture, the list goes on. Please twitch, fix your app."
"Great community, lots of memories, great way to find new gamers out just hang back and be comfortable. Dark mode is easy on the eyes and there is a lot of fun constantly. There are a lot of flashy new gimmicks to pressure engagement and it runs on an economy of donations and advertising, but still has a wholesome feel overall. 'Bits' are a penny. Raids don't work on my Samsung Smart Monitor which I'm using as my TV so I have to go on my phone or laptop to find who got raided switch manually. 😅"
"I think it's an amazing app and it has minimal lag. It crashs and closes when I use the sound alerts and then close the sound alert tab, I don't know if it's a bug or just my mobile."
"Its good overall, but there is one well known issue which affects the quality of stream - Major issue- the audio lags behind the video (stream) while using Bluetooth headphones/earbuds.The desync is much more noticable as compared to other platforms like YouTube.It ruins the viewing experience a lot. Twitch being a streaming platform,they should fix this asap. - sometimes the video stops and then plays almost 2x the speed for few seconds,while the audio is normal."
"I do like the app, however, there are some issues with it. It's no secret that the app doesn't feature nearly as many options as the website. If more features were added like changing the stream title and schedule and such, I would give the app a 5 star review."
"It's great to watch behind the scenes in Smps, or anything in general. It's fun listening to your favorite YouTubers the vibing or chating! Or playing random games!, one problem that I have is verifying xd, I can't chat without verification on my account sooo- i have retryed alot of times but it doesn't work so I'm just a lurker LOL-, besides that I love it❤👍"
"There are many glitches, some minor like the view count not loading properly, and others that are HUMONGOUS, like not being able to open the app for some reason, how does that even happen? Also points not working properly so redeems break, and there are many more. Enough to fill a Wikipedia artical."
That app is cool; I wish there was a screen sharing option as well as I have noticed some streaming delays (frequent) while watching; I have had to exit the app and return to reconnect to continue watching live stream viewing of who I am following
"A few minor small bugs here and there, most notable when viewing on mobile, if you leave the app and have it playing in a pop-up window, then go back to the app, you have to restart the app to have access to any resolution higher that 360p. Other than annoying ads sometimes it's great and I've enjoyed many, many hours of content and interaction on Twitch!"
This is a good app but there is one problem that I have with Twitch. I have noticed that there is a lot of inappropriate streams that keep popping up in my recommendations. It would be good if they could Restrict these from being on there and popping up so much.
The app itself is amazing but I can't edit my about panel on my channel if twitch would make it easier to edit panels this app would be perfect (there is no button for me to press to edit my panels)
"I really like the experience and the interfaces, however, after 30 mins of streaming it would go offline. Other than that, this app is amazing"
Easy to install and create an account. A bit confusing how it operates. Not a lot of content age appropriate to select from for older participation but still awesome to use
Finally native audio player has been integrated for twitch background playback. But it can still be improved with a button to close the player.
"Great platform but the amount of different streams makes it cluttered, navigation is alright not as intuitive as ibwould like."
"Its a good app for watching lives and sometimes going live but the thing is some kids under 12 can't go live and just gets kick if they do, I would like if you could put you live age to 10+ that's really the only thing."
"It's my favorite streaming app. I can use it on mobile and computer! While it doesn't have features that laptops do, it's still amazing!"
This is an amazing app hilarious people personally I don't watch bigger streamers because it is fun to talk to streamers and I would rate it 5 but there are a lot of weird things you will find on twitch but overall it is a great experience and I highly recommend it
"It works most of the time and when bugs and glitches appear, it's usually fixed pretty quick."
"I can watch my favourite streamers!, the only down side is that the streams are quiet and the adds are very loud so I have to keep turning my volume up and down repeatedly, but other than that it's great!"
"The twitch mobile app is great. I wish the PS5 Twitch interface would interact with it like the PS4 did though - the stream title, hashtags etc do NOT marry up any more. Please fix - or tell someone at Sony to, whoever's responsible, as current gen streaming from console is a far worse experience than prev gen. Ta!"
"It's easier to earn drop/rewards for the games that offer them. Too much ads, but it's whatever I dont pay attention until the reward notification appears. One star down because I wish there was a way to get a notification by the app or email when a certain game is offering a reward, because there has been times I missed rewards on some games I play because they either offer it for a day or a few hours. Instead I have to keep checking the reward menu to see if any new ones appear. It's annoying."
"I like this app and the creators that I can watch, but recently I have been having problems with audio not working when watching old streams. The ads I can hear fine, but some videos will be muted, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and tried closing and reopening the stream, also playing it from different times. It is important to me that I can finish the streams that I couldnt watch along for the whole stream."
Twitch streams are great and being able to watch in audio-only or with my stream locked is one of the apps best features which I wish the website had. It seems like there's probably always going to be a lot of bugs with the mobile app though. It feels like each update removes a handful of bugs but adds more new ones. Still definitely worth watching though
"I would like to see the app get a pop-up screen as other apps and even browsers have. So I can do other stuff on my phone while seeing what's going on, rather than just the sound. And when I let a VOD play in the background, it rewinds back to the starting point when I return into the app"
"Very good UI, the problems are mostly stuff u can expect from something this intensive on hardware. Minor glithes and crashes. Sometimes it's a big one but eh, not that big of a issue."
It is far from what browser site offers. All emotes from 7tv are reallly needed. Without those user can never have better experience from the app.
It's great and easy to use and the way if you exit the app it goes to a small screen in bottom right so you can continue to watch.
So its an amazing app the thing is that I want to stream about Roblox and I need to put my phone number and it starts with 0 but you can't start a phone number with 0 so it doesn't work overall this is a good app
"I enjoy it I watch it as much as possible. But there is one problem. Translation, I like reading the chat every now and then. I watch multiple Russian streamers and I can't understand what they are saying (apart from the little Russian I know)"
"One of the unfortunate things I've found, is the time it takes for drops to arrive from specific games. But meh, there's always a bug to be discovered and fixed, right?"
"I love using Lightroom mobile and for PC. It is easy to use and has everything you need to edit (lighting, effects, defringing, crop). Although for a month or so now, when deleting photos, the photo won't fully delete. The thumbnail will black out, but when the app is restarted, the photo is still there. The only way to fix it is to close the app and reopen. Also, my cloud storage has slowed significantly and is constantly spinning."
"Image processing produces superb photos for being a phone app. The issues I've had -Saving edits can be slightly confusing at times. Some tools (Mask) won't apply after edits are saved/exported. Touch input for value sliders can have delay/inaccuracies. I've not determined if these are user error or app malfunction yet. Export/Saving finished work to external storage needs to be optional, not strictly device storage. Overall image quality is excellent and navigating is simple."
"This app has always been a perfect option for mobile editing but all the sudden after the last update im finding bugs that are so annoying and time consuming. Such as the leveling tool is now broken or has been changed for the worse, and the gallery filter is glitched out (will not display edited only photos and shows some edited photos as not edited). For a large company like Adobe to make errors like this in small ""bug fix"" updates is unacceptable. Please fix and double check your updates."
Everything is great except for one thing that really annoys me when i edit my raw photos. Adobe needs to tell their developers to change the sensitivity of adjustment sliders because they are overly sensitive. If there is a way to tweak it somehow so I am not struggling to get the right number of the slider I want it to. Hopefully this review reaches the developers of thr Lightroom mobile version. Hopefully it improves in the near future! THANKS!
"Has acceptable post-processing effects, but don't expect desktop top-level quality here. I used this app f for school and personal use, but otherwise a more detailed and dedicated computer app is necessary. I recommend installing the default version of Photoshop on a computer or some other mobile app if you want more features. There are no flaws with exporting as far as I'm aware of, and the filters do not malfunction in any way. I'm very impressed with having these tools in a mobile app. g g."
"It's a pretty good app! I don't have any of the issues stated in the other reviews (not once). My only complaint is that, after a short while, all my previously uploaded and edited photos delete (or seem to) and say ""failed to load development version"". Also viewing original photo takes a while to load. Other than that, smooth sailing!"
"It's fantastic. Im completely new to photography and with the editing capabilities of this app, I've convinced people I'm a professional. But there is a downside. Recently i went on the app and found that none of my previous photos were appearing. I added a photo and it worked fine, but all the older ones never loaded. It says failed to load development preview. I tried restarting my phone but that didn't work Some help would be appreciated."
"I love this app, have been editing with it for a while now however i think the staff should be made aware that there are bugs on it. When editing a photo, red boxes appear on the photo and it is super annoying cause u have to keep pressing the back button and going back to the photo which takes like 10 tries. Im going to email support about this but be aware."
"I like it a lot.. I use it to edit my raw images on the go, it's not the desktop version but it does alright enough for me to use it... ...It can be a little annoying when it comes to adding ""new photos"" I'm sure there's a way to select multiple images, though I haven't figured it out... ...I wish there were more desirable presets, they do have a bunch but most aren't worth it... ..The auto feature pretty much only brightens pictures that were ment to be dark or make images more saturated."
"Works surprisingly well for a mobile app, just need to have a snapdragon 845 or 855 CPU...I tried on my pixel with an 821 and it took forever to apply the chsnges. I really like the tutorial idea, but it doesn't let you zoom, expirement, let you flip back and forth to examine the effects. It's nice to have for a beginner, but could be far better if they gave you a bit more freedom."
"I'm having troubles when I load a photo, and pull it up to edit it, its clear and crisp, but then the app renders it for a moment, no matter what I do, and it turns hazy. both raw and non-raw photos. annoying as all get out because I basically can't do anything with it because it never goes back to being as crisp as it was from its initial moment when i bring it up."
"Recently added gone!!! Taking away this feature has caused a headache. As a photographer, I contestantly go back to photos I've taken years ago. Or upload photos taken awhile back. I then have to spend time searching for the photo! Also, currently having to uninstall and reinstall as it's been crashing over and over for a day now. Please send bug update it whatever it is 🤗😊"
"It's fairly easy to use and has plenty of great choices for editing. If you have an adobe account, you can do so much. Not sure what not having an account gets you. Probably nothing special. It works great for editing all your photos and making things look great. Not an ungodly amount of ads and battery used is normal for an editing app. Really would recommend this for designers!"
"Good app but still lacks a few things from the desktop version that I hope get added. It really needs size adjustments for the brush tool and eraser. Automask would be very helpful as well. On the linear gradient, it would be helpful to see the mask so you know where to erase. Again, a size adjustment on the eraser here too. And a way to automatically maximize the whites and blacks like the desktop version. Keyboard shortcuts would be nice too."
"I like Lightroom a lot. Literally every photo that I edit goes through Lightroom. The controls are smooth, masking is great and the end results are polished. Continuity in look is superb. A couple things are preventing me from giving it 5 stars: 1. Not being able to export in PNG format. 2. The default import setting compresses images, and I lost a good deal of product before I figured out the problem. 3. Being able to add text to pictures would be another step saver. Make 1 and 3 happen=5"
"Amazing features for adjusting effects on photos! It works well and is one of the best photo editors I've used. The amount of features for the free price is also impressive. However, one con that makes it not an all-in-one app to use. I can't do things such as add titles and stickers to photos. I have to use a different app for this. I know there's Adobe Photoshop Express for that, but I prefer this app. It would also be easy to implement seeing that Adobe knows how to add those features."
"Fantastic, except there's no support for color tags, and it no longer shows the current count of photos sorted. I use the color tags a lot to sort photos, and really like being able to see how many photos are currently sorted (if i choose 4 stars, show me how many there are, etc). It used to do this, I don't know why it went away. Works great otherwise."
"I pay a lot to Adobe for this app and 2TB of cloud space, I love it when it works but the Android app is more buggy than Widows, Mac, or iOS versions. Currently it crashes or takes me back to the main screen everytime I tap ""All Photos"" then the "">"" button to view my most recent group of photos. Very frustrating! Update: after coming back to the app in the afternoon the bug above that was very frustrating had disappeared. I couldn’t tell you why but all is good now."
"This app is overall great, and very well put together. It shares most of the features that the desktop version has. However, one complaint I have, is that when I go to import photos from my phones library that I've uploaded from my dslr, not all of the photos make it into my library. Most of them do, but when I look for a certain astro-photography picture I liked, it wasn't imported to my library. I looked back at my phones generic gallery and the pictures were still there."
"I love this app. It's really great! But my only problem is the best way to crop photos precisely is on a computer or laptop. It's frustrating when I'm on the go and all I have is my phone. When cropping on the phone, it crops by shrinking the edges of the images instead of cropping a little bit of the up/down left/right sides."
"Please, for the love of all that is holy, make the select subject and select sky stop crashing the app (and sometimes my phone). It's the coolest feature I've ever seen but it seems to take too much processing power to operate at the speed it's set to meet, and causes the app to crash and sometimes the entire phone. I have an A71 5G so it isn't a WEAK phone."
"Such an awesome photo editor for photographers on the go. Only issue I recently ran into these past few months is that the app would go black on me (not crash) able to leave and come back in background app selector but still shows black unless I close the app completely and reopen thus it happening again after a few minutes. Not sure as to why, I run with a LG Q7+ If that would be of any help. But again great app!"
"Looks like latest update fixed my problem. App looks good and I am looking forward to use it in full. ===≠=========== On LG G7 ThinQ (Project FI) app closed during import of large number of photos. After that, app closes everytime I reopen and the only fix is to clear all data. I thought it's caused by specific photo, yet importing in small chunks I can move forward. Eventually it still breaks, though."
"This photo editor is amazing. I can make my photos into ones that are vivid and amazing; ones that are high-definition. However, it takes up way too much space. Could you guys please make it so that it didn't take up like 600 mb? A lot of the time thst I try to use ghis app, it tells me that I can't import a photo bc there is not enough storage, despite the fact that the app is why there isn't enough storage!!! It's stupid!"
"Lightroom was a good app as far as its features and what it provides, but learning how to use this app, I personally thought was really difficult. There was no tutorial on how to use the apps functions. I was very confused and one very frustrating thing was that none of the pictures were showing up in my gallery and there was no clear way to get them downloaded into my phone. It took me over 10 minutes just to find out I had to hit share to download the pictures. Was a good app but confusing."
Great product except one issue. The app is great and does what I need with my photos. Recently however for some odd reason only the most recent photos added have a preview before clicking on a photo. This makes it a painstaking process to find a photo. please fix this issue.
Editing is pretty simple. I paid for the year but im starting to think I wasted my money. I finished editing the photos and now trying to re-download them on a USB but it continues to keep crashing. And on top of that I have to download any photos on my computer first them drag them to the USB.This is so frustrating.
"I recently started using the Lightroom Photo & Video Editor app, and I have to say it's been a great tool for enhancing my photos and videos. The app provides a wide range of editing features and tools that allow you to adjust everything from lighting and color to sharpness and clarity. One of the things I appreciate about this app is how user-friendly it is. Despite the wide range of editing options available, the app provides a straightforward interface that makes it easy to navigate and use"
A pretty good app but I'd like to see three additional preferences. 1. The ability to set a specific folder for the imported or captured images. Not just SDcard or Main Memory. 2. When importing images already on the phone it would be preferable to Add these rather than Copy them to avoid having the same image in two different locations. This is an option on the Desktop version. 3. Option to export to a specific folder.
"Super amazing, but had a problem. For some reason the photos in my phone that were accessible all disappeared and couldn't access or view any pictures in the app. Found in a forum the solution: After clearing cache and data and deleting app, restarted the phone and the app is working."
"This is the perfect photo app, especially for colour grading or colour correcting. I would like to rate this 4 starts even thoughts it's perfect, the one star remaining is for you guys(software developers) to kindly please add us scopes. Especially the Vector scope and the parade."
"I love using this app, it gives me the best editing, but one problem i have with the app is that, it keeps crashing, after editing a picture, trying to save it will take up to 3 minutes which eventually leads the app into crashing. Please try to fix that"
"4.5 Takes very good quality picture even with my bad phone camera. always something new and useful to find, and great help in editing. only con is there are a lott of stuff that need the pro version therefore having to pay for it, but the pay would be worth it."
"Lightroom itself is wonderful! Very user friendly and the membership is TOTALLY worth it. But, the app crashes a lot on my chromebook."
"The app was good but suddenly when I open it i shows that my photos was all black out and it says that ""failed to load the development version""I hope the developer can fix this, I really love using LR to edit my photos."
"a bit expensive of you're not using it for work, still the free version is a great tool, very capable and reliable for hobbyist photo editing"
"It syncs with lightroom classic, it's buggy from time to time but it saves you a lot of time."
Great. Glad to see the improvements. Edit: after latest update the previous settings button disappeared. Could you please fix. Thank you
"Sometimes, when i'm editing my photos, there is something like framerates drop pop-in and out in tools editing, it's not smooth movement like usual."
I like it very much this app is very beautiful editing is best for photos this editing app can edit very easily .... Thank you very much to the creator of light room' app ❤️❤️❤️
"There's some unnecessary features and things that just aren't clean about this app but it handles raw photos excellently, and it has a good selection of presets by both Adobe and fellow consumers."
"Does not export the xmp files as the desktop version does. I use Droppbox to sync my pictures, but this app is forcing me to rely on Lightroom cloud"
"Well I would give it a 5 star but since this new update, it just keeps on crushing and that is very disappointing as I need it for my work.... What is going on? So frustrating."
"Could deliver a better workflow w the non-premium app features, but definitely better than the stock Gallery app or Camera app for online sharing over mobile data, etc ****/5"
"No doubt this is the ultimate photo editing app out there, but of late I found one bug which bugs me a lot. Whenever I try to share a photo or photos to Lightroom, it doesn't accept the same for the first time but we need to do it twice. It accepts in the second chance. Please fix this."
"Everything Lightroom does it does well , especially sharpening photographs of people , I just wish it was a little less complex , maybe eliminate some things that aren't used a lot . Other than that , it's nearly perfect ! Thanks Adobe !"
"App was very useful for me until very recent But, suddenly all the edits I have done vanished from the phone gallery Even in the app, count and black boxes showing up But, can't see the edited images When I click an image, it showing me an error saying FAILED TO LOAD DEVELOPMENT VERSION What it might have been? Please, give a solution"
Using Lightroom to optimise the aspect ratio of photos for Instagram. Works very well. The user interface is clean. My only gripe is not having a way to group export albums into my native phone album so I can upload to IG. Or better yet if IG allowed you to access your Lightroom albums.
"Still a great app, but I've downgraded my vote because it has started crashing so constantly that I choose not to use it. Nothing worse than spending time on an edit to have it crash and none of that work was saved."
I live the app it's really good and it takes good quality pics but sometimes if u take lots at once w/o letting hhem load they don't show up so just be mindful of that😭😂
"a lasso would be cool, but other than that, I love that I can now edit my photos via my phone!"
"great overall, super helpful features and easy to pick up and use, a paywall is present, however it only really limits video editing, although the fact it is free to do basic but still good photo editing (even on a phone) makes it a steal"
I love this app & I would have given it 5 stars but it keeps crashing before I even finish my work & my work ends up not being saved at all & I'm required to start afresh which is frustrating. Otherwise it's a good app.
Good but a problem. So I upload my photos from my camera and my photos are in my gallery. So I go to lightroom to edit them and their not popping up so I deleted to photo and did it again but nothing popped up. I also deleted the app and then tried again but nothing shows up
the features that provide by this application is really nice and also good experience to edit pictures .
Keeps crashing often but overall it's a great app. Sometimes the albums can get corrupted and you lose some recent photos you may have uploaded but overall the mobile app is great.
it great to use and brilliant it jsut lacks the ability to transfer you photos easily and quickly
i love this application but is there an ability to export in PNG after editing raw files that doesn't compress resolution? ^_^
"I will give this app 4star it's pretty cool to use, exposed to crazy features, like wow🔥 but I don't have access to other features because of the paid version. I suggest they reduce the price of the subscription. the app is cool anyways"
i sincerely enjoying Lightroom with its more options. i can't wait to switch to premium.
It is a useful app but i think there we don't need a premium to do it if u are seeing this please remove premium
"I this Lightroom is great, however I wish I could use my school's login information like I can on desktop. It used to go through Google, but now we use Microsoft accounts (aka, through Outlook). I receive the entire suite on my computer, but it appears to not be an option on mobile"
No words about this app. It is a perfect app for editing.
Wish I could easily remove backgrounds. Need to master masking.
"overall, app works very well. it makes many things less time consuming. that being said, mostly everything that can be done here, can be done elsewhere for free. only thing is it takes more time. is $8 a month feasible? it depends how much you plan on using it. If you use if often, the time saved is worth it. If you're hardly using it, stick to free software, that's a little more time consuming. for $8 I'd like to see way more features though."
Lightroom is one of the best photo editing apps for phones out there. It's great in making photos look as if they were taken by a professional. I would have given it five stars but the app started crashing. The screen will turn black whenever I edit. I just opened the app and I've been waiting for minutes but nothing is appearing. I swear this app is good but this problem is quite dissapointing. Please fix this and I will be happy to give five stars.
"I love Lightroom! It works well with my Huawei devices. However, right now I'm using an OPPO Find X, and full screen mode isn't supported. There isn't even an option to switch to full screen mode. While I use the app, about 1/5th of the screen is just black and the app only operates on 4/5ths of it. It's quite disorienting. Pls fix this quick! Thank you!"
"Great app, really love it, but there are some things that could be improved. I have my Nikon DSLR connected to the Snapbridge app, and it pulls all my photos onto my phone. If I want to edit a pic in Lightroom when I go to ""add photo"" the photos shown are in date order, but not time. So they do not show in the exact same order as the Snapbridge app. You also can't see the filename, so when you have many photos of the same subject, it can be quite hard to pick the one you want edit."
I'll definitely say in terms of editors I have used this is one that I love. The only issue I have with the Android version of this is the lack of the ability to add image files via the system file directory. This is a major problem when trying to to use a Chromebook or Android tablet as a photo editing device. It will be nice for the mobile version to have plugins. I would love to have the ability to export original + settings since I can plug a usb c SSD into my phone if needed.
"This is a really good app. It edits photos amazingly well, and has a lot of options, and NO ADS. Sure, there are some features which can only be used via a subscription, but I think that's okay. My only complaint would be that the UI is a bit complicated to understand and navigate. I think it can be simplified and made a bit cleaner and minimal. Also, it doesn't save photos to gallery, maybe there is a hidden option that I haven't enabled, but it should do that by default. Overall amazing app!"
"It's nearly there, but it needs work... 1. There's no option to import lens profiles; 2. Chromatic aberration correction isn't great. Needs a colour picker to select for both green and purple fringing; 3. Android app crashes, click on wait instead of close app and it comes back to life, happens when moving presets; 4. Need to select multiple presets to move them to a new folder, instead of one at a time; 5. Export as PNG is needed. Keep going. It has the makings of something great."
"Great to be able to edit on your phone, but I wish they would make desktop presets more compatible. It's a nightmare trying to sync them to mobile at the moment. I also wish you were able to change the background color to white instead of black when editing for Instagram etc, as the dark theme plays tricks on your eyes and makes you edit darker than you should."
"Works surprisingly well for a mobile photo editing solution. I still feel like I get better results from my laptop for making more fine tuned edits, but if you're just cropping and adjusting colours it's fantastic. My only complaint is when I import photos they're all out of order and there doesn't seem to be a way to sort by filename. I copy raws from my camera to my phones internal storage and it shows them out of order every time. Once imported you can sort."
"One of the best apps for editing photos. I would have rated 5 if the adjustment sync worked fine on Android. When I press and hold, it's supposed to show me the original. On Android, for synced photos (changed elsewhere), if I press and hold, it doesn't show original photo. Just the changed, edited one. This issue doesn't exist on iOS or Mac OS."
I have been using this as my app of choice for colour correction and tone editing for a small while now. The only thing i find lacking intuition is the healing tool can be a bit hit or miss . The effects tab is pretty useful. The masking tools such as the depth tool is good for landscapes. I think really though this would be better on a tablet with a stylus. More screen real estate would improve the legibility of images and ease their editing.
"I quite enjoy the app, it suits the very basic kinds of edits I generally want to do. Though there's been a longstanding issue where the only fix seems to be to restart my phone. I'm finally annoyed enough to write about it: if ever in the edit window and you need to swipe up or down for Android system functions that never goes away. Instead it leaves me unable to access the program functions on the scrollbar across the bottom. It's super annoying. Is this just a Google Pixel thing?"
"I have watched the app develop over the years and I really like the new selective edits. My only issue is that the ""select subject"" option is not quite 'intelligent' enough to fully select the complete area you're hoping for - it's currently hit and miss as to whether it does. For example if you have a shot with trees and you want to select all of them, the selective editor might only recognise one or none. I suspect it works brilliantly for portraits but can it be improved for landscapes?"
one of the best application that i ever use.It never lose your image poxel and resolution and provide us a detail edit.
"PLEASE FIX there is no profile for lens correction for the Samsung S10 series (which came out already a year ago). Hence also no auto-lenscorrection possible, must be done by hand with a different phone's profile. For the editing part: I am very happy, easy to use and very powerful app, especially when editing RAW files. Only the before/after viewing mode has some bugs that it does not properly."
"Very basic options available, but if you want to change geometry you have to pay 5 Euro per month. All little to much for an feature like this. If it would be once a year i would consider it. Edit 10-2019: On the other hand the feature appears to be integrated in Photoshop.. so you have to pay for the function in Lightroom but is is for free in Photoshop. Two different worlds apparently? But nice to know, and the functionality in Photoshop preforms well beyond expectations."
This is really excellent app but the problem is some main features are premium. When people likely to using this app then developer should give the all features free so people can edit there photo nicely.
it's a very good app to make ur photo look good and add lightings to ur photo
Love it! I love that I can add my 123 presets to this free app and create professionally edited looking photos.
"adding photos to the library to begin editing is much more cumbersome than it needs to be, but the results are usually excellent"
Great software. always improving. meeting or exceeding competition.
Unable to use watermark in paid subscription too. Pleas correct the bug. Its a very very important tool.
Some features like selective filters and masking can be offered for free as it has been a long time since it is in the Market
"I've been using this for years, gives you so many options so overall a good tool. But with the latest update, lost all my presets I had made. Also in the newest version the photo thumbnails are not available so I have to check every image one by one if I want to retouch a pic again. Hope this will be fixed."
One of the best app for editing gonna have to say this. Thank You Lightroom
This is one of the best photo editor I have ever seen... It has many more great features to edit your photo...I LOVE IT....
Recommended presets is no longer functioning in my Android phone for a long time now.
"Generally I like this app and do use it quite often. However, there are some things that are really annoying. 1. Slow syncing or no syncing at times with cloud content. 2. Pictures won't always import from device. Otherwise, I have very little to fault with the app."
Works for simple edits. More edits require subscriptions or whatever
very good app for photo editing but without primium masking tool doesn't work
the app is very nice to use I love it you guys are trying for the good work I paid someone to teach me how to edit quality photos and he shown me this app it a nice app
This app gives wide varieties of editing tools. so loving it!!.
Very good. Would have given 5 start if they didn't want money to edit RAW
it's nice for photos editing but pay money for videos but nice
Great and effective but needs the border sizing export option
Definitely I have never seen any editing app better than Lightroom..
"Honestly it's not perfect. But its what you ask for, and often more. The ads don't feel too often or too sketchy, the playback isn't glitchy or laggy. There's a far greater selection than I could have anticipated, but the cheap looking Tubi originals sometimes intrude a tad too much. It's not as bad as Netflix or Prime about that, though. Yes, its got a lot less polish, but functions just fine."
"I enjoy many of the movies, but I find navigating through the app to make my choices on what to watch aggravating because there are no clear directions. I've learned by trial and error. The same is true when I wish to return to a movie or series I'm in the process of watching. Another thing I find frustrating is the way the picture gets darker as it proceeds, making it difficult to see details. If I have trouble hearing some of the dialogue clearly, the subtitles are also blurry."
"Almost perfect. So many underated and wonderful shows and movies, especcally for animation and classic movie fans. Big issue i have though is picture in pitcure mode. It works fine until u reach an add, where you need to go back into full screenand sit through a couple of ads (about 3 ads, all together making u watch about 4-5 minutes of ads). To calrify, i am totally fine with the ads, i just wished it wouldnt force me into full screen when the ads start to play"
"This is an overall excellent app. There are a lot of movies you cannot find elsewhere as well as older movies that, I guess, the other services consider too old. It is fun to watch tv programs from other countries. This can be a real education as to how other countries view America and Americans. Russian tv series, for example, are in Russian, but using subtitles works great for me, and you too, unless you are to lazy to read them. Overall, I recommend this app."
"It's a real nice app, I had quite a few really good movies to watch, the ads are annoying but quite short, it tells you how long the ad will take and typically it's 2 or just 3 short ads at a time, it's a lot like cable tv, except if the movie, show, or special your watching, it's in it's original rating,as in tv-ma, R, or tv-14,it's a pretty cool and convenient app, I give it 4 stars ."
Love the app I really love how commercials have a more designated time that is thought out instead of random times in movies. One thing they need to fix is when I have the app running and I posit if I were to touch my microphone to speak to text the sound from the movie I'm watching turned on. Very very very annoying. Even if I clear all my apps I have to physically turn on tubi just to turn it off.
"Pretty good free app for streaming tv/ movies. I've seen many good movies that I missed over the yrs. It also has good tv shows you may want to view again. The ads are in the right place, you can resume from right before the break. It's better than other stream free apps. I pay for a couple, but find myself watching Tubi more and more."
"I absolutely love this app. Has an amazing range of movies in all different genres and has both new movies and older classics. However the app is very glitchy. Sometimes movies will start over but when I try to skip ahead to where I left off, it freezes and the play button won't work. Very irritating to say the least."
"There are so many streaming Apps and services I wasn't even going to bother with reviewing any. Tubi is pretty cool, they need to keep working on the UI. The controls seem a bit clunky. The live TV part of the app is pretty cool, they have better News programs and channels than some of the others."
"I love this app! There are movies on here that I hadn't watched in years or that I just choose to rewatch. The only issue that I have is let say you want to put a movie in your watchlist or read what the movie is about. When you click on the movie it automatically starts and then goes into your watch history even if you didn't watch the movie. That's so annoying. Before it was never like that, you could click on the movie and it would start once you pressed play. I hope Tubi goes back to that."
Relatively few and short commercials. Thoughtfully placed. Great player w/ good picture quality. Movies start instantly. No waiting when scanning ahead or back. Wide variety of content. Recommendations pretty accurate or close enough. Update 3/11/23: Downgraded 1 star due to the addition of intrusive notifications during programs. They have to be dismissed while watching programming because they cover part of what is going on. Ads fine. This has gone beyond. Not cool.
"Great selection, I watch a lot on here. But man, get your app working. I'm really getting angry with closing the app out, then the video randomly starts playing audio in the background. I close a video out, then 15 minutes later I go to read a text message and suddenly it's playing the next video's audio in the background. It's really obnoxious. Other than that, great app."
"Lots of content and the ads aren't intrusive or overdone like on some apps that still want you to pay. The reason I knocked off a star is when an episode ends and it supposedly goes to another ad, instead of an ad, it freezes. I don't know if it's a chromecast compatibility issue or the app itself. I have to disconnect from Chromecast and close the app then start over to watch the next episode."
"I wanted to watch a tv series. It's been five minutes and the video is still loading. I've experienced this with the app on both my phone and tablet and on the website. I tried six different streaming apps I have (Netflix, Hulu, Boomerang, Prime Video, Pluto TV and Disney+), all started playing within seconds. So the problem is obviously the app which is a shame since I actually like Tubi. Figured out the problem: my VPN. So I added the app to a whitelist and the video started playing."
"Pretty good movie app to watch movies legally for free. The adverts are fairly short and come at reasonable intervals during movies. (I can't even stand to watch movies on broadcast TV any more, because the ads are so long. These ads are MUCH LESS time wasted.) The selection changes month to month as they acquire licenses or licenses expire, but I notice if something goes away, it might return later. A lot of decent older movies. Not very recent ones, but that's ok for me."
"...a generous four stars for content, but a much lower rating, if I could, on overall functionality of the app. I've had it, then deleted it, all because the app is so lacking as far as keeping a connection and moving on to the next episode in a series. I'd love to see some improvements. I feel confident that it has nothing to do with my equipment here as I do not have these issues any other time I am streaming. Again, great selection of content considering there is no charge..."
"This app does what it claims. Good selection of movies. It's not hard to find something of interest. Some movies seem to have more ads placed than others, but the ads are bearably short (15 to 20 seconds) and you're back in the show before its flow is substantially broken. They have to raise revenues somehow. Good, clear, continuous streams. No account to establish... no password to fumble with... just download the app and go. Overall, a winner."
"This app is awesome! When watching TV series the ads are two or three back to back, very short maybe max of 30secs. Then they don't play again until the next episode. If you don't use the app and watch through browser it is one or two ads. I haven't watched a movie yet so I can't say what the ads are like on them, but so far they are bearable. Netflix and Hulu pass them in the variety of things to choose from, but Tubi doesn't skimp on the selections either, they could just have more."
"I really love it. The ads during the movie are a bit distracting (I'm so used to no commercials,I don't like them) but hey,it's free and they aren't that many. Can't beat that! Plus It has a great selection of movies(a lot of old faves),better than Netflix which is turning into nothing but shows! I don't however like that you can't rewind or foward,so if you miss something or want to skip a part you can't. I just got it,if there is a way,I'd like to know"
"I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account."
"Awesome app! 1: Because one can watch lots of HD movies for free. 2: Because even though there are occasional ads, there are not so many that they interrupt a scene or are so frequent, that it becomes too irritating to finish the movie. 3.The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars, is that there are not many classics; older movies that are gems, cult classics, all-time-greats, etc. It may be that they think the target market must be young and uninterested. Please offer more classics."
Its a great app. Still new to using it though. Not difficult to navigate through the selections. The movies have to buffer way too much while watching. I could watch about 30 to 60 seconds and then it would start buffering which is very annoyong especially when the movie is getting really interesting. I start to loose focus on it when this happens because of how long it takes to buffer just to watch only a few seconds before buffering again.
"Awesome app overall with just a few flaws. It's free so yes it has ads but there aren't very many and they aren't very long. It has a pretty decent selection of TV and movies and is pretty easy to navigate. It does have uneven volume lvls from commercials and even throughout whatever youre viewing. The ""Play From Beginning"" selection is a little confusing. If it's a show you're watching it starts it from the very beginning of the series (first episode) and not the start of the episode you're on."
"Let's get this out of the way. This is no netflix. It's a free app. Naturally, the quality is going to suffer, but surprisingly, it doesnt suffer all that much. Tge audio quality is good and the video quality is satisfactory. My biggest petppeves so far is the lack of customization. You're only options are whether you want captions or not, and depending on your phone, the screen format will not fit, and you cant adjust. However, having owned both Tubi TV and Netflix, I would recommend both."
"I enjoy the free movies, but they are limited. The ads are anywhere from 15 seconds to 1 minute and each ad break can be anywhere from 1 ad to 6 ads. I'm not complaining that much, considering cable, and the fact that these movies are free. All in all, it's a pretty good app and I have reccommended it to aome of my friends. If you need any advice though, I'd say that having more recent movies might make the app more popular. Especially favorites."
"Great app, enjoying the options. You have a very good selection, especially the documentaries and faith sections. The ads are fewer than TV, and Tubi rotates viewing, bringing in new movies and series. I recommend it, if you're on a limited budget. I have had a problem with connection, Tubi and Hotspot aren't playing well together. Maybe an update is needed."
"Overall, a good selection of movies I like in the thriller and disaster genre. Would like to see more selections in the nostalgic TV categories, like the Waltons, Little House on the Prairie, and Happy Days. Rarely crashes. I don't mind commercials. They give the chance for a break and geez, this IS free. The picture/Audio quality on my Android is excellent. I appreciate always having something to watch!"
"The best Free movie App ever! An amazing selection and I love that they leave them up for a long amount of time, so you can watch them as much as you like, while still adding new movies to the list!! You can create your own list by adding the movies you want to watch so it makes it easier to get to them!! The main important and only complaint I have is the ""Ad's"". I understand that Ad's keep the App free, however they are extremely excessive and quite disturbing while trying to watch a movie!"
"i watch Tubi more than Netflix account. This is such a cool network. i only have 2 proplems with it. 1) sometimes the commercials are so loud they're almost deafening, especially if i'm watching on my cell phone and using earphones. 2) WhenI try to watch a movie, sometimes it will buffer every 10 or 15 seconds. When I stop the app and restart it, it doesn't fix the issue. Why is this happening? it doesn't do it with TV shows."
"It's first worth mentioning this is not a replacement for Netflix. It doesn't have the hottest TV or movies. That being said, for a free service, the selection is great, and the ads are not too intrusive. The only problem is the app freaks out when I hit the home button to leave temporarily. It sometimes boots me out and forgets my place on the movie I'm watching. Other than that, it's a great free movie app."
"A Great Alternative to Netflix! There a lot of titles to choose from, both new and old. And watching a couple of commercials is but a small price to pay for this free service! A few issues i have with this app however, is one, the titles you add to Watch Later is no where to be found, and two, if you exit the app the current movie often restarts from the beginning."
"Great app. Unlike most others I've tried before it has a good variety of movies,tv shows and interesting documentaries, not just a bunch of old boring grainy ones no one ever watched when they were out. It seldom freezes, easy to surf thru and you don't have to practically be a hacker to log in and out of it everything is very smooth. Other apps should stand at attention and take notes."
"What else can I say about a free movie app that has good movies and TV shows! I do wish there were more African American TV shows from the late 70s through the 00s. But again this not a deal breaker. 5* would be the rating I give but the commercial breaks are not in the most opportune places and sometime 2 or 3 run back to back. Again I understand that they are needed to allow the free content, but I have to watch commercials on channels I pay for also on satellite TV. An excellent app!Recommend"
I love this app. Only problem I have is sometimes after the ads (which are very short by the way!) the captions are off. I've noticed this only happens on my TV and not my phone. I'm hard of hearing and trying to learn how to read lips and so this is very frustrating to me. I have to shut the app down completely and restart. But besides that this app is awesome. It has a lot of variety!
"It's a decent set of movies. Not the latest and greatest but it was easy to get to. The controls are good, the commercials are certainly not worse than Network TV, a bigger variety commercials would be okay. But yes it has the entertainment when I needed and the cost is free. I especially like the decent selection of older movies that had. Good stuff from the 60s to the 80s plus 90s to the present."
"For a free app, it's awesome. Don't expect too many current (recently released) movies. There are not a whole lot of 'AAA' titles, I would call most 'B' grade (aka not so popular). Have not had any latency/buffer issues yet. Not too many ads, they come up every 20-40 minutes or so. The only annoying part is there is a lot of repeat ads. You may see the same ad for two movies. They only last about 15-30 seconds. Still less ads than YouTube. Recommended for all ages. Thumbs Up!"
In the spirit of keeping it simple.... I liked it. Good variety. It's free. Not so keeping it simple.... Impressive. I was curious to see what genres were available and I got far more than I bargained for. I scrolled through most of them and was surprised to see the variety. No bugs or glitches to speak of yet baring I've only used the app for 2 days. Only 4 stars because of breakthrough commercials otherwise 5 !
"This is a fantastic app overall. It's free and the commercials are minimal. My couple gripes, however, are that even when you're logged into your account, tubi mostly refuses to remember your saved shows/movies, and won't consistently continue a series where you last left off. That being said, it is free after all. So the few issues are definitely not deal-breakers."
Been using this app for almost a year. Yes there are commercials that interrupt the movie but they always play back 30 seconds after the commercial so I don't know what the person below is talking about missing a sentence. They must have a small attention span LOL this is one of the few apps that allows you to stream the movies to your TV via Chromecast. The only negative thing I would say about this app is I wish they would update the movies little more often. Keep it up Tubi great job!!!
"The selection is slightly above average which is understandable for a free service. My biggest complaint is the timing of commercials is really poor. It will literally break into commercials mid sentence of a major plot point. Studios figured this out 60 years ago...it's a big issue. Other than that, the ads are not too long or too frequent which is good; again... timing is EVERYTHING. Please fix this."
"This is based on my first experience. Watched an entire move, like an hour & ½. Only two ad interruptions. I'd say that's pretty good. Had it for a couple months now. Still gets 4 stars from me. Yes, it has ads, but they're few & far between. The only thing stopping it from that 5th star is that sometimes the volume level of the commercials is really high. I have to keep remote close by & hit the mute button before the ad starts, just in case."
"Honestly the app is great, I haven't really had any problems but if the app could give a warning as to when an add appears, that'd be cool. It could be a little box at the bottom corner of the screen that appears 10 seconds before the ad and counts down. This ensures that the ads don't take people by surprise. Overall, great app!!!👍👍👍"
"Great application, lots of options that can't be found elsewhere. Completely free, no credit card needed, but that means there are ads which I'm totally fine with. Only complaint I have is how quickly the library changes. I had a few movies saved in the queue to watch later and within a week they're no longer offered. So if there's something on here you want to watch, do it quickly!"
The first few movies I watched were uninterrupted. Then the commercials started. The commercials were not bad but their timing was weird. not where you expected them to be. The app does work well and I have had no buffering even with mediocre internet speeds at times. I guess my best recommendation us that I will continue to use it.
"I really like this app, it's great. Honestly, never glitches, if it does pause out searching, all you have to do is exit the show and start it back and itll play fine. I gave 4 instead of 5 starts only because when you pause your movie and come back, hit play, I usually have got to fast forward some the where I left off. It backs you up about 5 minutes. But that's the only real flaw, besides not being able to servh every movie you want to see. Overall, it's a great app though."
"So far I have enjoyed Tubi and the more I use it the better I am liking it! The ads have had some bad timing so far(usually at a great spot in the movie, LOL) but I can get used to an ad or two when the app is free to use! I have been using Netflix for the past few years and the price has gone up and its getting really boring lately! Out of all the movie apps I have tried the last couple of years, so far Tubi is the best one in my opinion right now!"
"The interface isn't too confusing, and being able to switch categories is also a breeze. Considering how other apps are with quality of video streaming, it's very good; no stuttering or sudden drops in quality. Since the app is free, there are ads but thankfully they don't drop in at awkward places in the shows and movies. They have some very unique offerings and more mainstream fare too. Definitely worth a download."
"It's a great app. Definitely one of the best for content and variety. I would give it five stars, but I seem to have buffering issues when trying to watch documentaries. It will pause about every 10-15 seconds throughout the entire show and I end up not being able to watch them because it's maddening. It's odd that only movies and series stream perfectly at all times for me. It's a bummer because the documentaries they have look great. The captioning is also off on several things I've seen."
"This app has been working pretty well, so far. No major issues, except that I cannot seem to get the screen cast feature to work at all. I think maybe my Blu-ray player is just too finiky. It doesn't work with screen casting, except from my boyfriend's Samsung phone. It won't work with this app from my phone, no matter what screen casting apps I've tried. This Tubi app does get some excellent & interesting movies, TV shows, and news programs though, even some of our old favorites, free w/ads!"
"At first i thought all the movies and shows were on the home page. Until i looked in the browse section and found thousands of more. Love the app but it looks to have quite a bit of ""porn""(sex films) on it and that's the only thing I dont like about it. I would change the pause feature because I have a laptop and I'd like to press the space bar when I want to pause any show or movie. Other than that great job with this app I recommend getting this if you're broke people."
"Obviously for free, it has intermittent ads and don't expect all the greatest movies, but it has a lot of good and interesting ones, as well as many less-so. The only issue I have ever encountered is that it doesn't really seem to load ahead - meaning if my connection drops for a few seconds, my movie stops. I don't know why this app wouldn't have this common feature. But overall, categories, your own queue, search, related, it has everything you'd expect and it is well put together."
"Can't beat a free movie service that has this amount of decent films to watch, the app is well made too. I like that it let's you cast to other devices and you don't even have to have an account! Ads are really the only thing I dislike, for obvious reasons, but they also are glitchy and either play or pause then skip back to what you're watching."
"I love this app, so many good titles but there is one thing that I would like to recommend: how about putting all the ads before a movie because sometimes I'm watching a horror flick and then it hits me with 3 ads as soon as it's about to be a big event. Kinda kills the suspense. I just think all ads before the movies would be so much better so that rather than interrupting, you just have to watch the ads before it and you still get people to watch the ads."
"Love the availability of some movies and shows not readily available elsewhere, and free, too! Only watched one movie so far; it had a LOT less time of advertising than television. My only dissatisfaction is that it is not consistent in making it easy to resume watching a show later on. I would prefer it default to that, or at least make it extremely easy to get back to it."
"Mixed in with the junk are some really good movies and the price is definitely right. The only frustration is the timing if the ads. They break in to the middle of a scene or even a sentence. I don't mind ads, something has to pay for the service. But when they're intrusive and annoying that doesn't do the advertiser a whole lot of good and it definitely doesn't enhance my viewing pleasure."
"Would've rated it five stars as I love the app all together. However there is a small problem some movies start replaying parts of the movie you've already seen. It quickly get back to where you were in the movie, but it quickly becomes annoying when it does it throughout the entire movie. That being said it doesn't do it with all the movies and most play perfectly fine. As for the amount of ads I don't see any issue as the app is free and so are the movies so you're bound to get a few. All in all great app."
Service works well and we are having lots of fun with it. A few things we don't like... 1- movies are automatically streamed in higher resolution. Need to switch to data saver mode in the settings. 2-I wish you could choose which recommended videos to see. Some of the thumbnails are borderline pornography and I'd like to block them but I can't. It would be nice to only see recommendations. 3- Commercials are SUPER repetitive! I wish companies knew that makes me want their products less.
"The movies they have are older, but the price is free with very little ads in between. The User interface is lackluster and basic, but it's effective and easy-to-use. It's the best app for free movies. Each titles rotate every few months to bring in the next group of movies that lived out their rent / purchase viability. Recommend for anyone who likes movies and entertainment. Very decent sized collection 😃"
"A very good, well-designed app with a simple, coherent UI. Better free content than one has any right to expect. The only reason one can't give it 5 stars is really not the fault of the app: the most in-demand content is new and under license, and just not available for free. But this is a good and diverse selection of desirable movies, and if it were possible to give 4 1/2 stars, I would."
"This app has always worked wonderfully for me, until today. I usually go through genres to pick a certain one to look through, and I noticed the horror section is now separated into three parts. When I go to click on the regular horror section, it seems to open the page again, and then I cannot click on that option. It allows me to scroll through the ones that are shown, but not open the full thing. The other two parts (horror comedy & action horror) allow me to open them with no problems."
"Just downloaded but loving the selection so far. I gave 4 out of 5 because the ads could be better integrated and I saw the same ad three times in a row, but the fact that it's a free service and doesn't have you register is enough to make up for it. Also, the video quality is much better than I expected and I was able to find stuff that I wasn't able to on other streaming services. This app also has less ad breaks and shorter ad times than Hulu and I'm paying for Hulu."
"I have had these app for a few weeks and I'm loving it! There are some problems though. . . sometimes when I'm watching YouTube or playing games the app doesn't work when I try to watch something. I have had to reinstall the app again and again due to these problem and I am not pleased. I don't know if its because of my phone or the app itself but its really annoying. Other than that, I love the app and it has amazing shows. Ads are minimal and most of the time short. Good work!"
"As far as the movie selections that are available, I love it! Closed captioning, my list is easy to find...Great set up! But I have issues with it randomly picking a movie just as the credits start. The ""personalizing"" by asking you questions locks you out of doing anything unless you fill it out. Then you get movies I would NEVER care to watch. Whenever someone says ""Hey watch this!"", is a good way to lose friends. It's the quickest way to show someone that they don't know anything about you."
"Great! I can cast it and its free. Commercials are minimal. Edit: Dropped one star. They have been adding more commercials and if trying to replay a program you have to quickly tap the progress indicator back to the beginning or it skips to the next episode. Also, casting button needs to be pressed several times to work. Also, they keep asking me to rate which I have. Annoying."
"In the beginning of using the app, i was not sure of the movies i would enjoy but after using the search and other options to find movies, i have come to really like tubi. I enjoy the family movies and other tv shows. Only problem, the fitness routines are difficult to do with the commercials so I have had to come up with extra stuff in between ads. Other than that, a great source of entertainment!"
"When you are challenged to commit to a viewing experience for concern that your choice may disappoint, Tubi makes it easy to get satisfaction with an expansive selection. The layout is easy to navigate, the content is organized accurately, and the descriptions are well expressed. This is a good place to catch up on cinematic history, develope your viewing preferences, and indulge. The presentation is perfectly smooth, with no delay, and few commercials."
"Pleased with this app! This app has a lot of different programs not found on mainstream media. Some is kind of quirky, but I like it. Definitely a good addition to Plutotv and Sony Crackle. Only issue I've had is sometimes the advertisements will go into an never ending loop forcing me to restart app. That fixes the problem. However, there are times when I can watch an entire movie with no ads. Not sure what the issue is, but it really is just a minor inconvenience."
"A wonderful supplement to any sort of paid streaming service. My only complaint is that for some foreign/international programming, I'm unsure on whether or not its subtitled or dubbed over in English until the program starts. Aside from that, ads are modest, more often than not quieter than whatever you're watching, and are rarely intrusive. I recommend this to anyone who wants to try out streaming services, or who are just looking for things that Netflix doesn't have."
"Tubi has very good movies -- not just the ones you'd expect but many I'd never heard of. There are commercial breaks (ads) but they are not long and not every few minutes. The Tubi video player plays movies well, doesn't get hung up, no stuttering. But the color isn't vibrant color. Seems washed out. The app could be improved in navigation. Not easy to get back to listings. And I do not like the autoplay next movie especially since the app randomly chooses which movie to autoplay!"
"I so I absolutely love Tubi and have used it for years. I'm always finding new things to watch, and in my opinion is the best app for horror/thriller/sci-fi films. The only reason I gave thos four instead of five stars is that there is no way to disable auto play. I hate falling asleep and finding that the app has played three more movies. The data saver option is great, but being able to to turn off auto play would make this app pretty perfect."
"Tubi is great, especially for finding less mainstream stuff. It would be nice to be able to rate shows, though. And it would be so appreciated if we could clear the continue watching section from any device. It's inconvenient to have to switch to a device you don't normally use for viewing Tubi and activate/sign in just to clear that section. But, otherwise, no complaints."
It is a good app. It has great TV shows and movies but what it needs to be worked on is the buffering when you watch a movie or TV show it does it quite often. The buffering can last more than a minute before it goes back to the TV show or movie. Don't mind watching the Ads it's the buffering that's the problem. I would give it a 5 star rating it's cause of the buffering which reduced it's rating.
"Currently (and this is a new issue) when I try to open the app it just says ""looks like the system is unavailable please try again"" and no matter how many times I refresh or close out and try again it doesn't fix the problem. Also when the app was working the continue watching feature was pretty much non existent and every time you exit out of an episode it brings you all the way back to season 1 episode 1 and you have to scroll all the way to the episode you're currently on."
"This app is good for being free. There is mostly older movies, but there are some good movies and shows worth downloading the app for. The ads are not so bad, really. It's similar to hulu in that way. The ads are short, 2-3 ads at a time. The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because the ads do freeze up sometimes, not often, but sometimes. This app is still worth checking out though."
"It's very good. The only drawback is that sometimes it takes long to boot initially. Once the main screen appears, everything goes smooth. Another feature that everyone will like is that there are very few commercials and they are short. Also - good cc (close captioning). This is extremely important because many of the actors/actresses nowadays mumble or speak some street, low class ""cool"" jargon."
"Great free app with a really solid collection of good and ""bad"" Horror films which is pretty much all I watch. My only critique would be when you click on a title it just starts playing without giving you a chance to read up on it. This fills up your continue watching que with a lot of stuff you might not like to revisit. If they fix that then this app would be perfect."
"Great app, has a lot of good shows and movies. The only issue with it is it doesn't synchronize where you left off. Always find myself looking up the episodes I left off from and it sucks, especially if you watched it in one system and then want to keep watching from your phone, you have to look for the episode because it always says ""Start Episode 1 Season 1... But if you have a good memory, no problem..."
"Awesome selection of movies and documentaries. The ads aren't intrusive, probably on par with broadcast tv. However, it does have a bug. Occasionally, during an ad break, the show you're watching will change to something else - like it advances to the next video in a playlist, before the video which you are watching is finished. I'm not alone in experiencing this, other reviews have mentioned the same. I do generally use this app with Chromecast, not sure if that plays a role or not."
"This is a very good app. The selections are very good for a free app. I wish you offered more classic movies. But the only way I can get shows to continuously play, is by mirroring my cast. Regular casting won't let me continuously play. Like The Andy Griffith show for example, at the end of each episode I have to go back to the title to choose the next episode."
"This app has beem great, especially now during the Covid-19 home isolation. Not to mention it is totally free. No annoying ads breaks to disrupt program viewing every 5-10 mins, like with other free TV apps I have seen. Lots of variety. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because they don't have as many new shows as I would like. But it's free so I can't complain much considering it is still the best free app I have tried. Keep up the good work!"
"Fewer commercials than cable, and completely free. How can you beat that? I haven't had buffering problems like I have with a couple of others, and the quality is sharp on a 46"" set. It even remembers where I left off so I can jump from Fire TV to phone and not have to remember the episode I was watching. I took off 1 star for the lack of viewer ratings and very limited descriptions (often a single sentence), and no way to set Continue Watching to show 1st."
Tons of good movies. But scanning through is so many different ways it is confusing. What have I already watched? 4 months of watching and I have started so many terrible movies and those are the ones that show up as stareted which would be nice if I wanted to finish them! It would be nice if there was a blurb for each film so I could decide without seeing. But this is s free site and that is a plus. They also add more and other free sites only add pay for stuff.
"Tubi is my number one streaming app. The picture quality is the same as Netflix, which is not free. it seem as if the choices of movies are unlimited. I get to see new movies, old movies reminisce in the past, enjoy the present, anywhere anytime as long as I have Wi-Fi. I love the fact that there are always new movies added to reflect the current holiday. I have other free movie streaming apps but tubi is my favorite."
"I'm new to the app. It's a little difficult to navigate on entry. However once in the content is good with the exception of invasive ads. I expect that this is a revenue source, however when I'm watching say a movie for example I'm used to getting up several times during said movie for various reasons. When I return my page has disappeared and I have to scroll through several items to restore my place."
"I like that i can watch shows anytime, anywhere with or without internet connection. I use a lot of data doing so, so that is why i have an unlimited data plan. Tubi also provides a wide range of genres for movies. If it is not listed type in the movie or genre and tubi will provide it. The one downside is that with no internet it does a lot of buffering. Other than that, it is a great service."
"I've had ups and downs with this app that ultimately found me leaving a poor review and functionality deteriorated to an uninstall. For whatever reason, conscious or otherwise, I gave it another go. And it works great! Movies and shows, the huge majority of them, are actually something people would want to watch, as opposed to other more ""gimmicky"" apps that claim to offer cheesecake but deliver stale cake donuts. This would get 5 stars if not for the constant buffering."
"I have found this app to be brilliant! Sure you do get about 1 or 2 ads, but for the price of zero dollars for all those movies, it's a winner. I'll have to throw in a quick warning...you can not skip the ads like you can most places after the minimum time frame...you are forced to go through the entirety of the ad."
"I found this app on accident, but am pleasantly surprised by the number of movies and t.v. shows you have on here. Many of them have been or still are on Netflix and then there are many B movies, but not all are terrible. The ads pop up every 30 minutes or so, but last about a minute or two long. Considering this app is free, it is a small price to pay to get to watch some of my favorite movies over again."
"I just finished watching a movie on here and it was damn good! But here is the reason why I given this app 4 stars. In between the movie commerical ads kept popping up. Not that they lasted long but it the principle of it. Other than the sound, picture quality, and the variety of options from movies, documentaries, television shows, series, old and new entertainment is outstanding. I'll try it out for a couple of more months to see if I still feel the same. But as of now pretty decent."
While i don't like commercials they aren't that long and that's how you get FREE.... FREE movies. So no big deal. I have changed my review to a positive review because it seems the movies have been updated. The only time I have had to read subtitles is only a short period of of time in the movie. I need to do more watching of more movies to see if my opinion changes. So far so good.
"Watched documentaries, indie, action and martial arts many unknown to me by name. All excellent. Eventually some current releases may find there way here. Ads are not overwhelming in number or length. I've seen more and longer ads on YouTube. Selections categorized for easier selection although a movie can appear in multiple categories simultaneously. I like the leaving soon category as a reminder. There is a queue function i believe, but have been too busy watching movies to use. Impressive."
"Fun to watch. But not a lot of good movies. Just keep getting less and less quality movies. More of the childish hollywood pumped out drab. Tubi can't afford much of the good ones. Eh, I can usually find 1 good one but it takes more than half an hour filtering through the bad ones to find it. It takes a long time to buffer and some parts get stuck waiting for commercials. Not bad for free."
It's a good app with a lot of great movies. I've had it about 2 or 3 weeks now and I dont have time to watch a lot of tv but I only have a couple small issues with it (1) some movies I planned on watching that was on there are now gone. It does have a leaving soon section but must mean very soon. (2) I watched a trailer that previewed English but when I watched the actual movie it was in French. So far everything else is awesome. Very few commercials
This app is good for a wide variety of movies. But would be much better with less low budget produced movies that were rejected by most broadcasting networks. Would also be better if movies could be searched according to preference. Such as a better on demand search. But I love the fact there are so few commercials. I'm just hoping for better movies to have access to.
"I think the app is terrific and the overall experience is very good. It has a lot of the movies I've been looking for but couldn't find without having to pay. There are commercials but not as often or as long as you would expect, so I don't mind. updated version: I am now, constantly having trouble with it loading over and over. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled thrice...didn't help at all. None of the suggestions did."
"Massive selection! I happen to love older, more obscure B movies. There's a virtual treasure trove of these, along with plenty of newer movies. Before the last update, it was perfection. I despise how you can't look at a title's description without the show starting. I have to mute my phone, & it makes the page jump around while I'm reading the description. There should at least be an option to turn this feature off. Otherwise, best app in existence. Player is amazing & rarely ever buffers. 🏆🌟"
"I personally love this app for multiple reasons, the quality, how there's only 1-2 add breaks (depending on if its a movie or short episode being watched) and easy to use. I found it because I was looking for more anime to watch, and there are many options on this app. One problem I had though is at one point I had finished an episode of a series and suddenly got rewinded to the first episode for no reason, I didn't finish the season either. But other than that I would definitely recommend."
"First time experience with Tubi TV, so far so good. I'm actually quite pleased with the all around variety of Sci-Fi Movies. It's like having the Sci-Fi channel without having to pay for it, which is quite awesome. The breaks for adds/commercials really aren't that bad & don't interfer with my viewing of the movies at all. I"
"Love Tubi! Indispensable app and service for watching movies and television shows. It has all of the great TV shows that you can't find on other streaming services or cable. I use Tubi far more than Netflix. And it's free! Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the need for a bit more functionality in the app, such as: 1. Ability to browse episodes that have not yet been viewed. As it is now the user has to search or find the show elsehwre on the app in order to browse episodes. Can't do it from Continue Watching because pressing the video icon auto-plays the next episode. 2. Rewind, 10 or 20 seconds would be appreciated. Thanks Tubi!"
"love this app. great way to find weird/underrated/b-movie type stuff. they also have a surprisingly large back catalogue of mainstream TV shows, which I did not expect. the ads are hit or miss - sometimes you get a ton and sometimes you get only one, it really depends on the film. can't say it's ever gonna replace netflix but it's still really good!"
"Review edited: It would appear that the Oct 29 update has fixed most of the issues with latency regarding video and audio glitches. The app runs much better both on my phone and on the new Chromecast with Google TV. There are 2 things left, keeping it from a 5 star rating... 1. When first starting a stream for a movie or show, the stream quality starts low, and then ""glitches"" after about 5 or 10 seconds as it catches up to full HD. Once it catches up to the stream quality, it seems fine, so mostly an annoyance on this one. 2. When starting to watch a movie or show on my phone, and then pausing and resuming on my Chromecast, it doesn't appear to know the point in the stream where it was paused on the first device. It does know that it's been started as it provides the ""resume"" option on the second device, but it doesn't pick up where I left off. Other than those 2 things, the app is working fine, and the content on EPIX is great."
Thanks for finally fixing the issue that prevented me from logging in (subscribed through cable provider). I prefer the new app to the old one :)
I took advantage of the free trial and did get to use the service somewhat. There is a pretty good selection of material to watch. I think horror fans would really enjoy this. Everything ran very smooth. It also seems like there is a lot more being done to improve the service even more. I recommend trying this out and believe I will be subscribing myself in the near future.
The UI is ok but the fact that it doesn't hold your spot when you return to the app to resume your show is annoying. I've had to screenshot the time point where I left off so I can move the timer back to that position when I'm ready to watch again
"Good, the app works smoothly on my Chromecast TV and also in my phone no issues, but not much contents or new movies , really slow coming through, not much going on to look forward to, things there stays forever, it's okay app maybe having it off and on, definitely NOT permanently!"
good movies not worth paying for mostly because the same movies are free on various apps I was thinking about trying this app again. I recall seeing the same movies on other sites that were free to me or on a service I already had. Well I am a bit ashamed to admit it but I am outta control and have so many premium subscriptions there isn't a movie I can't watch. Do I need all no I say. I am going to cancel all my subscriptions which will start ending by end of the month and download Epix 😎
"The app needs improvements. It needs to have more recent movies too many older ones then present ones,but thank youfor the free trail its a lesson learned as they say back in the day. You can always go by the looks of the cover. Which i can say that is a good looking avertisment it has a caught to it. Thank You again t brandt"
"I was mistaken you can use your Dish subscription to lock on to MGM Plus . ,therefore I give it four stars."
Some good content app Google TV not so great clunky hard to find things that are not even old let alone the massive amount of content they do have you can't find in the app unless you search on the TV or big negative if you do not have a smart TV with the ability to install newer apps you cannot use epics now with Comcast and I believe other providers I've read Maybe you can cast it but I prefer it all to just work but they all prefer money so check that trade or use in prime on deal days
small bug fixes
This app has some great classic oldies and a few good newer movie options. It's great also to watch using phone smart view or tv/device sharing but only if you have an uninterrupted signal😅 then its useless.
i like to reedit my review and make a few suggestions that might help the app for on seperating movie from tv such as making options were you can veiw what is a tv series and what is a movie seperatly. and another a download progress of what you are downloading to help know when your movies will be avaliable to watch and another suggestion is that every time you exit from a veiwing the details of a movie that you dont get pushed back to the start of the page so it'll be easy to keep track.
I love the app I'm supposed to have this free because of the Domino's coupons and I guess that didn't happen so had a 7-Day free trial and I didn't get a reminder on that one either but it finally went through it was just the point that you know customer service improved
"Pretty good overall, but the site is a bit clunky for playback options, if you go away and come back. But I love the resume function. Otherwise it is good."
Very good app. I really enjoy it. I'm sure once it gets more time and viewers it will have a greater selection of movies to watch. For now I would reccomend the app to anyone. 8 to 80 blind cripple or crazy..
I love it but would love it even better if one could see the movies without depending on a cell phone. I would still want it to be $5.99 after the 7 day trial!
Well I reviewed this network one before. The app seemed like a run of the Mill Nickle and dime you to death you then give you nada to watch cheap flicks. then a I Read a review and saw it was being opened up for a week or so for free viewing. That is on DirecTV only as far as I know but who knows. The lineup of Movies was impressive but I didn't really look at TV shows. This app does seem solid we will see tonight and I will. give it a shot and go back in review mode th tomorrow.
"awesome app.. wish it had more current movies, and more sci-fi adventure type movies. Love that Star Trek in several of the permutations are available."
"I would give it 5 stars but, it doesn't turn full screen when I turn my phone sideways. Other than that, love the app!"
"Good App just need more choices of good content, examples: movies-documentaries-specials. I love the Godfather Of Harlem, and War Of The Worlds. More Content like that is what im looking for."
"i gave a 4 because i didnt find the exact movies i was searching for ""ATL"" and ""Roll Bounce"", but other than that it has very great quality and no ads finally for the first time on an streaming app"
Has a mixture of old and new releases which id why I gave this app four stars. Would have given five stars if there were more current releases available; however the pictures are very clear. I eoul recommend this spp to family and friends.
enjoying as of late the movies are fair but already have seen them. over all epixnow is an awesome app to catch up or rewatch movies you like. keep up the good work. ttfn
"Wow! It's great. Was in a disabling motorcycle wreck and EPIX NOW enables me to watch shows/movies, not able to in the past. Love it. Must watch"
"Movies seemed clear ,abit Limitèd on Limited but.over all clear picture sound good. 5stars! By victor holness;beats many other apples by far! Well.Done!!"
"For someone who doesn't have Facebook or anything, I appreciate being able to scroll through this app. Keeps me entertained when there's nothing else to do so."
"I stumbled on this app, but for the money its well worth the time. Cool up-to-date movies and more. I'm a spread the word!"
I love the movies and the app but it keeps saying I have an error and I have to exit my movie and then restart idk why it's doing this but other than that I absolutely love this app
Someone is hacking to the site
EPIX NOW is a good service to watch my favorite shows and movies. But I don't use it as much anymore.
It has great movies but paying 5.99 a month no thank you we need to save for bills and providing for our loved ones.😉
i loved it but can get on xfinity now. its only like 499 a month on it. i love berlin station and deep state. awesome shows.
Wish they had extended Belgravia storyline. I did this rate from a link after the series. Shouldn't it have tied back to it?
This is a pretty good app they have a good selection of movies and TV shows some which are older but all in all I recommend it
"Liked it Alot, Except Trying to Get Logged In To Be Able To Watch It Via The EPIX NOW APP Using The Instructions That Came Up On Our Fire TV and Instructed Us to Use a 6 Digit Code That It Popped Up and Prompted Us To Use Inside The App On Fire TV, But The 6 Digit Code Never Worked after Getting 3 Different Activation Codes We Still Never Could Get The 7 Day Epix Trial To See If We Might Enjoy It... We Have Wasted So Much Time Trying to Get The EPIX App Installed..!!! GGGRRR"
It is a great app but it still have some bugs that need working because it freezes up
I like it so far some good shows really like get shorty im excited for epixnow to be streamed on pc soon its also nice you can download whatever show or movie you want to watch without internet
"Only 4 stars from me, because I think there could be a better selection of movies. But everything else is awesome!"
"Although there isn't a huge variety, they do have some good shows and movie selections."
it's nice has lost of movie choices. . I was looking for the broad cast station non cable for my area.
"nice app but won't load on my series5, 32in samsung smart tv. Have to watch on tiny phone screen"
Epix now is great because it has movies and shows that other apps don't.
Easy to navigate. Great collection to choose from.
I have this on my big screen this is good app I like that program with Forest Whitaker name Harlem I can view this anywhere on my phone acclaim award winner series
Great movies and tv shows all around a great deal for a great price
Great selection of new releases and good quality picture.
has alot of good movies some older and some new releases it's not a bad price I quite enjoy it
Great experience not enough free time to pay for watching it.
Its has tons of great and some of the best older movies ever made they have so u can watch
Great variety of shows. App seems to work well
"Great, but it should be able to cast to TVs."
just got it but so far so good great selection of horror movies wanted this app to watch FROM and oh my didn't blow my mind
I have to pay extra because I have sling tv but I can still watch epix on my phone
"it's good app, needs a couple touch ups but very entertaining"
Let's get ready to rumble
Everything you need to look into the information that will be useful 👌
I enjoy watching Pennyworth. It's always a fun ride.
New but program looks good
played the movie all way through.
Movies are great but lots of freezing.
Just started using this app but so far it's simple and user-friendly.
seem like a good app but I had password issues so I deleted the app.
nice app. watch all the movie and objoy you new manner to watch TV
some great choices wish categories had more to it
"Half of the idiots saying ""YoU CaNT CaNCel IF you GOT iT ThROugH DomiNos!"" don't seem to realize that that's because YOU REDEEMED IT AS A CODE. You did not pay for it with your card, that's why there's no way for you to cancel it as a subscription. So people, don't be scared to use it if you get it through Domino's. You'll be fine."
I am a subscriber through philo and I can't do anything to log on through tv subscriber
Loads of great films. Never a dull moment! I definitely recommend this app!
I love the greatest movies of the past and present only on Epix.
Good...just a few times it stopped turn off
"I just watched my first movie on this app, and I really enjoyed it! I watched R.E.S.P.E.C.T about the life of Aritha Franklin. You should definitely watch it, if you are a fan, or enjoy her music! 🙂👍"
Nice movie app but doesn't save where I leave off in movie.
Great shows but would love shows like CSI (Vegas and Miami) Can you help me get these shows? Thank you. Karen Quale.
Great and exciting a lot of fun I enjoyed watching The Godfather of Harlem
good movies shows what other channels dont
"please stop have TV now with it,but was very good 2 have on my phone"
It's ok but I wish I could access EPIX NOW on my computer.
"Needs more up.to date movies, but otherwise pretty good."
"I just started working with this app, but it seems awesome 😎"
It's a good app were a good app too watch sonic
"Nice, very easy, I just wish I got the code to connect my 📺 😭"
This is a great app it has all kinds of movies
"I love Godfather of Harlem. I just wish there were more popular, up-to-date movies."
excellent footage of stored movies
good just not satisfied with my wifi provider
it's alright just to much buffering
The movies are sensational.
you must dig deep for the really good movies
"movies on demand.anywhere, everywhere you go."
Look like a good app but I never used it even though I subscribed
better with sports activity but it doesn't have
i don't know i just got it and its worth less it do t work
"great, no other way to say it, great!!!"

Cool shows I enjoy like Godfather of Harlem. Great history
Its okay. Needs more selection.
I've been unable to cast to my TV
good selection of the movies I like.
Works well Note 20 Ultra
Like the movie selection. Would like to see more 2017 thru 2019 movies on epix now
Yes I said he was a pretty good help I was not into it but maybe
"Everything about the App is awesome, better than the competition, except one thing: the Radio feature still sucks. I'm not sure why they can't improve this. It always just plays songs you just played from your playlists. It's pretty poor for music discovery. Every time you play a station, it plays the same songs in the same order. Apple Music so far has the best radio feature. For everything else though, you can't beat YouTube Music."
"It's still no substitute for Google Play Music (yes, I am still bitter) but it has slowly become a great music app thanks to reliable streaming performance and a deep library of tunes. Shuffle, autoplay and ""radio"" play (what's the difference?) could use some help, though. None offers much in the way of variety for long-term listening. And there's still quite a bit of bad info -- songs in the wrong genre, bad artist/song data, etc. that mar an otherwise great experience."
"Really a great service. 100% would recommend to everyone, and do. Not sure why, but podcasts actually sound better here than other services. Could be an illusion. The only reason for the missing star, there is no intuitive way to integrate into my Garmin watch when I run, so, I end up maintaining running playlists in Amazon Music. Kinda a big deal for me."
"App is good. Would be great if the app had better tools to manage, sort, and navigate your song library. Very cumbersome and clunky as it stands now, especially if your song library is large. Would be great if the app could recognize songs playing from other sources and give you the option to add the song to your library."
"The only thing that I have found better in the Spotify app than this one is that while you're looking at the lyrics for the song that is playing it not only follows along with the words that are being sung, but you can also tap anywhere in the lyrics and it'll jump to that place in the song. For some reason I found that to be pretty damn nifty, especially if you are someone (like me) who is really into the lyrics of the music you like! 😁"
"Youtube Music is central to my Everyday Life, it can't compare to Spotify in my Opinion. Recently The App kept crashing on me out of nowhere, when it started working again it wasn't playing the next song unless I unlocked my phone, it shows its playing the song but nothings coming out then it loads and goes all the way back to the beginning of the song. I had to delete and re-download to get it working again. I'd give 5⭐️ but it seems it needs more work."
"YouTube Music overall is a great music app. If you have a premium subscription of just YouTube then the music app comes with it for no additional charge. But, now that I've also begun using Spotify as well I've realized that there are a couple features that YT-Music is lacking. Spotify offers the lyrics for every song which I personally really like. And what made me like Spotify slightly more is that YTM takes almost 1GB of storage space while Spotify is 140MB. So, Spotify wins in my opinion."
"I enjoy the interface, selections available, and the streaming quality by and large. However, every once in a while the music will randomly pause and when I choose to listen to my liked songs on shuffle, it is not as random as I like. I tend to hear the same songs a lot when I know that there are songs that are buried in my playlist that I have not heard in months. Also, I wish there were a way to play all the recommended new releases consecutively without having to individually play each one."
"I LOVE YouTube Music!!! They have everything and anything a person can think of when it comes to music. I've tried saving a few dollars, letting my subscription run out...but didn't even make it a full 24 hours and I was back to my library and subscription. It streams well. I just wish YouTube music would allow infinite space for downloaded songs for offline times. They limit it for some reason. And going through the entire library to download each one, one by one by one....would take forever."
"Overall, a pretty good app. However, I feel that this app is priced a bit, too, high. $10.00 a month is kind of steep for a music app. Also, for that price, there should be a few more features available within this app hours. I'm not going to get into them right now. But as a rule of thumb, thoughtful and well designed features are what make or break an app. Features should always maximize convenience and create smoother user interaction while operating said platform."
"I think adding the option to create station based on multiple artists is great. Something I been wanting and why I still listen to Pandora as well, which I think still is good. It just needs two things. Make it easier to add artists. You can't search, you just get options.. If you go and play some you like, add to library and maybe start radio it might then show up as option to add to custom radio.. Also be able to rename station. That would make it even better. Thanks."
"Having access to smaller artists and lesser known bands is amazing, I've been using the app (with premium) for about 2 years. The only issues that I've ever had with the app are the fact that downloads often don't load in offline mode for some reason or another, as well as how many songs get banned between countries with how often I travel. Otherwise, it's a good music platform."
"""File not found..."" The app works fine for online music. The UI is easy and well organized. Prety good App made playlist to enjoy. The problem im having is the downloaded songs will become gryed out with an explanation point(!) Over the album cover and unplayable with the error message ""file not found..."". I will have to clear my downloads and start over. Kinda defeats the purpose of downloading songs if I need to keep re-downloading them."
"Overall it's great. I think when y'all did away with the shuffle icon, it's been more of a pain in the butt, especially when I'm driving. Instead of choosing a playlist and the shuffle icon being available, now it's, choose a playlist, push a menu button, scroll to the shuffle and by this time, I've ran off the road, again. It's just a pain in the a**not having the shuffle icon as available as it use to be."
"I would rate 5 stars, but the last couple of months, it has stopped playing intermittently and I, manually, have to press play in the app. Other than that, it's the best music app I've ever used and I've used them all. Edit: I've fixed my problem. My phone recognized it as an app that needed to constantly be put to sleep. In settings, I just put this app as ""never put to sleep,"" and it doesn't kick me off anymore."
"ouTube Music is a must-have for YouTube Premium users and music enthusiasts who discover music on YouTube. The app occasionally has issues with downloading songs for offline playback, omitting certain tracks without clear explanations. This limitation is frustrating. However, overall, the app functions well and provides an enjoyable music streaming experience."
"Overall a well-refined app with an excellent selection, including both the works of larger artists and independent YouTube creators. However, when in areas with limited connectivity, the UI will load slowly or not at all, making it impossible to access downloads. Also, though a smaller issue, the lyric pages for songs are pulled from several sources, and are inconsistent, low-effort, and sometimes incorrect. On the homepage, album names are sometimes cut off for no apparent reason."
"It's really good. There are some times in which certain songs appear only on playlists and aren't avaliable to listen to, and send to change a lot. Even then, I love it so much I literally have like, 102 GB of memory on just downloaded songs on there. I haven't even been using it for that long. 9/10 definitely recommended, obviously the song selection sometimes changed not to my liking, but I think it's leveled out now."
"I've not ever had any ""bad"" or ""negative"" experience(s) and/or issues with YouTube. Period. However, there a lot of ads! And the ads are extremely repetitive. And one more thing, I'm not a fan of having to pay for the non-stop playing feature (where you can lock your phone AND still listen to music). Other than those two things, I absolutely love YouTube & YouTube Music!"
I am updating my review of this app years later. At the time I rated it one star. I hated it. However I retried it and now it's my go-to music service. A lot of improvements and I actually prefer the sound of the music over Amazon music. Access to the music videos\ visualizers is very cool. I do think they could improve the UI a little bit as you toggle between downloads and library. I also think they need to implement like Amazon has a system of rating songs
"I have had very little issues well working with this app for music. Don't like how they remove songs from it, haven't had issues with it playing in the background while using other apps either. They should reformat the home page, to make it easier to identify and add better features. Had a few issues well on Bluetooth, but that is to be expected any time."
"You Tube music is my favorite music streaming service out of all the big guys. It doesn't include podcasts but I have very rarely searched for a song and been unable to find it. The premium plan is worth the $10 month fee. The selection of songs, plus the ability to download and listen off line (I have to keep signing up for the free trial because poverty but if I had an extra $10 to put towards one service I'd choose YouTube Music over Apple, Spotify, or Pandora."
"Everything's pretty great, the sound is good, you can listen to anything, even unreleased music, and the layout of where everything is, is great. There is only one major problem I have, and that is that sometimes when I try to unpause my music by tapping the button, it usually doesn't work and I have to click it and extra 2, 3, or even four times in rapid succession. I would like this fixed."
"Edit: They removed the top album charts for seemingly no reason making it a lot harder to explore new music. One star removed from review for trend of over simplification of services. There's a vast library of music on here including a lot you can't get on platforms like Spotify. I can add great remixes from YouTube to my library and playlists, collaborative playlists similar to Google Docs, and the app focuses on the music making the UI get out of my way! It keeps improving."
"This is slowly getting better. I still think the algorithm is too ""loose"" (I get artists/songs on radio stations that don't make any sense), but it's not worse than Spotify or any other service I've used. Really wish they would implement the Spotify feature that lets you switch devices and continue right where you were listening."
"App is great! I love the capabilities of the app. The only reasons I'm not giving 5 stars are because the music videos to songs play when you hear albums which is kind of annoying because it adds stuff that are on the music video to the album (which was previously not on the real album). Second, the adds are pretty random at times. One day you can get no adds and on the other you can get adds for any song you play. So please fix these issues"
"Youtube music is worth it,my favorite thing about it is I can get remixes or different versions of songs into Playlists that are only available on YouTube. My main problem with youtube music is that it does not feel as if it's learning my music taste. I can listen to two specific genres and a couple of artists, and still get music that does not suit my taste. The best example of this is in, make your own radio, it let's you select artists to listen to but rarely does it play their music."
"I like this app. Please move the ""ADDED TO YOUR LIKES"" pop-up or make it smaller and transparent. The bar stays up for almost 10 SECONDS, which is ridiculous. It prevents me from viewing my queue, lyrics and related songs and I love quick motions, if anything make the bar pop-up duration no more than 2 seconds. I do miss all the different features that got taken away when Play Music was retired, such as the ""already in playlist"" pop-up."
"It's not bad with the premium, I use the supermix playlist a lot. Some days it's on point, with a great mix of bands, songs and genres that I enjoy, other days it's playing the same 3 bands over and over. Audio quality has improved but still has some room for improvement. Overall not bad but still a work in progress."
"Still the best music app available, IMO. But flawless it is not. There's still too much music that I either can't find, or only exists because another user added it (& quality of those is typically poor). Either the artist is nowhere to be found at all, or it'll have the artist with their discography, but one (or 2) albums will inexplicably be missing. It's incredibly frustrating. YouTube, you have money hanging out of your wazoo! Be better."
So happy they added the customize feature now all is needed is an easier way to sort and play music from liked songs. I don't want to listen to Christmas music in July. My preference but that's what would happen if I listened to my likes. I know there are playlists but to be able to use the customize to have a liked playlist mixed in with new stuff would be great.
I love this app it has music in all the languages I want and its easy to use. The only thing I would suggest is adding an equalizer to it. Like a settings button maybe. However only 4 stars because the songs stop playing while I'm driving and I have to open the app on my phone in order to hit play. It doesn't work when I touch play on my cars display
"I've been using this app for 4 years+ and i really like it as it has more variety than Spotify. The only cons are when transitioning between having cell service and in dead zones app will often fail to change the playlist to your downloads if you have done so app may also crash. Also, if you are playing your downloads while connected to wifi or cell service, it seems to still want to use data. I'm not sure why."
"I'm able to find all the music I search for. I like the recommendations it makes for me. My only problem comes when trying to play it over Bluetooth in the car. It tends to stop and not resume when the gps interrupts. It is hard to get my music playing once again, often requiring me to restart the app. Not safe while driving."
"I hate that paying for this means I lose the option for YouTube to play outside of other apps. When it shuffles my music for offline plays, I rearrange it in a preferred order which is great. But then it will just remove songs without prompting and change the order randomly which I don't like at all. Outside of offline play which I need right now, I don't like the app paid for this reason. I'm overseas and with the new update I can no longer search for music online. No longer worth $10/mo."
I would like to have a way to organize the songs in one place to see the different playlists they are in and to see duplicates of different versions (remakes). I would like to clean up my playlists without losing any songs but at the same time not having the same song multiple times in one playlist.
"I've enjoyed YouTube music immensely. But, the one thing that I really wish that I could do in the app, is search for a specific song within my playlist. Because, sometimes I just want to start my playlist from a specific song. And I have a playlist that has close to 600 songs in it. It's very difficult trying to find a specific one when they are not in any specific order. I wish they would have them available to filter as alphabetical order even."
"Really good, has most songs that can be found on Spotify. I like how even without premium you can choose whatever song you want to listen to instead of having to listen to the whole album and with infinite skips. Only thing I don't like is you can't play music with your phone off without premium which with Spotify you can. (Also my recap is bugged, never got to see my winter recap.)"
"I chose You Tube music mostly because it was easy to figure out. I pay for the subscription, which is so worth it for the extra features. It's intuitive play streaming works very well but you have to be mindful of what you let slip in, it can go off on tangents."
"I have had an alright time with this app until today. My search would load, then I would click the play next button, and the song would not put the song there, but it would go to the song that was next in my list to play. I can't do anything on the app now. Even when I go to the home page, it is black, nd so is all the other pages as well. I can't get my music on, and nothing will show up at all. If you can fix this, please do so imediately!! Thank you."
"I like that it's intrinsically linked to the YouTube platform in general, because songs that would otherwise be unavailable on platforms like Spotify, are available through YouTube. Now granted, it won't have EVERY single song you want, but it's enough. Had the premium subscription for a while now, and have absolutely zero complaints, it's a great experience."
"I've used the free version of this app for a couple of years and like it, but I wish you could turn the screen off as it plays. I like that you can skip ads after 5 seconds of play. A new update made it a pain to find my uploaded music. I thought all of it got deleted!"
"not sure what the intention was with hiding the shuffle, but it needs to be fixed. Proposed solution would be Playlist-specific settings. I'm guessing they're highlighting the constant attention the app gives to your Mixed playlists and essentially 'shuffles' them for you, but for my personal playlists I need to be able to set permanent shuffle if its not going to be a one-touch option anymore. Fix that and its 5 stars"
"Was better before, but now it's crashing whenever it should play in the background. Not sure if it's incompatible with the newest Android update or what, but it's frustrating. Before the crashing it was the closest to Google Play Music as far as algorithm quality and Playlist lengths/saving capabilities."
"With new ui changes, shuffle play button for a playlist is behind the dropdown instead of on the playlist page. Improved a lot. It's still bad at multi language recommendations. I listen to music in multiple languages. Would really be useful if there are filtering options based on language in playlists and recommendations Also needs to support higher sound quality like other streaming services"
Pretty good if you are a premium member. I wish when I cast music to TV... I could choose an option to view lyrics like I can on my phone! Also I wish it could have a feature to not drain my phone for just listening to music. My daughter will use other apps for music that are music only because of this sometimes.
"Overall I'm pretty pleased after Google Music became YouTube Music. There's a couple things it still misses. Having a list of recent plays for the last 30 albums you listened to was a big plus for Google music, the YouTube music is close but it slips into stuff you listen to more often. Also it's a bit glitchy starting up songs. Takes 5-10 seconds sometimes and I haven't figured out why."
"I am an early adopter of Google's efforts at a streaming music player. I was quite happy with the progress on Play music app but for some reason Google decided to kill it and integrate a music player into YouTube. I am all for integration when done right, but this app lacks several features it's core competitors have and it's own predecessor had. For starters, I would like a total rehaul and update of the Lyrics section. I would also like to see the Year in Review feature others have."
"YouTube music is much better than Spotify but my only issue is that the volume is different on almost every song. Their needs to be volume stabilization other than that I really enjoy it. I listen to a lot of different music but my favorites are Big Band Jazz from the 1920s to the 1940s and YouTube music has a much more vast catalog than Spotify. I also listen to Hip Hop, R&B, Rap from the late 1990s to the early 2000s and again the catalog is enormous along with videos of the era."
"So far so good, quality of music is good and I like the upload option to be able to add my own library to the service, a service that alot of streaming platforms have abandoned. Do wish album artwork was a little more obtained. for such a large company I'm seeing a lot of holes in products that if we're added pixel and Google users would have no reason to switch. Hoping with the popularity of the pixel their services will start to add missing features that are pretty standard."
"I have loved using this app, is been great for a lot of music selection, and playing music from my sd card. But the most recent update is... STUPID! The library is nearly impossible to use anymore, like even just today, I just created a playlist, and can't find it!! Other than that, is been great."
"This app is WAYYY better than stupid Spotify. Number one, Spotify is completely useless and utterly frustrating without premium. It's like their begging for you to buy it like dogs. Two, although YouTube Music cannot play music out of app, that is fine. Plus, having no internet and no playable songs are okay. Third, It lets you choose specific songs you'd like, and pick songs to listen to without premium or limited skips. This will be my go-to. It also has a lot of songs Spotify doesn't have!"
"Update! They've added the controls I asked for below. I'm quite happy with the app; I really really wish they'd add higher quality audio though. My phone and headphones support Bluetooth 5.1 and YouTube Music is falling behind on audio tech to use this more powerful Bluetooth coming out in phones and Spotify/AppleMusic. Old: I liked it. It sometimes traps you with a heaps of music you've already heard a lot that week, which does get annoying. If they added a button to explore more distant relat"
"Navigation is a bit obtuse, would be better with some constant buttons at the bottom of the screen rather than contextual buttons. Wish there was a way to purchase songs through the app in addition to the subscription. Also for some reason in this version of Android 13 you cannot control the app on your phone's lock screen."
"I honestly only use it b/c I have YouTube premium. There are songs you can get on YT music that aren't on other song apps (with some exceptions, ie: SoundCloud, Apple Music (rarely), BandCamp). Also, I feel like there was a way to switch between YT Music and YT in both respective apps but I either dreamed it, can't figure out how to do it anymore, or they removed this feature. I agree with the songs being removed VERY OFTEN, especially if it's songs that aren't official releases by an artist."
I love this app as it comes in handy when I'm traveling and need music that doesn't cost me anything. I've found when it drops when other apps are running is to either update when available or Uninstall and reinstall after. It's a pain but then what app doesn't have issues. No point complaining YouTube doesn't answer. That's my advice if you have any issues with it.
App is fine. No real standout features. Plays music but nothing impresses me. I'm not sure why the thumbs down option was hidden on songs. It makes it harder to curate the super mixes which tend to be overaggressive on their recommendations after you watch a one off video on YouTube. Edit: The new radio tuner is a very positive change
"I've had the YouTube Music app ever since Google Play Music shut down and had to transfer all my music, which was over at least 5000 songs. The only thing I didn't like was that YTM didn't save my playlists exactly how I had them on GPM. GPM sorted and saved the songs in alphabetical order, which I really liked, so I could download all albums of the artists but not have to listen to just one artist at a time."
Pretty good. Always has what I'm looking for. I find it a little clunky. It's gotten better. It's one of the only apps that lets you upload your own music. I like that they have lyrics but I wish they listed the writers names. Particularly when the source they are citing includes that information. I miss liner notes.
"I've been using this app for about a year now and overall it's been pretty decent. Although the music isn't lossless quality I find it to be excellent and songs load up very quick. Being able to listen to user-uploaded content alongside official record-label uploaded content is something only available on this app so it is unique. Uploading personal music works OK, but Apple Music does this better. Switching back and forth between music and video with the toggle switch is a fantastic feature."
"(3.5 / 5.0 really) Great library but it could use better curators. The lists seem more auto-generated than hand-picked. Also lacks band and track info. When you select a band or whatever, the ""songs"" lists arent really arranged right. Just things like that that stop it from being five stars. Suits me fine though and I like also getting YouTube premium in the deal."
"Good product that could be great. I generally find who or what I'm looking for pretty quickly. After taking some time to give input on songs I like or dislike via the thumbs up and thumbs down, the playlist would definitely get more specific to my tastes then given enough time too specific and start to lack in variety or discovery so I'd have to get a little more involved in doing choices again. A bit pricey but I suppose that's part of what makes it as good as it is. All in all my favorite."
"Navigation is pretty good, still don't quite understand the difference between ""add to my library"" vs ""download"". Those should be one in the same. Please make the text bigger everywhere and add a car mode, it's very hard to read and find the small buttons when driving."
"I have grown to love this music app. And can't go a day without it!! The premium is great I can indulge in the music I love even once my phone has gone black or ""to sleep"" as well as it's commercial free.. which I enjoy very much.. . You can make your own playlist(s) and make them private or public, you can build your own library with any and all the music you wish. Always has the new and upcoming artists and/or the newly released music to choose from!"
"Using the app is great, but I went from paying 11.99 a month, to variable rates around $40 that I can't figure out. Trying to navigate the accounts in Google has not been easy. Also, I started with Pandora and like it's operating software much better. I'm keeping this app for now since I think it's linked to the YouTube videos I like to watch."
"Like any other app that has you ""like/dislike"" songs. This app plays songs based on those likes and the genre selected. After a few years of use I can safely say that it rarely plays something I don't like, and yet I still hear new things. So why this app? Well with YT premium, it plays with the screen off, doesn't use much bandwidth or battery, and let's me download unlimited songs including 10hr YT help sleep at night music."
I prefer yt music over spotify bc there's a bigger selection (spotify keeps getting rid songs i like??) and its easier to just keep playing music. Like i can play a playlist and then when it ends yt will just play more songs. What i DON'T like is the playlist management. How tf do i delete songs from a playlist in the app??? I can do it on a computer but that's frustrating. So I just keep pushing songs i don't want anymore to the end lol
"Youtube music is a good app to listen music from. However, the sound quality can be improved. For instance, I like mexican regional music and when playing my favorite songs, poor sound quality can be disappointing due to song sounding so low despite having my car volume almost at its peak. I hope this improves because YouTube music is becoming almost my daily music streamer."
"Not too bad, better than Spotify and much better than Pandora!! Love that it has access to any song on YouTube. A few glitches every once in awhile but overall it's worth my money.Also I like the download playlist for when I'm not around service, I live in the mountains and service is very spotty so it's nice to still have my Bryson Gray bumping!!"
I love this app it's my absolute favorite app for listening and finding music...however when using Bluetooth headphones for some reason the app will randomly decide to stop using my custom equalizer settings which is very annoying because I'm an audiophile and sound is very important to me. All in all besides the aforementioned issue amazing work!
I love using YouTube music. I get access to all my favorite songs even ones that aren't on Spotify. What would make it even better is if you guys gave us the option to look up specific songs on our Playlist so we don't have to scroll forever to find the song we are looking for. Also you guys should put YouTube music on Playstation so we could game and listen to music at the same time. Other than that 8/10
"Update, they've made many improvements to make it similar to the old GPM. Took WAY too long to get these features in. Hey how about you build a reliable app with many features before straight cutting the old app? Anyways, still misses a few basics from the old app but way better. Can confidently recommend it for my family who has a library of songs they own from many years."
"I originally had given a very negative review. Transitioning from Google Play Music was frustrating and aggravating. I finally succumbed to YouTube paid subscription. It was a tough and long learning curve, but I am now really enjoying the service. Changes that I disliked initially, I do enjoy now."
"Overall I'd say it's absolutely the best music app I have ever used. The only negative thing I would put on it is when you like or ""thumb up"" 2 or 3 songs from the same artist that artist will get played a bit more than you might like when your trying to listen to a over-all mix list."
This app was fine until Google started constantly changing things around. And now it loads slower and some album covers don't show when listening to downloaded music. The shuffle feature is not a true shuffle. Plays the same order each time unless you tap shuffle a few times. Most annoying are the playlists Google chooses to add to your library. Most have all of the songs on the playlists I have created. PLEASE stop that. And please bring back the genre section of the library. GP was much better
The music quality is very good and the app is pretty nice to use. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars and use Spotify more often is that I can't use it on multiple devices and seamlessly transition the same way. That feature alone would make me drop any other app and use YT Music exclusively.
Updated review. They've made some pretty good improvements in connectivity and stability. Increased my rating from three stars to four stars because of that. Still only four stars because Artist and track radio used to be much better. Now it plays deep cuts from obscure artists that aren't even really that close to what they are supposed to be based upon.
"Great app I use constantly. I have Premium and recommend it to all my friends and family. Three things I would change. I miss the shuffle button being more prominent in play list, so please bring it back. I also wish the default organization for my music was alphabetical like it used to be instead of recent activity. Lastly, I would hope all videos on YouTube, or at the least the music posts, would be available on YouTube Music. Especially for people who pay for premium."
"Love youtube music. I like the auto-generated stations and the ability to put a mood/genre filter on a radio station. Some features I'd love to see: It would be cool if I could select 2 or more filters (such as workout/rock radio) It would be cool if you could ""re-roll"" a saved radio station. So let's say I have a saved radio station, it would be really cool to be able empty the radio station and refill it with new songs. Maybe slightly alter the selection of songs based on recent activity."
"Great app have never not found a song I was looking for. I love the mix tapes and suggested playlists, and the lyric tab and related music tab are perfect. Can add a song to play next or and to the playlist. Don't like if I accidentally tap a song to start right now it completely deletes all the music I had qued up and will not go back to it no matter what!!!! Sometimes I've spent 20mins on a list and boom GONE!! SMH can we get a back button or an ""do you want to abandon this"" pop-up please!!"
"definitely the best music app especially for youtube users and creators, I've been using it for at lesst six years. but, it's lacking features even after such a long time such as a desktop app, support for songs not categorized as music, crossfade, custom playlist icons and playlist collaboration. its still very good but certainly needs updates."
"It's mostly fine, but playback will either (via convenient toggle) set the entire playlist to the album version or the music video version. This sounds okay, but, if there are differences between the music video version and the album version (or if they are incorrectly paired to begin with), and your playlist isn't all one format or the other, you'll have to manually switch it each time for those songs, which means it won't work for a set-and-forget playlist, which is unfortunate. 7/10"
"Overall this app is fantastic for finding and playing music. It is also great for building a library with albums and playlists. The biggest downside to this app is when songs become unavailable. They still show when searching for them, but are marked as unavailable. No reason is given as to why songs do that. You could play a song or album for years and then one day find it is marked unavailable and can no longer play it."
"App works really well for what I use it for. I like that it has a lot of easy to find foreign language songs, and the ability to make a playlist out of my liked music. I do feel like the mixes and premade playlists are quite bad though, and YouTube music has a strong tendency to only play a small set of songs repeatedly. Even when you start a ""radio"" off an unrelated song. Generally easy to use, and has everything you could want from a music app. Just wish the AI was better at finding new music."
"Over all its not terrible I think it has a lot of potential. The primary problem I have is its functionality with the Google digital assistant. (Edit) The app is now much better integrated with the Google Assistant. However, the app divides your ability to make playlists out of local music and cloud music. It wasn't like this before so I know it's possible. I wish they'd change it back."
"Great app, great features, YouTube premium is amazing, you can download for offline use, even play music videos as songs. I can't speak on the ads as I am paying for premium. Could use a function to play regular videos as songs too. The biggest con for me is if you have downloaded a playlist and an album, both with the same song in it, you will get an error. You have to delete all of your downloads. I think it has to do with how they authorize it's use."
It's a very good app. You can set it up to your music preferences. You can also setup specific playlists as well. Songs come with lyrics but some lyrics aren't verbatim to the song playing. Sometimes lyrics don't belong to that song at all or you get no lyrics. Various functions don't work sometimes. Adding songs to your personalized playlist can be tricky at times and a bit confusing and frustrating. App. will make song suggestions based on play history and your likes. Overall recommend.
"Most of the time, I have great signal playing my music. Lately though, I'll start playing music and the song will start buffering and then the app shuts down completely. I've never had an issue like this before and I've had this app for a few years now. I pay to listen and be able to download, so it's frustrating when I can't listen to my songs! This is the only music app I pay for bc I just generally like it. Please fix the bugs!!!"
"YouTube Music is pretty good. The premade ""personalized"" playlists are decent once you've used the app for a while. I wish there was something to even out the volume levels between tracks. One track will be loud and the next, quiet, leaving you a adjust the volume constantly. It'd be nice if there was a feature to fade from one track to another also. I miss that feature from the original Google Play Music."
"Feature suggestion: I'm really excited about this one. Incognito mode listening...! Practical uses for it: I listen to calm music while I fall asleep, so it suggests a lot of that type of music when I don't really care for it outside of falling asleep. Wouldn't want the boys thinking I listen to country music when I'm just curious what a specific song sounds like. Who ever said ""let's have less privacy features""? No one."
"I use this app as the primary mode for listening to music! I love that I can download and listen to music that may not be mainstream or even listed on other music platforms! The radio stations that play similar music are very decent and has introduced me to new artists. No ads is a super plus! The only con is that I wish all music could be the same sound level. Some songs are louder than others and when listing to a playlist, this can be difficult."
"The app was perfectly fine before the most recent update, December 3rd, 2022 as of writing, but now the widget in my notification bar won't work, it just randomly decides to stop playing music, the music stutters and lags sometimes, and the app is generally slower and clunkier. I don't know what they did to completely break everything but it really needs to get fixed. (I have a Samsung, I don't know how Apple is handling the update)"
"Very good app with great autoplay suggestions and overall UI. This app NEEDS to change the position of the status update thing though. For example, let's say I add a song to the queue accidentally. A popup says ""[song] added to the queue"" at the bottom of the screen. I want to take it off, so I try to click the Up Next button at the bottom of the player. I can't. The update popup block the button for around five seconds, which is super frustrating. Aside from that I would give five stars."
"Love the variety of options provided by this service. The bugs with streaming and user interface has greatly decreased since I start using it five years ago. However, I have two complaints: 1- The volume is inconsistent depending on the quality of the upload and that impacts the playback expirence on playlists. 2- The algorithm doesn't work as well on other devices. It is harder to get the same search returns when I am accessing my account via PC or smart TV."
"I love youtube music so far!! I purchased premium back in December. But I think it needs a better shuffling system. It will play songs I just heard, the cycle is short, it tends to stay in the same albums if they're in a playlist, etc. So that can be kind of annoying, but it's not a deal breaker. My other hope is that a timer is eventually added in settings, as I like to listen to music to fall asleep, but I don't want it to play all night if I'm not awake. But I definitely recommend!"
"I like it, but the algorithm needs work. If you listen to a particular genre, it seems to struggle with changing genres. For example, if you listen to lots of metal, or just go on a metal binge for a couple days, and then start an All Time Low radio, it keeps putting metal into the mix. It will also favor the metal flavor when building your playlists. It feels like you have to retrain it constantly. Also, liking or disliking songs seems to muddle the algorithm and make the radios worse.."
"Overall, I really appreciate this app. There is access to so much great music. The only thing I would really improve is the quality of music resolution. Amazon music and others are doing high-resolution playback and download. I feel that if YouTube music wants to stay relevant and competitive, they will go with a high-resolution listening experience."
"The premium option is amazing, you can listen to almost any song, download it, close the app, and no ads. Though the free version is just kinda bad. An insane amount of ads, can get really annoying. Can't close the app. Aside from that, you can get really good recommendations and find just about any artist. It also introduces you to community Playlist and personal Playlist for you. You can skip any song and listen to any song anytime. The premium is 9.99 US"
"I give it a 4/5 star because it works very well. Sadly, I feel the new update I got with the strange ""new and more accessible Library"" is a little bit of a bother to me. The 'Downloaded Songs' automatic playlist that was there has now disappeared, and the placement of the ""Shuffle"" and ""Add New Playlist"" buttons are in places that I commonly touch... I don't know if it's just me or if anyone else feels the way I do. I enjoyed the old version from a month ago... this is, of course, my opinion."
"I love the way that Google apps work almost seamlessly across the platform but they need to make improvements in the app. In the Playlist you need to be able to sort (e.g. alphabetically by title or singer), and you need to be able to delete a song from the Playlist (whether it's on the cloud or downloaded), both from the list or when the song us playing. So many other shortcomings but I use it as my main music streaming app."
