"This is one of the few games that always gets installed when I change devices. It's challenging enough to keep my ADHD brain engaged but not so complicated or impossible to progress that I lose interest. It loads fast, so it's perfect for just killing time. No stress mode means it you fall you can just get up and keep going. You can buy stuff but can still enjoy it you don't."
"I've had the Alto games on my phones for longer than any other game/app I've ever had. Its one of my go-to downloads when I get a new phone. It may not be the most action-packed game but its reliable in its beautiful visuals and easy-going but exciting gameplay. I couldn't recommend a better game for those trying to kill 2 minutes or 20, it serves the purpose."
"I love this game so the much. The graphics are incredible but also soothing and simple at the same time. A lot of reviews say that the ads are overwhelming, but you can just hop off the wifi!! I love the Zen setting and the characters are great. 10 out of 10 would totally recommend!! It's not fast-paced but if you're trying to chill or you don't want a crazy game this is perfect!"
"This is one of those apps that REALLY nails the balancing of ads. It gives you an ad every now and then but its not every time you die and you can skip it within a few seconds. if you want to revive your character, you can watch a 30 second ad but its OPTIONAL. Great game. Couple bugs where landing on a rock kills you but other than that great game."
"Absolutely beautiful game. I've taken at least ten photos so far. The mechanics and the physics are easy to understand. Sometimes it's just a little buggy, like sound not syncing up quite right, lag after crashing, weird visual glitches, but all of those things are super rare. The charm, beauty, and intuitive controls easily make up for it, and I'm sure the bugs will be fixed in the future. Only real complaint is that sometimes it's hard to tell obstacles apart from scenery, especially at night."
"This game is super relaxing. The art style is nice and simplistic, but still retains some beautiful environments. The controls and mechanics are very simple, making the game very easy to pick up. The landscape changes each time you play, and progressively gets more difficult to traverse, keeping the game interesting. The in-game progression is very linear with only a few upgrades and skins to unlock. Ads are included in-game, but are neither intrusive nor aggressive."
"Played the first one but this game is something else. Beautiful, smooth, fun, calming, and overall a good game! Love the weather changes and background of the game! This is the go to if I have time to kill or want to play something. The challenges are not too hard but not too easy. A bunch of different gadgets and players to choose from! The ads are not annoying at all because they are just little boxes instead of videos! The wall riding and backflips are very exciting! Great job on this game!"
"I don't usually leave reviews but I'm making an exception for this game. It's amazing. The controls are simple, the graphics blow me away every time I restart, the slow mo's and cinematic shots are more beautiful than I've seen in any other game and the progression is fun and makes you feel like you're always working towards something. The game has an amount of difficulty that makes you keep coming back but not so difficult that its frustrating. The character unlocks with levels are awesome and keep the game fresh as you play allowing you to go for insane trick combos with some and to feel like you're going faster than a Maserati with others. I could literally talk about how good this game is all day and it's still free. This game is amazing... the end"
This game is beautiful executed. The music is exciting. The visuals are clean and interesting. The way it runs is smooth and flows well. The only problem I had with it was for a good 30 seconds the music started glitching and eventually just stopped. I'm sure you can easily fix it. This game is a big accomplishment. You should be proud. (Edit) The starting music has stopped completely and the glitching has gotten worse. Please fix this soon!
"Extremely difficult and rewarding to match! It actually feels like you're learning an athletic skill- endless grinding and constant failure. Absolutely one of my favorite mobile games. The mindful aspect is so good, the constant changing biomes add to the difficulty and sense of reality, as well as always keeping it from being boring. It seems to expect you to watch ads, is the only downside, but the game is free without pay-to-win, so that's not a real downside? 9.5/10"
"This game is a keeper. The graphics alone pull you in with a minimalist design that is deceptively detailed. The gameplay is smooth and pushes you to beat your best. And the music is equally beautiful and fits the game perfectly. Getting used to all the player's different boarding styles keeps you engulfed and entertained, but if I had to gripe about anything, it would be the ads. Otherwise, it's a great game that I'd recommend to everyone!"
"This game is awesome! The art is beautiful and gameplay is so smooth. It's pretty easy to learn but hard to master all the timings for the flips and tricks. I've only encountered a couple glitches like falling through a grind when I should land on it, and flips/loops not registering, but they don't happen that often. I look forward to the next game this studio makes!"
"I am so in love with this game. The gameplay is super fun and the challenges keep me busy, the music is literally so relaxing that it helps me with my anxiety and sleeping, and the graphics are beautiful! This game is amazing! (P.S. everyone who did sound design did SO GOOD. I literally lose my mind every time I get to hear the song and the birds and lemurs in the original mode. And the way it changes from night to day or from place to place? So smooth. So nice to look at. I love.)"
"This little adventure is AWESOME. I've enjoyed games from Dark Souls to Tetris, and this game is just what I was looking for. It's quick to learn, seamless, and very relaxing with simple controls. Despite its simplicity, gameplay stays fresh through dynamic artwork, new obstacles and mechanics, and a musical score that you won't be able to get out of your head. 11\10, I hope to see more apps of this quality from the developer."
"This game is art! It's like candy for your eyes. Very fun and relaxing casual game. Music and sounds are great. Animation is smooth. Gameplay is easy to learn, easy to master. Chaining multiple tricks without touching the ground is always fun to execute. The wingsuit can really be a life-saver when jumping across huge chasms. The only problem I have with the game is that it does not use the full screen if you have a notch or hole-punch display. Other games like Smashy Road 2 don't have this problem. So hopefully the devs get this fixed soon."
"This is a perfect example of creators who care about their game. Perfect sequel to Adventure. The visuals are perfect and they are so beautiful to look at. The tricks and combos you can make add to the satisfaction of playing. The goals are tricky but rewarding when you unlock the next character. There are barely ads, don't know why people wrote pointless reviews saying they are everywhere. You get then once every 5 tries roughly and they are only 30 seconds or skippable. I've finished the game."
"If you have difficulty with visual/sensory processing like I do, this game might not work for you. The character is very small and stays in one spot while the background moves, and the speed of the movement changes depending on what's happening. I really struggled to see what was happening and ended up nauseous with a headache. I rated 5 stars because it seems like a beautiful and well designed game, and I'm not sure any game with similar mechanics would be easy to make accessible to me"
"I absolutely LOVE this game. I've been playing it for at least 3 years now across 3 different phones and finally decided to leave a review. The visuals are simple but beautiful, the gameplay is great, and I can't forget to mention the amazing soundtrack. This game is absolutely worth your time and it gets a 10/10 from me. There is something I have noticed on my new phone though: i don't feel like this game is running at 90hz despite my display being forced to."
"Gorgeous Game. The controls are easy to master, but the game play makes it fun and challenging. The ads are significant, but well-integrated so as not to be frustrating. Conquering the game goals takes practice and patience, but can be easily accomplished without a purchase. The background graphics are so spectacular they can be distracting. I once crashed while glimpsing a solar eclipse setting behind a purple mountain range under a sky speckled with hot-air balloons."
"I'm so happy there's more to this game. I love the original and this one is great too. The noises as always are my favorite, the soundtrack is beautiful, which is no surprise, and the sound effects are like asmr. I love the new look for Maya. I love the balloons. I have few complaints about the game. My main issues are just disliking some parts of gameplay and not technical issues. I don't enjoy vines, I don't like how they snap at the end. I also dont like the walls that much. I find that with the color that if my phone brightness isnt high enough and it's not high noon in tbe game, I cant see my path on the wall to know if I'm on it, and I find that wall jumps are not as easy as I thought, but that's more my problem. Another issue is that I got the wireless radio and when I get it, the air drop happens at an awkward distance and place, so I rarely actually get the packages. This game is definitely harder than the original but not in a stressful way, it is still fun and beautiful."
"Oh my goodness. Even though it's just a desert version of Alto's Adventure, it's still amazing. The graphics are even more beautiful, with warm colors, especially during sandstorms. The music and sound affects are so aesthetically pleasing and it's easy to lose yourself in it. It's so smooth and I've found 0 bugs. I highly recommended trying this out, and if you like games similar, try Alto's Adventure."
"Alto's Odyssey is a wonderful game. The gameplay mechanics are simple, and easy to learn, but the game stays interesting. I was hooked by the first iteration of Alto's Adventure, and loved it so much I downloaded Odyssey. I'm glad I did. The visuals are stunning, and unique, and the new biomes are outstanding. Just a word to the dev's though, it seems to lag a bit sometimes if you're chased by a lemur and jumping a chasm. Also sky glitches when I crash or break rocks, still an awesome game."
"It's great for those who like these type of games, and in my opinion, the ads aren't as intrusive as other games. Alto's Odyssey is addicting and once you start playing you can't stop. The fun thing about it is that you can level up and the game has 3 goals for you to accomplish and once you finished that, it randomly generates different goals for you to achieve again. Plus you can do lots of tricks which adds up points to your score on the upper right corner!"
"As a big fan of Alto's Adventure, I was sure the sequel would not be as good as the original. I""m happy to say I'm wrong. I don't play a lot of games on my phone, but this is a relaxing, visually beautiful and fun way to waste some time. Odyssey has added new things to do, such as grinding on a wall, bouncing off balloons and skimming over water. I've enjoyed my way to Level 15 so far, and it's fun. I like games that aren't hard to master and don't require pressing a lot of buttons. Odyssey is a thoroughly enjoyable game with stunning graphics, soothing music and an easy to learn vibe. You can also play it in Zen mode and not worry about completing tasks."
"Better than the first game, which was already great. this one has the same polished feel but with more variety in landscapes (think biomes like Minecraft) and obstacles. This one has flashy ads, which interrupt the soothing aesthetic, but it's free to play. I think the last one cost $1 up front. anyway, you can pay to remove the ads if you want"
"Beautiful scenery, relaxing music, and I love how smooth it runs. I'm glad I can skip ads that come inbetween runs and that I have a choice to watch the ads for better things. I also love the leveling and quest system, it really helps so that it isn't just that simple game with nothing else to it. The only real problem I have has to be that it has a disadvantage at running if it lags even the slightest, but that normally only happens if your phone itself is laggy (my old phone kinda was)."
"This is a fantastic endless runner that takes everything great about the original and builds on it. I highly recommend purchasing some characters to support the game, though they can be unlocked by progressing through their subtle leveling system. The goals to level up your character are a great way to teach you how to think about playing the game a little differently, and they don't just feel like arbitrary numbers. This is a definite must play. <3"
"At fisrt, I thought this was just a re-textured Alto's Adventure, but then came the baloons, walls, and vines, along with some fun new challenges and increased difficulty. Although they are all very different, the different parts of the world blend together really well. Even the flow and satifaction of landing a cool trick is better then in the first game. Back then, I thought quadruple backflips were impossoble. I've played this game less, but I've landed two of them in one combo."
"TLDR; it pretty. do play. This game is gorgeous! I really enjoy the challenges and characters. If you get overwhelmed with the challenges, there's zen mode. I *love* zen mode, it's so calming! The music, the colors, everything. It is great for practicing and/or relaxing. The game sort of reminds me of temple run, but, more colorful. I also like this one just a bit more than Alto's Adventure, though, they're both awfully great. God bless!"
"Better than Altos adventure. Seems like an upgraded version that keeps the same core principle that makes it so good, but just feels a little more thought out. Paying to remove ads is also cheaper in this game which is a plus. $2 let's you continue once and play forever without ads. Definitely worth it to not have your zen experience broken up. All in all just awesome game to zone in to."
"This is an exceptional game. The combination of great visual design, simple controls, and beautiful music make for a fun, fluid and relaxing experience. The challenges, ""levels"" add incentive for repeated runs and daring moves. The game is perfect as is, but if I were to suggest any additions, I would include something like a guardian of each biome that chases you (similar to the lemurs) forcing more pressure on you to pull off more tricks and gain more speed. A multiplayer race option might be a fun addition too. Any future development plans are welcome, but please use the same composer!"
"Something always enjoyable to play, art, soundtrack, and gamplay are all fantastic. Ads are every four runs or so, but the zen mode you can play forever with no ads. Unlocks are obtainable, a little grindy, but alright. You have a good sense of progression, but that slows down a lot later in the game. I can't wait for another Alto game, I would love to see a racing or multiplayer version of Alto in the future. Or something trials like. And just a little more unlocks, like equipment or something."
"Absolutely stunning graphics and very simple controls, but also very challenging with obstacles and adjustments in scenery. I like the leveling and character / equipment unlocking as you fulfill goals in the game. I also love the Zen Mode for when I don't want to worry about scores or achievements - the music they play is relaxing and beautiful. I would highly recommend it for anyone."
"When my internet and/or data don't work, this is my game, I mean it's like an endless platformer/runner game, but with the most beautiful and realistic audio and just astonishing gameplay graphics and content. Another thing I love is that this game has in-app purchases, but they're all so much cheaper than the other games and it doesn't force you to buy anything. At this point, for how amazing the ""Alto"" games are, I want to buy the ad remover JUST so I can give back to the team this Christmas."
"This game is perfect for road trips, or If you are bored and have nothing to do. The zen mode is especially perfect to be non rage enducing. The controls are super easy for new players, and the tutorial was very clear. I was surprised by the graphics they are much better than most mobile games. Also the fact that Alto is an offline game means you can play it no matter where you are. Overall an amazing game I hight recommend."
"This is a game for anyone. It has user-friendly controls, amazing graphics, peaceful music, and great gameplay. It gets better the more you play and the more time you put into it. It even has a zen mode, which I'd highly suggest you look at after getting the wingsuit. 10/10 Perfect game for anytime and anyone, even offline."
"Hands down the BEST mobile game I have ever played. The controls couldn't be simpler and the gameplay is super easy to pick up but remains challenging thanks to the leveling objectives. The different characters aren't too hard to unlock and they're a great way to cater to your playstyle. The upgrades feel a bit expensive but they're totally achievable without spending any money if you put in the time. The visuals and sound are beautiful, and best of all there's very few adss"
"Fun, incredibly relaxing, and equipped with amazing sound effects and visuals. I haven't found any bugs, the app runs smoothly, and ads are spaced put perfectly to the point that they don't affect gameplay all that much. Game concept is simple to understand, and the levels advance with your skill. Both competitive and relaxing."
"What a gorgeous game! The gameplay is smooth and pretty much 100% bug-free. Level progression is challenging, but not frustrating. Everything about this game is lovely, endearing, and honestly just plain fun, which is what other super-smooth games sometimes lack. Alto's Adventure, though itself imperfect, was a great preface to this masterpiece. Bravo."
"This game is a visual masterpiece with gameplay that would get you to stay for hours on ends just trying and trying to get farther, complete every challenge, and master the beautifully designed controls. With very little ads and very much gameplay you can't go wrong, and it's astounding that all this is free. You truly can't find this type of content anywhere else. I give this a 10/10, would board again."
"Its a wonderful predecessor to Alto's adventure, the art work is beautiful as is the soundtrack. They improved on the game mechanics and add new features like wall grinding, tornadoes and the compass which lets you choose the biome you wish to play in (for a small fee of course), but it helps when you have a specific goal in a certain biome. Overall this is a good game and i recommend downloading!!"
"I had this game a couple years ago, and for some reason deleted it to clear space, I guess. But I couldn't stop thinking about it! I have the music in my playlists and even made fanart, so I came back years later once my brother got it and reminded me lol. All in all, wonderful game, easy to learn, hard to master. Incredible art and aesthetic! Highly recommend."
"It's so beautiful! I love how the time of day changes, but besides visuals, the controls felt so fluent. A wall glide felt gracefull and quick, but the gong and the feeling when you fall felt sharp and unexpcted. I really like the Zen setting, not to mention the music that plays the entire time. And above all that, its free! Really nice game. 5 stars."
"Amazing game, just like the first. The addition of the new mechanics keep it fresh while not taking it too far away from what made the original so great. My one problem is that I get massive frame drops on the game if I have literally any other app running in the background on my LG G6. EDIT- 10-7-19- I have since upgraded to the LG G7 and I haven't had any issues with frame drops, therefore making this the most perfect game ever."
"Pretty much phenomenal, but new players should know that it's a pretty slow start, the game may at first seem underwhelming, but I urge you to play until you unlock your first new character, that combined with learning how the game handles will quickly improve your experience. My only request to the devs is to make the characters a little more animated, especially when they're riding at a moderate speed, or jumping without flipping, injecting a little more life can really boost the immersion. <3"
"This game is so very heavenly. It is very relaxing and fun. Not only is it fantastic, but the progression is done well. After a while, it can be tedious to have to complete ten levels to unlock the next character, but getting the different locations and items at the beginning and middle of the game is very satisfying. Zen mode is absolutely stunning. The music is beautiful and it is a very relaxing experience. Also the camera mode is a nice touch. I suggesthis game if you want something relaxing"
"I really like this game! But I have somd suggestions. Can you make some distinction of a rock from any other item? Because the rocks sometimes look like the bushes or background. Make it glow or something. Also, can you make a thing where you can make your own character? Customize it, and maybe even add some kind of customization with alto. Like power upps or abilities. Thank you for considering! <3"
"PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF SOUTHPAWS, could you add an option to put the wingsuit on the other side of the screen, like you do for the pause button? My one pet peeve with this game is that its impossible for me to avoid accidentally activating the wingsuit at inopportune times because it's right under my thumb, in the middle of the left side of the screen. Other than that, great game. 10/10."
"Probably my favorite free mobile game. It's relaxing, yet exciting when I want it to be. It's always fun either way. Game manages to be entertaining while having such simple mechanics. The physics are smooth and satisfying. And perhaps the best thing the game has going for it is its amazing atmosphere. I think it could use some more new, unique terrain and obstacles. It gets just a bit repetitive after a certain time of playing the game."
"just the atmosphere of the game is so calm. i love the music and the graphics and the texture of everything in the game. it's genuinely one mobile game i actually keep going back to. and the only on I've ever left a written rating for lol. the only thing is that sometimes the game glitches out and i can't catch on a ledge or just clip through something, but that's very rare"
"Ita my go-to casual game. Nice serene atmosphere, easy to use controls. Always has a tendency to bring me peace. It could use a fast travel option tho, especially in the later game, to advance the map 1000m or 1500m. It just seems the early portion of the maps tend to be a bit slow & dull, sometimes on a short session during a break I'd like to just jump right into the faster paced, point building portion"
"I'm only a couple of sittings in, but this game is dope. It's simple, but fast and beautiful. Upgrading isn't a pain. Adds are noninvasive. I like to play at night in bed before going to sleep. The music is soothing but upbeat. The visual flow is wavy. And most importantly, the game play is fun- all with just thumb tapping. Nice job!"
"[Even Better than the Original] Alto's Odyssey is a therapeutic masterpiece with a gorgeous simplified artstyle, immersive dynamic music, and simple, yet intuitive controls. Noodlecake improves upon the original with the inclusion of dynamic weather and the addition of multiple different biomes, each with unique gameplay elements that keep the game feeling fresh every time you play. Also, Zen Mode once again proves to be the best thing since sliced bread. This game really is a must-have."
"Extremely relaxing and a great time killer. The addition of biomes, vines, balloons, etc. Make this game even better than Alto's Adventure, which was my favorite game for a long time. The objectives become progressively more challenging and are fun to do with friends. The graphics are beautiful, especially the background which is morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and night. I am delighted to say that this game is free and the only thing anyone needs to pay for is the game money which is easily obtained. There are adds when you want easy game money and adds do not disturb the gaming experience. The music is extremely relaxing and fits very well with the graphics. It's all together the best game I have seen in a very long time."
"Phenomenal game. Minimal ads, beautiful aesthetic and amazing, innovative gameplay. It's nuts what Team Alto can do with just one input type. This is a perfect successor to Alto's Adventure (except for the lack of llamas :/) and is just a blast to play. I have, on multiple occasions, chosen this game over a console video game or movie. Seriously, it's that good. Check it out."
"Unfortunately, I usually have to play with my sound off which detracts a lot from this game's spirit, but even without sound its a fun relaxing time wasting game. I love the art style and the controls are perfect for phone play. I highly recommend this to anyone on the fencd. FYI, I spent the $2 to remove the intrusive ads that pop up occasionally between rounds but that was well worth it with how often I bite the dirt."
"I absolutely love this game, but there's one problem that really annoys me. Whenever I try to login to Google Play Games, the drop down icon with the message ""Connecting to Google Play Games"" shows up for about half a second, goes away, and locks the game up. Really wish there were some way to fix this, so that I could transfer my progress to a different device. Might not be the developer's fault, but annoying nonetheless. EDIT: Fixed by using different account. 5 stars!"
"I love this game! It's so beautiful and the music is wonderful. But, I can't get very far in Zen mode without the app crashing. It might just be my phone though (it's a Galaxy s7; I've had it for 3 years now and I've dropped it several dozen times, so maybe it's decided it will quit on me now). But regardless, I'm loving the game!"
"The game is great it's controls are simple but fun for them to become effortless. The graphics of the foreground, background and where you are blend making it sometimes unclear where the obstacles are. The way you level up is simple and requires you to slowly get good to progress."
"Cannot recommend this game enough. It's beautiful, polished, and the ads are minimal, and are clearly only there so you can support the creators with no excessive amount of them. Gameplay is interesting while being simple, and there's no predatory practice in it. This is one of the few mobile titles i can call truly art. If you haven't tried it, you don't know what you're missing."
I never leave reviews but I think this game deserves it. Super relaxing and or challenging depending on how you want to play. Jumping around mountains and off balloons and walls and watching combo numbers go up and seeing really cool background art and well done abilities... Just a great casual game. It was worth the couple bucks to get rid of ads and support the creators. Cant wait for the next one.
"I loved the original game, but this took the experience to a whole new level. More upgrades, a new board specifically for sand, and the ability to wallride make this by far the best free game of its type. Works flawlessly on my phone, and still contains a zen mode with the right music and attitude to make even the longest flights fly by. A must have if you like snowboard games and lemurs!"
"ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. I played the first game for well over a year and I was in love with it. When I found out about Odyssey, I immediately smashed the install button. They brought back everything from the first game with a different background and soundtrack. At first, I was just content with replaying an old favorite, but then I discovered new game mechanics: tornados, balloons, wall riding, parrots, sandstorms, zone changes. Everything is seamless. This is Noodlecake's greatest triumph."
"I have reset the game again, for the 5th time, so I can play it all from beginning to end... Again. For the game editors, it really sucks when you start to fall in a chasm and the moment you cross that threshold, instantly that turn is over. It would be nice if you had a chance to wingsuit or wall ride out. Lower the threshold so you don't automatically die! Nice game though!"
"This is hands down, the best mobile game ever. The controls are simple. The gameplay is straightforward and addictive. It isn't a giant cashgrab either. There's in-app purchases sure, but you don't need real world money just to play. And yes there's ads, but the game's free, what are you expecting? The game is incredibly relaxing. Soft music, visually appealing graphics, and a calm play style. I've never been so at ease when constantly dying in a game. Except for the lemurs. I hate those things."
"I love Alto's Odyssey as a casual and satisfying game. I can slide on a rock, I can still do 50 backflips as Maya, rack up trick points with Izel, and I can watch more scenic art while doing an epic combo on some balloons. The trick to getting minimal ads is to main a character and get good. If you sucked like me, play as Maya. The longer you live in this game, the less you'll feel of ads bombarding you. I just wish the Zen mode could show the points you get from doing a cool trick combo."
"It is really a beautiful game! Graphics are good, music is good, sound effects are good, everything's good! But there's a flaw. The music is gone on my Pixel 3 XL running Android 11. No music, only SFX left. But everything works perfectly fine on my Pixel 1 XL running Android 10. Please fix this 'cause music is really a major part of this game! PS. I've checked my settings on both phones and the music turned up to max."
"This game is great, it has everything you should want plus more. The controls are simple yet effective, the pacing is great, there is variety of ways you can play, and the atmosphere is what brings the game together, it is calming at times, and a little less calming at other times. Overall this game is an amazing experience, I'd recommend it anyone."
Far better than the 1st one. It's nice to simply zone out and plod along. Beautiful scenery and good graphics/music make this an awesome airport game. My only complaint is the contrast in night-mode is SO POOR that you're practically guessing where rocks/jumps are. Since it's completely randomized timing you'll be praying the sun stays up when you're on a streak.
"Best game I played on mobile. Beautiful background, peaceful music, and not hard to level while also wasting time and seeing a wonderful landscape on a mobile game but, the ads do get annoying from time to time but, they only appear every two restarts which is great besides the ads and high prices to get upgrades the game is pretty fun to waste time on and do some grinding."
"I completed everything and have had a lot of fun playing this game. The gameplay is relaxing and the satisfying combos just feel good. The game gets even better once you unlock more characters and the wingsuit. My few complaints are that there are a lot of ads, the chasm jumps don't always work great because your momentum differs, and there should be more missions for long time players which would be very easy to add. I would still reccomend, one of my favorite mobile games in a while."
"This is the game I've been playing the most on my phone. Simple yet fun, with immersive biomes, a sense of progression, and good music. Only specific issue I have is that if you are on wifi but it is poor then it eternally tries to connect to Google play. If your network has internet access or if your wifi is off, then that's not an issue."
"I have nothing to say that no one else has said. The game has good graphics, fun game mechanics, different play styles, is addicting and a good way to kill time if say you're bored on a car, has a little amount of adds, the tricks are very fun to do my only problem is that the game in extremely rare cases glitches out and I once got a Penta back flip and I don't think the devs expected someone to be able to pull that of and it didn't give me points for it and I lost my back flip points"
"I left a similar review giving praise to the simple yet enjoyable gameplay, stunning and minimalist graphics, and soothing music on Alto's Adventure but felt compelled to leave one here as well. I love these games and highly recommend them. Odyssey is basically a re-skin of Adventure but set in the desert instead of mountains with a few more gameplay aspects but that doesn't make the game any less enjoyable and I'll still keep both downloaded on my phone."
"This game is really good if you have nothing to do and want to kill time, it's a really great sequal(?) To alto's adventure and it's a lot more beautiful and packed with new things to do/areas to explore. Zen mode is great as well because you can play the game stress free and not have to worry about goals or mistakes. The new mechanics are all really awesome, I don't like the vines for the reason that they break off without any warning and that's really annoying. Overall great little mobile game"
"The graphics and gameplay are both great! I love the atmospheric details from the time of day to different weather and it makes it beautiful and unique to look at. This is a game all about reaction time but it's not too difficult, and it feels amazing to chain together multiple tricks! Very smooth and entertaining. I like all the little character blurbs as well, and how I keep discovering more the further I get on runs. Overall, would highly recommend!"
"I'm not usually one for mobile games, but I saw this one and thought I'd try it. I was enthralled by the smooth graphics, clean design, and peaceful music. The gameplay is simple yet challenging and I found myself coming back more and more. Then I discovered Zen mode and fell in love. Definitely recommending this game!"
"I almost never write reviews, bit his game has more than exceeded my expectations. It's fun, simple, and absolutely gorgeous. The controls are basic and easy to get used to, and the gameplay itself is simple and addictive. The graphics are probably my favorite part, however. The colors are so vibrant and they work extremely well together. The only negative is that this app drains power a little quickly, but it's definitely worth it. tl;dr The app is simple, fun, and beautiful, but it makes the battery drain somewhat quickly. Totally worth the download."
"It's one of the few games out there on the play store today that is actually playable and fun without having ads shoved in your face every two seconds. But that's not all the gameplay is very fun, and it feels amazing getting good at the game and doing triple back flip combos! I'd highly recommend anyone to play this game if they get the chance."
Omg it's amazing! The scenery changes from temples to storms to sun rises and sundown. There are plenty of challenges in it too. And the music and sound effects are great and there are different characters you can unlock. I'm in shock that this game is free because a lot of effort went it and it's the best thing ever!
This game is my number 1 for offline. I love the simple to learn yet complex factors of the game with many upgrades available for free that you can unlock through progression. It is not intense but will keep you entertained with the beautiful graphics and scenery. I especially love the zen mode where you have unlimited lives and can explore the desert without any heavy concentration. This game is great!!!
"A love letter to the original, this game has what it previous did in Adventure and brought in much more. There hasn't been a feature that I was disappointed with, and have already invested hours into playing. This game brought back the amazing music from Adventure and made it somehow even better than before. Sadly, there has been some glitched models and even lag due to how much is packed onto your screen. If that were fixed, there wouldn't be anything to complain about. Thanks NoodleCake!"
"I ADORE this game! It's so beautiful and addictive. The controls are easy to master, but the game play continues to be challenging as you go. The graphics are stunning. The music is so relaxing and engaging. Little detail that I really love - there's an equal amount of male and female characters! When you fail it's encouraging about it, like it says ""crashes happen!"" which I think is really nice. 😊 The only problem I have with it is that you can't mute some of the ads."
"This game is amazing. And I thought Alto's Adventure was fun ~ this game goes carried over the same fun elements and went above and beyond with mesmerizing visual, tranquil music, fun challenging gameplay, and new mechanics to incorporate the Desert Theme. Alto's Odyssey is definitely one of my favorite apps. My only criticism is the excessive ads. Even when I plan on watching one to continue my run, it makes me watch an additional ad, which is kinda annoying. But otherwise, this app is great."
"Best most beautiful runner. Pay these devs and get rid of the ads! Money just makes upgrades faster, which is not necessary. but paying to remove ads is, because this studio has now made two ultimate bangers and they deserve to be paid! The new elements are fantastic, the enhancement of a free life on EVERY run no matter what is (now) obvious and fun. Also I like that you DON'T get the coin doubler upon paying to remove ads! Makes the progression too fast imo."
"I have loved Alto's Adventures for many years, so I was so excited when Alto's Odyssey was released. Odyssey is beautiful and easy to lose yourself in. The challenges are not difficult, but they are still rewarding. And the overall experience of this game has always kept me coming back even when other games don't. It's a lovely game!"
"Very fun in endless mode where there's no HUD to distract you, or any failing and with headphones it is very asthtetic to just soak it all in. Overall I would definitely peg it down for best mobile game of th- Oh yes, it's flaws, there is one, and it's this glitch where it makes a low frequency buzzing and it crashes, but still, since it's the only flaw, I give it a 5/5"
"It's rare for a game to be well developed for mobile AND monetized in such a way as to not turn into a money grab vs a grind fest. Even rarer for the game to be one that encourages building skill despite the limits of simple inputs (screen tapping). Rarer still do it twice by evolving from one successful game into a similar but new game with added mechanics! Highly recommended, this game and it's predecessor (Alto's Adventure). Well done Team Alto!"
"Amazing. Its cool, fun, and the scenery is beautiful. Its so natural with the sound, nature and intractable animals. I love how there's a storm and day cycle. The only thing that kinda bugs me is that it can get a little annoying with the challenges at times, and they took out the llamas from the other game. So now there's not really an objective. Its just another running game. But besides, this game is awesome."
"This game is amazing. The graphics are beautiful, the music is great, but the one thing that struck me, was the gameplay. I love the wallridjng feature. It livens up the game with a feeling of great height, and will speed up your character by so much. Zen mode is great as well, letting you practice and perfect your playstyle."
"SPECTACULAR! Super calming and helps me get rid of stress easy. If your looking for a way to de-stress while killing time and playing games, this is the way to do it. If you dont like the ads, and just want to play the game, simply shut off your WiFi or Data and no more ads! (No more paying to remove ads!)"
"Really great gameplay, especially for a 2D/sidescroller. Love the mechanics. The artstyle is beautiful as you progress through the different areas or stages and the soundtrack is amazing. Very relaxing game. The ""wingsuit"" is an excellent element they added to motivate players to progress. It's a lot of fun."
"I never rate, but this game is classy. The ads never irritate me, they do not aggressively bombard you with ads at all, the idea of it is unique, it's just a really awesome game. It is obvious they put alot of thought and time into it. Thank you for sharing your work of art with us! I loved the first game and recently found this one. 5 stars all day long!! Thanks again!"
"This is a perfect app! The graphics are stunning, the music is calm and beautiful, and the game is flawless. There are no crashes or glitches, and there are also no pop up ads. l typically do not review apps, but Alto's Odyssey is one of the best apps I have played."
"I absolutely love this game. It is well designed and it had beautiful graphics. I have, however, come across the problem that my game crashes about every 4th or 5th time I end my run and try to play again. I would love to see this bug fixed if I am going to continue to play the game :)"
"This is a fantastic game. I really enjoy playing this game in my free time. One complaint- when you pick up a mysterious radio, it is nearly impossible to actually gat all of the crates. You are almost always to early because you are moving toofast. Please fix this by setting the crates down either earlier or farther away. Thank you!"
"Alto's odyssey is a beautifully crafted adventure in which Alto journeys through and endless desert filled with wonder. Glide through dunes, canyons, temples. The light and weather cycles put the game at it's best. You'll never get bored of new characters, or upgrades. The one thing about this game that I dislike is that it is a paid game with ads, but you can always disable internet."
"Very simple game, but perfection for what it is. Very chill. Fairly easy, but challenging enough that a long run is satisfying. Stylish graphics, great sound design, and stellar music. Highly recommended if you need something to unwind after work."
I am not into mobile gaming but this game was really fun. A small but yet very addictive game with great artwork. What helps more is that my phone has HDR so the colors really do pop. The ads are not intrusive and only show up when you want to get another chance rather then to start all over at the beginning.
"Really beautiful game, fantastic art with a lovely soundtrack. Definitely a bit of a steep learning curve to get a hold of the controls but worth it for the gorgeous gameplay. Ads are present but not disruptive and the price to remove is honestly a little cheaper than it should be. Would recommend."
"I love the game. Yes, there are ads, but not too bothersome. The big ads for getting the extra wheel spin or other offered but not required freebies. I just finished the Japan level on Uno quest. I am anxiously waiting for the next one. My only complaint is that we should be able to send and accept all the coins from our friends and to all our friends not just 10. Why have friends if you are not able to help each other with coins."
"I love playing UNO especially online and against my friends. But I wish there wasn't so many problems when I play, its constantly disconnecting and reconnecting to the game and messing up here and there. Again, the game is not allowing me to use my Facebook picture. It would be nice if we were able to talk to our teammate other then the preset comments and different backgrounds, effects and card backs would be great. These are all getting alittle tiring to look at."
"Very fun. I intended to only play with friends, but ended up playing on my own and making new ones! Initially, I was annoyed at how easy it was to lose all your coins, but truthfully, keeping it casual is the way to go and its much less stressful just playing in the minimal multiplier stage since you lose less coins. As for the negative reviews implying the game is ""rigged"", it's not. It's the luck of the draw."
"UNO is a beautifully simplistic game, and this reflects that to a T. A simple interface and card playing system make the game easy to play and functional, and the amazing emotes and playing style variations keep the user coming back for more. As a high schooler, I value the time spent with friends playing this in class. The experience of this game is wonderful, and I would recommend it to all."
"Loads of fun playing solo or in tandem. Play is straightforward; I just can't figure out all of the options, extras, and bonuses! Players would benefit greatly if there were tutorials re the above. For example, I read in the instructions that to play a Wild Card +4 you need to make sure you don't choose the same color as the last card played. However, oftentimes I select a different color than the last card played and I still get penalized 4 cards! Needs tutorials. Hope this helps -- Thanks!"
"Only rating high do this gets viewed. In the last couple months, i had no issues at all. Lately it has stopped responding and forcing me out of the game. I lost every game every time this happened. It took me a long time to get the amount of coins i had and i lose every match because the app shuts down. I have sent a feedback every time but im positive it doesnt even send."
"Can't go wrong with Uno. A suggestion on future updates though. Create a kick feature for the players that enter a game and continually allow their time to expire, and at first go lose a turn. It's very frustrating having to see someone waste time and the computer take over. Players should be able to kick player out game after the ""2nd or 3rd"" time"
"I've been playing this game for over a year now and it's constantly updating. The look, customization options and leveling system are fun. This is definitely for the casual gamer. The only gripe I have is that these losing streaks seem purposeful as a way to push in-game purchasing. Regardless, few game apps keep my attention for this long so they're doing something right."
"I love playing this game because it is very addicting and very similar to the regular card game. I also love how there is different modes that you can choose from. I dont get why people are saying that its rigged and the clock is messed up and picks a random winner. Its actually based on the cards you have which are worth different points so its not picking a random winner, or whoever has the least amount of cards left, its picking the person with the least amount of points from their cards."
I love this game it so fun I love the new update and everything! Two small problems can you add a mode were we can play with no time limit it kinda annoying when people just sit there not doing anything even know they are still playing the game. And can you choose if you want to do challenge because it gets very annoying whenever you didn't want to match cards or whatever. Otherwise It a awesome game! Thank you everyone who helped create this game for us who are bored and have nothing to do!
"This is the first virtual Uno I have ever played and I love how fast paced it is. When I first started playing I wished there was a mode that let us finish the game but I noticed the more you play and on higher stakes the games are a lot faster and usually has an ending and a clear winner. Not much else to say, it's fun, addictive, and a great time filler. Easily one of my favorite mobile games right now. Keep up the good work, Uno!"
Hands down the best and most addicting game ever played on the phone. If you honestly pick up on the way to actually play you will always have coins. I love the fact that theres so much different styles and it never gets bored because you can change what type of game you want. you can play Single or with a friend which is so cool. Good job with this game and i love the little limited edition effects and designs!!!
Excellent graphics and game play. Better than playing live. Would be great if they make a three second time limit per player move. It would speed up play and eliminate players from purposely delaying the game either knowingly or due to their WiFi access. This change would really make playing much more enjoyable.
"Great game...Lots of options! Really enjoying it. Updated on February 24th...still loving the game but two days of experiencing severe glitches in game play in one week is a bit off-putting. And oh, to the powers that be...could you kindly increase the amount of ""likes"" that we are able to dish out in the course of a day...I very often find that I have run out and am not able to compliment a co-player properly. PLEASE fix the glitching issues!!!! Thanks!!!!"
"This latest update seems to be fair. Sometimes in the past you could tell that the algorithm favored others... Seemingly because they spent more money on the game than I had. However, it does seem to be more leveled, as of now. Thank you UNO! for the correction. I absolutely love the game... Only draw back... Is the capabilities of others laughing at others loss. The world is already in a negative place... How about turn off the negative side for a bit and teach others kindness."
I absolutely adore this game and I love being able to play Uno on the go the only negative thing I can think about it is the coins but that also adds an intense factor to it so I understand it. (edit) i hate that there is a time limit. i wish there was a mode with unlimited time like the PC version
"Hi Team ! I have been playing Uno for about 1 year now (basic version) and I am really enjoying it however, with the latest update I downloaded on my device, after I am forced to watched an ad, the sound/music are disappearing and I am unable to restore it back in any way during the same session. Could you please help me with a suggestion on how to solve this bug ? Thanks in advance !"
"love playing this game. I really miss Uno & Friends. Add more friend slots please. Add more slots to the block list please, (I just had to replace someone with someone else on there) should be more spaces please. Add in game protection / plays to buy with coins please."
"First of all I would like the appreciate the developers for such a great game.... Next, I wish that in team up mode there should be a chat option to draw out strategies to win, otherwise, its often confusing with friends to make a possible outcome of a game.... otherwise the game is just appreciable 😊✌️"
I love it What's your different levels when not a bunch but I love it I think you should try out. There's some different levels that you can play with team or no champ and the sounds kind of hard. You get and it's really really really fun like I'm really like it. It's just like calling her
This is a very fun games. There are many modes in which you can choose which one you want to play in. You can play your friends and you can play 2v2. This is the best Uno game I've ever seen. Y'all should definitely download it
"I have nothing to complaint about this game. But i hope you would add feature chat with team, like.. i want to say something to my partner in 2vs2 without our enemies know about it. And i hope you would add ""block feature"" without report, i'm tired playing with stupid people, lost the game coz i found some stupid people. And add some custom chat please, like ""no don't skip, not yet or whatever"""
"It's an awesome game, but it's frustrating when a +2/+4 is played and you have them, but the game gives you two options, which is challenge or pick up"
"Honestly, it's one of the best uno games other than the actual card game. It's good because it has minimal ads and has a 2v2 mode, which is the best in my opinion, and that you can connect to Facebook made it better. I highly recommend playing this version to learn how to play the actual card game."
"Best game I have played ever! Keeps me satisfied playing for a coupleor a few hrs If you like a challenge, this game is for you ! I like to play fast so, this game is perfect for me. It's a 3 minute game and I like to win as quick as possible! You get to add friends, and the coolest thing is you have phrases you can put in the game instead of chatting and cheating, Also I like sum of the deals they have for sale, Look out and see which deal is best, always ! The mostcoins I've had was 64,0000😁"
"This game is so fun and amazing! You get to play against other people or work as a team mate and you get to play with your friends too! I've been playing this game since I was 8 years old, I've been loving this game for a while, and it taught me how to trick other people or do this or that! So if you wanna have a fun time on uno play this game!!!"
"Really like the game, but I thought how the game goes is the loser when playing teams is the team with the most points lost the game. Because if so then I was cheated 5 times on team matches. My team player should have won those games for having less points."
It is a nice and great graphics but there is a problem with selecting cards because when I try to select the correct card then it selects the wrong card otherwise the game is great and beautiful.
"If you do not have enough money to buy uno, play it on mobile it so much fun, but at one point, you can run out of coins, so you need to try and win matches because if you lose a match you can lose coins"
This game is so fun with these players or bots and i just love this game so i can also create a room or join friend's room and new thing in this game is that we can chalange others and if you cant't chalange others(sorry for not spelling it right)and i dont understand why some of these idiots hate it so much and have lots of problems. And thats not there problem thats MINE problem that pepole dont like it. Plz remove hater's posts there so annoying to me!😡😬😠
"The game is too addictive.I played all the day but one problem ,I got bankrupt many times Pls increase the game time to 5min.It makes the game more interesting. Biggest problem too many ads😤😤"
I p personally like this game because it reminds me of gambling games and I love those type of games. I spend most of my time playing this game. I play it more than any other game I could have imagined and for that reason I leave this game five stars. I would love to see more games like this in the future. thank you.
It's a great game but the ads are too annoying.Most of the times I have to totally exit the game and reopen it bcz of the ads.
"Love the game but the issue is that when you loose money you get a button that gives you free money, but you only get a limited amount. So if you need money to play you can't get any. But totally love this game! Thx"
"It's good wholesome fun for all ages. Brings back memories, of playing the card game with my parents and siblings, when I was a youth. Thank you for making what was nostalgic, new, trendy and relevant!"
"This game is really fun.I recommend people to play this game if they don't have the real paper cards or if they are bored. Challenge others, earn coins to unlock levels and earn trophies to unlock the ranked mode.I really appreciated this game since I downloaded it. Hope everyone else enjoys this game like me."
"Hey you guys probably don't hear it enough, but the game is great fun and the new update has taken it to a new level. It runs so smooth and nice, and there is just something generally appealing about how it plays. Keep doing what you guys do! Great work and best wishes!"
"Yall be quiet. There's like 0 adds. Fun, addictive and fair. I have good days on this app and bad days, but either way I keep coming back! Amazing game"
Well I like this game very much and I have played this 1st card game but while playing if you have 2 cards and the opposite players has 3 5 or 4 cards then they will win and i will loose all my money. I have to win because i didn't draw any cards but still I loose and this is making me 😡 angry and you have to make the VIP 's very easy to get as it makes more competitive please please. Besides every other graphics and events are good but please fix the above issues
"Good game, but I can't log back into my main account bc I just got a new phone, and every time I try to log out of the guest, it just keeps putting me back in as another guest. I have the acc on my other device, but its not letting me log in."
To many clock burners which is annoying. You need to fix the clock burners from doing that. That's how they cheat. To bad it's not like the real uno also alot of issues with the downloads of this app not everyone plays your room mode either. I never said to force anyone to lose. I said that you need to stop the clock burners and force the cards to auto play when they do this without them choosing to stop it. Not sure how but it's also annoying some of the emojis are hard to get.
I rate it a 5 because everything is alright no bugs and u can play with friends plus I love uno it's cool u can play with friends and family and its not boring lol
"Honestly, this game is a really good game. I like the fact that you can 2v2 with your friends and join teams. Certainly like the fact that there are many ways to earn money and the constant events really flow with the game. The support menu is really useful and it gets straight to the point and i personally think that the recording option is very useful. One thing that i was confused about is how to get the 'web version' of the game so that i can change my profile photo?"
I love playing Uno with physical cards. I like the specialty sets. This is a great way to play online any time. I'm not fond of the 3 minute timer though.
Amazing game just one problem .................all of the updates they are too much every single day there is an update and the updates take like 2 hours but other than that this game is amazing you can play it with friends and family and any other people.
"It's fun, because you can play with your friends. I am wondering that we can play offline with bots or computer. This will be really helpfull if we can play offline."
With this game had a chat feature such as voice or text during games plus I think adding a chat feature would make the game more enjoyable and sociable
I was very exited when I'm playing and this is also a good experience for me. when we are playing this game it removes stress and give some happiness
How do I add my own picture on my profile in Uno I can't work out how to add one and next question is I was playing a game wild x200 and someone had the letters BK on there profile what does BK stand for. One other thing is it possible to swap items from one account to an other as I've got more that one accounts as I've got some room ID keys I want to give to my main account please help I'm a every day play and love the game lots Thanks uno. I payed to lose the ads and still I get ads
Good game but coins go down even if your win percentage is very high.half the time the coins you win doesn't get added to your coin amount.
It's a very good game where you can play with others but I think you should remove some of the adds which pop up
"I truly love this game. However, I do not know why it doesn t work when I use 4g, as it works only with WIFI, if it is not my phone problem; please fix this issue coz it would lead people to uninstall the app. & Best of luck👍"
"I downloaded this app just 10 minutes ago and I'm already OBESSES!I love uno but this online uno is Amazing!It let's you play anywhere and everywhere,it let's you connect with friends and family but also people online across the world!I absolutely recommend!"
"It's enjoyable! It only has a few ads, tho thy're long, it's worth the wait. I can play anywhere with mobile data available. Expecting more from uno soon."
"When I take time to write a good review, it is because the product has brought me some sort of happiness and delivered as advertised. I enjoy this game alot, really interactive, suspenseful and overall so much fun!!!🧟🙂🙂🙂"
this is such a fun game to play with other people but sometimes it can take a while to load and in wild weekend it takes away so much of my coins if I lose and it's so annoying when so many of my coins are taken away if I worked so hard for them
"UNO is a very fun game ! But it still deducts points every time we play, so it's very difficult to get a lot of coins.. and we can not play for long time"
It a really fun game. With no ads to disturb you. If u like challenging people than this is the game for you. I cant stop play. One game after the other. Try it its really grate and fun.
Love the game. Would like to change my avatar like I see others doing to something other than the presets. Can't find that. Otherwise easy to play and use.
"I love how you could play with your friends, so that's why I rated this 5 stars because you can play with random strangers, bots, or just your friends. This game is very fun."
"The only problem I got is,when you play in the private room with the robot against other friends in the room.when you got the the 0 and 7 to switch between players card.he won't use them,he just draw the card from the deck pile is There any way you can fixed it so he can use them.but that's the only complaints I got.if you can fix it,it be great."
It's a quite nice game . But I woul like to advice the developers of the game to add a feature of voice chat or texting feature. In this way more people will be attracted to this game.😊😊🙂
"I have been playing this UNO for about 3 years, and I love it so much its so much fun and if you lost all your money the next day you will get enough money to play a game and earn more or you can ask for some in your group overall I love thus game soo much🥰🥰"
I love My Uno But like someone said I had a lot of coins and played side by side and lost them all in like three or four games. And side by side it's ok but I don't like that ur partner has to draw
Love this app!!!! I'm just grateful for technology..... cuz I so hated having to pick up 4.or 8 or 12.....and so on.....ntm having to shuffle the UNO deck was a chore in itself....lol!!!! Keep up the great work 👍
"I'd be lost without uno, my most used app 🤣its never failed me or had any issues at all. my whole family has it now and we play against each other its great fun. 10/10 app 👍🏼"
"Guys download it it's the best game like candy crush,or monopoly and ludo so easy🫠🫠🫠🫠🤪🤪🤪but the thing is my rank got down and down ik thats not the reason but I love this game Soo much that Soo fun I wish I win the world cup contests thanks who made the game because now I'm in 3rd rank I can get better my all friends have cards but I can't afford the uno cards thank who made this game....Thanks mattel163"
"I love this game! It's absolutely GREAT! There's not much adds like other games. And it's fun, plus you can win cash! You should absolutely install this game!"
it's awesome but when u lose u have to earn it all back and it's really hard but I don't mind also can you give 10 free gems maybe everytime u log in? That would be nice 🥰
"I've also played Uno in real life and this game is great! I have some experience by playing in real life, but the game here goes even crazier than my games! Keep it up developers!"
I have been playing this games for past few days. I mean I have downloaded this game but whenever I get bored I play this game...I know that playing cards are addicting but this game is not an addiction to me ...it's fun nd good.... really enjoy while playing this game ❤️☺️
It's a very fun game and i love it but sometimes when I want to play it glitch so can you guys fix it pleases
"Here is a request for a new feature: can you allow people to customize their own quick phrases since we can't chat through voice anymore. It would be cool if there was also a whisper option. For example I would like to be able to say to a partner, ""don't skip yet"", ""put nothing down"", ""pick a new card"" e.t.c."
I absolutely love this game! You can play as teammates or just go old-school and play classic! You can even invite friends to play with you! the best part is there is NOT very many adds at all! It is really life-like to the real uno! And it is kid friendly! The best game of uno I have found yet! Definitely 5 stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
love the game i just dont know what to say but one problem there r soooooooo many things only for real money honestly we want free things please comment on this :) :)
"So far so good...most pay to play games make it extremely difficult for the easy level ups if you don't pay to play. I am new to this app but not a rookie to UNO...this takes me back to my youth. The ease of play is great and the graphics are ""cool""! I would definitely recommend this app to others."
My fiancee forced me to download this game and I'm glad she did. This game is so fun! I used to play it all the time as s kid and now it's great to play it on the phone as an adult. 5/5
Love it definitely need to be able to talk with a Mike. There are also alot of lags going on right now.
Very fun! Sometime you get very lucky cards and you get super wins and big wins! I really prefer 2v2!
I have Uno cards in my home but my little brother teer and put it somewhere that I don't know how to find it but when I realised there was a game also like Uno I played it and he was very fun so I don't need Uno cards anymore.
"This game is super fun! Once you get used to how the game works and the basics of the interfaces, it will become very easy to be on the game for many hours lol. My favorite mode is the Go Wild mode. That offers more and quick ways to win and win BIG!"
It was fabulous 🤩 game which I have never played yet my friend have suggested that to me i was so glad 😊 too much I have lots of happiness and fun in this game I hope this information is good to know the importance of the game and what I have enjoyed in this game 🎮 Love UNO
"This is a really fun game, but it would make it better if the uno universe time limit was extended to 4 or 5 minutes. It's nearly impossible to make all of the tasks in just 3 minutes. Other than that, I love the different game modes and being able to play with friends. Thanks!"
This game is super fun and its easy to play i hope they add different battle grounds and new designs for the cards and i hope they add mods that you can try and buy with the game's coins that you earn from playing❤❤❤❤
Its very easy and good it lets you level up easily and it gives you lots of challenges It is a very good game indeed
"Absolutely amzaing game, It's simple and fun and you can play with your friends. 10 out of 10 would recommend (^-^)/"
"Playing Ono is a game that I like to play only because it's very competitive, and to see is the best out of the three opponents you end up going up against."
"It was really fun playing with others. I especially love the ones with tteammates. It's also kind of similar to gambling, which I really love!"
Such a good game like it's a fun classic game on the go for people that gets bored easily and everyone has a fair chance of winning love uno
"Wonderful, time consuming game. Just like real UNO, u feel the competition absolutely love this game."
Me and my mum play uno its so fun but there is one issue whenever I load the game it takes soo long to load but thanks for trying your best to make the game better however its still good tysm sooo much
Great game. No ads and many different types of uno instead of just the one boring classic uno. I highly recommend this game. Especially if you have service with internet access wherever you are.
Less ads would be nice and when you watch one to get coins back or just get coins without having to close the game out and loss them in the Prosse
Great game but it should give you like ten thousand coins a day so you get endless play instead of having to pay to play
Awesome game. So many different versions to play and the Ranked Mode and Tournaments keeps you encouraged to keep playing!!!
It's a very good app to watch adds and it also allows you play UNO in between. Loved it.
Its good for when you want to play a really good card game on your phone with like no glitches or having to buy it on a console or the actual cards so 10/10
I like the game everyone should donload it it's Soo cool you can challenge Players and pay with your friends and win rewards and that's it I hope you enjoy the game.☺️
"the game was awesome, but please help, when I opened this game I was asked to download the latest version, after it was delivered to the google play store, there was no update button. please fix this soon"
It is a wholesome and fun experience to play this simple yet challenging game.
"This game is very fun, but can be buggy. Some of the bugs have been fixed and I hope the rest do as well. The graphics are amazing, I like having to play through levels a few times to make enough money for the next trick, it lets people master the new mechanics in the level as well as let's you improve hand-eye-coordination."
"I loved this game to bits! It had unbelievably smooth animations, intense and complicated levels, and awesome tricks. Each time you die you use the info from the previous run to correct your mistakes so each victory is very satisfying! I've seen a lot of people saying the long jumps are difficult but then I found out that you actually swipe and LET GO. Players end up swiping and holding it which is incorrect. This game will forever hold a place in my heart. No words can describe my love for this"
"Best parkour game out there, realistic, requires skill, keep running dont stop, perfect timing, and has a great storyline. Vector 2 seems to be more challenging and complex but if that's your style that's the way to go, Vector is simple yet effective parkour game that shows you many tricks. The hunter mode puts you as the hunter and you have to try and get the runner while doing flips and collecting cubes. It's more complicated but definitely easy to play, if you love parkourthis is the game way"
I like the game because it runs smoothly the game does not lag or cut off it is also wi-fi free so I can play it any time. I like the controls because they work very good they don't mess up on me so I love the controls. The graphics are very good and nothing is wrong with them I love the technological park. The gameplay is alright because I like the controls because the character vector likes to do parkour and has to get away from a man who shocks him
"I love this game! The parkour is amazing, the animations are stunning! I love how there's someone chasing you as you do all these tricks. The story fits in with the game which makes it even better! Every level is like an adventure, and little bits of the story. Overall a great game! Lookin' forward to installing Vector 2!"
"A unique, stylized runner... Runs can play out differently depending on your timing... lots of variation in the animation- looks fluid... simple, fairly intuitive controls... ad frequency isn't bad, and it's cheap to upgrade out of those... overall an above average mobile game 👍... But bonus stage 1-9 - did you really need to put the cubes in the actual worst spots possible? That took me at least 100 attempts. 😐"
"This was one of my favorite game since 2014 and till this day I still love it. It's challenging, nostalgic, and makes me hype everytime I play this. Some people say it's hard, and it is, but that's what makes it fun It was hard when I first played this but a few months of playing and I've been zoomin' through the levels like it was nothin. I even finished AND perfected all the levels, it was easy, but I'll be honest, I don't recommend this to beginner gamers specially kids, it's complicated."
"It's an amazing game, super fun and a good challenge. One problem is that after you finish them all, you basically are stuck playing this unless you want to spend money to buy the full version. Great experience, though"
Ya I downloaded this game again playing and completing it like 3 to 4 times and I see changes because before changes when we complete one level we have enough money to unlock new stunt and we have to play same level 3 to 4 times to complete and get money for the new trick and bonus is also paid before it was free! ya I like it because the game is not easy to complete now !!
This Is a very challenging gaming although atleast it's good I mean 5 stars good. The tricks is good but I'm sad you have to buy the deluxe version can't you just unlock it after you finish the game. The game gets boring overtime after you finish the game.
"phenomenal animation, fun gameplay, very little ads and a great style. This game is a classic and has everything you want from a simple runner while giving a better experience than the rest. Nekki is a truly great mobile game company with shadow fight 2 also being one of the best mobile games ever."
"I loved this game. I definitely recommend it over Vector 2 because Vector 2 gets too complicated. I love how we don't have limited lives like we do in other games. My only wish is the you guys add checkpoints where we can spawn after dying, and please lower the price of the force blaster, otherwise this game is amazing."
"I love this game and I've played this through out my childhood with enjoyment, great and simple graphics and controls, BUT, there's a glitch in hunter mode 3-5,11. on 5 there's a invisible wall where your supposed to sprint and on 11, I (the hunter) unlocks the code and the door stays closed, while the runner goes through the door, can y'all plz fix this."
"Definitely a fun offline parkour experience. This game is free to play but...... You can speed up your progess alot faster with the expenditure of a few dollars. I personally haven't spent a dime but nevertheless it's a great game, with great graphics. The moves are actually realistic and the storyline is pretty fascinating. This easily earns 5 stars."
Very good game levels very good and I hope you enjoy it and I hope to see it soon hopefully someday I'll have some more handy ideas and I hope to be a good one to help out the team with this project as a part time ho and a few other people to be in touch and see what happens next to your dreams in your dreams when he is only a little more handy than the other words and the session because of some reason for the class and the session to go on and on and on to be sure that the class will try and
"It's a nice game. The character ""vector"" is super parkour man. It's realistic for a game . I Like this and the main idea of the game is cool. But to now I didn't finish the game.......................................................................................................continue...........................................................continue................................................................................................................................T H A N K. Y O U."
"A really Nice Game! It's like running away from My Homework! Anyways I rated this game ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Because There are some weird glitches that are so weird it's funny for me😂 Pls Add some more Locations like The Tower,The forest and Others! Also The ending kinda Cool Not gonna lie! And please make the Hunter killer stuff a bit cheaper like the price is 300 or 350 Whatever Overall,a nice addictive game to play! I highly Recommend others to Play this! 🎮"
"There's no fault to the controls whatsoever, very slick. The artstyle is well done, and the challenge is what makes it more fun. Anyone who says the game is too hard is quite simply wrong, theres no point in a game where you complete every level first time. I personally didnt buy any levels, and my only struggle was the 3rd area, as it should be. Wimpy gamers will say its too hard, get some better reactions."
One of the best games out there. Ads are pretty much optional and non existent. Controls and gameplay are on point. Story is good and it keeps you on your toes. Awesome option of being the hunter as well which adds a new dynamic. Graphics are tidy and actually suit the game. Plenty of new moves to purchase with Virtual coins. And just an overall great experience.
"I love this game! The animations are super clean and the backgrounds look amazing. The game is really challenging which makes it even more rewarding when you find the best route for a certain level. It's not that hard to get 3 stars, however you do need to buy moves with ingame currency to get the 3 stars. But that's not enough of a hasstle to not give it 5 stars!"
"It really is difficult to fault this Masterpiece. Incredibly simplistic in controls, yet challenging. The only fault is the game crashing randomly, but the game is so well made it is hardly noticeable with what the game offers in terms of enjoyment, graphics and challenges. Vector is a very well made game and in the early stages did add a sense of urgency. I am hoping for more agents in Vector 2 (downloaded it today)."
"Really fun, it gets a but difficult to get enough of the coins to buy new skills later on in the game I played this years ago and re-installed it recently and it's really fun and it's nice that you can play offline aswell and there is a nice little intro video showing that there is a story. You can also do more later on like wall jumping, stopping and certain areas and having to take odd routes which makes it more fun 10/10"
"I really liked this game. It's simple in concept, and the controls are easy to get the hang of. The maneuverability is great as there are three different types of jumps, along with sliding, climbing and boosting. The developers have done an amazing job with the graphics, as the in-game art is impeccable. I also love how many different routes you can take in each level, in order to collect bonus points. The ad situation is not perfect, but doesn't take away from the overall game. I Reccomend it."
best challenging game i played.. its pretty much hard to get 3 stars.. but that make it more challenging... and the hunter mode is damn hard.. but i like that too🔥
It's since 4 years I am playing this game l didn't had time to give review but l am giving now It's a outstanding game and l was also happy that it was offline no bugs no glitches and this is my favourite offline game and l like it.
"PARCOUR!! Also, it would be nice to add more controlls, like a backwards movement or a combo of the already existing ones."
"This game is amazing! It kept me entertained, and it wasn't laggy and the distance between time for ad's was amazing! This game is amazing!"
"Excellent game!!! Great work developers. It's simple yet very interesting and engaging. Loved graphics, design, story, modes everything. Keep rocking \m/"
"This is by far the best parkour game I have ever played. Vector 2 is also fun, but I prefer this game because of its simplicity."
"best game if you want to get rid of tiredness & fatigue. Must play game if you want a game with minimal graphics but interesting actions. No bloodshed or anything, so safe for kids. Must try at least once if you love playing games 👍✌️🤟"
i played this game from the past years and i un installed it aswell i love this game but sadly i can't hear some music and sounds i swear my volume are up even the game volume and volime sound affects in settings are up aswell idk whar happened but if you see this comment will you fix this problem it really means a lot and I'll give you 5 stars👍
Love the animations- it really does feel like parkour. The level designs are so creative and the minimalist colour pallet makes it clear what the obstacles are
Wow this game is very good and the physic is so real it was challenging because when I bump into the wall I get caught by the hunter so you just try its very enjoyable playing this game keep the good work keep it up 😄😄:⁠-⁠)
This game is absolutely awesome and the quality and everything was just perfect everyone should try this game. And as far as I can tell this is the bes parkour game you'll ever try
This game playing experience was adventurous . When I play it on my grandmother's phone nd my younger sister phone it was better experience . So I decided to play it on my Own Gaming setup nd tell my friends about this game . My friends didn't believe on this game so I downloaded this game on my friends mobile . They + me experience was good to play this game . Because me + my friends like adventurous games by their childhood . Soo I thank the game developers for develop this game .
This is a very good game of doing some running jumps but sometimes it give us very fast speed that is very good.So all I had to say this game that this game needs some improvement and very nice game.
This game is old. But for the year it was made in it is an amazing. Experience as it progressed over the years it still fits the current year. I would recommend playing it as you can pretty much enjoy it anywhere even offline ( even though some features may not be available while offline) the parkour moves are very realistic except some situations when the moves feel a bit unrealistic but it is a 2D game after all!
"amazing parkour game. i was bad at it at first, but if play the level a few times, you get the hang of it"
"Oh boy. This game is so good and so fun. The animations are amazing, the ads are limited and fair which i think is simply amazing. The graphics are so so simple yet so charming. The controls are good. Could've been better but they don't fill the UI which is nice. And the game itself has some very hard levels or easy levels, which is fine! And of course, The starting cutscene is always welcome. 9.5/10 in my opinion."
This game shows how the man escape the matrix also animations are amazing! Dang all moves are freaking cool!
Actually I rate this perfect cause all of my memories are in this game since 2018 to 2023 iknow it's 5 years ago but this game still a legend and I use to play this with my best friend that's all I love the creater of this game too :)
The game is great it gets harder and sometimes easier when I get more into it definitely glitches sometimes but nothing major just the hunter arrow glitches in front of me sometimes.
I love this game. The animation and controls are amazingly smooth! It is perfect when you just need to kill some time.
"I downloaded this game a few days ago and it is brilliant, the controls are easy to use and it's art is simple but clever,it barely trys to put ads in."
"This game is phenomenal. The detail, the parkour, the gameplay is all phenomenal. I hope someone reads this and enjoys this game. Just give it a try, it's super fun."
"This game is awesome. Apart from the fact that there are a decent amount of ads in this game, I would love to give this game 5 stars. Epic guys! Keep up the good work Nekki!"
"I Love This Game! It's truly unique: ▪ It's reward system (only 3 *'s for a ""perfect"" finish in each stage) ▪ The camera angles that adjust to certain parkour moves u make ▪ Realistic consequences when u wipeout ▪ Simplistic controls with no real violence (u never have to shoot / kill anyone. I would love it if there were more levels...although 20 per Stage x3 is quite high already, we want more of this game exactly as is, not Vector 2 etc or more complications - just continue wit simple parkour"
I have been playing this game ever since I was 8yo and here I am 5 yrs later still playing. This game never failed to entertain and give me a challenge. I hope this game will become a OG game in history and people will still love it. I consider this game over all.
Best parkour game I have played although some of the bonuses are hard to get for example level 6 in downtown.
"Great job at this game 🎮 👏 I only have one problem it's the hunter it's super hard to get the runner 🏃‍♂️ hope you fix it 😀 👍 😉 😄 ho, and lastly please fix vector 2 I can't load into it 😢 😞"
"I love the game. The gameplay IS interesting and I don't think they put ads because ads never pop up on the game and I mean it. I'm not kidding. The parkour is really good but it's a bit annoying when you don't get all the cubes or tricks because then you don't get three stars. You can also turn off the music or the sound effects when you jump, slip, slide and bump into walls. When you press the pause button you can see it at the bottom of the screen. On the whole I'd give give it five stars."
"This game is one of the best mobile game for me, not only cuz I played it years ago it's the intro to that 20 second intro teaches alot about life"
Good animation is good and that is what I have to say is amazing try downloading it and play is amazing is good and I have vector 2 is amazing thank you nekki please don't delete this please :) 🙏
it's a really nice game to play when your bored and it's not that complicated. And I really like playing it I hope you too have fun in this game if you install this game.
Okay the game is awesome I love the Hard contro Isam how is it Hard it is maneuver. But i gotta say that some level felt Like they were easy to get threestors with the way they were aligned. But also I was very disappointed with how the game ended onthefinal level in technology Park. The game shouldn't be ending like astoryThat' when I will give 5stars.
"I laughed when I found out there was NO updates to this ""2023"" version Still a good game though, but wow, that's really an impressively small amount of ""2023"" in this new version:))"
"Best game of parkours. On one hand, the animation and tricks are cool, On the other hand, it's not full version it's demo. You have to pay for the full version. Eneyways, good game."
This is a really good game the story is good and the controls are good the ads are optional and I recommend for everyone to play this game.
"Love this game. It's one of the best games I've ever played the swiftness, sensitivity and all are in place even the storyline is amazing"
"The swipe controls aren't quite as accurate as I would like. I often find myself sliding down when I should be sprinting, or jumping too early or too late. For a game that can require strict timing and execution for perfect runs, it's very annoying."
"Amazing! I absolutely love this, not only did the game create a little video at the start, it also created a well clear and structured game with amazing graphics. This game has really good human body language in running and panting. I know the game has taken a while to create but I will never get bored of this masterpiece. You all should definitely try this!"
"I'd describe this as a ""puzzle parkour"" game if there is such a thing. For a free game on a smartphone, it's actually not that obnoxious with the ads. The only ""ad"" it's pushing is for the premium version, which is cheap and unlocks all of the content you wouldn't get in this free version. The animation and art style looks amazing, it either feels like they motion captured all of the parkour stunts which is going far for a free app."
"Exceptional game!! Others are complaining about the controls and other problems, but I have completed this game and have not encountered any problem. The controls are responsive and the graphics are outstanding. There's even an option to adjust graphics quality for lower model phones. All in all one of the best games I've played."
"In the full version, I think downtown bonus level 2 gave me aids. And downtown bonus level 3 made me want to burn off my pubic hairs with a blowtorch. I had to repeat these same damn levels 800 times in total and I want to throw my phone off of the empire state building. Other than that, THIS IS THE BEST GAME ON THE APP STORE DOWNLOAD IT NOW!!!!!!"
"It's a great game to play offline.. I can find the reason why there's a debug that makes the hunter transport right behind us so that, if we make a minimum mistake, he will catch on sight.."
The Game is very nice but on hunter technology park 5th level has a glitch and that's why I can't complete 5th level please solve this glitch
Nice Game.. but in hunter mode level 3-5 & level 3-11 had a error / bug the game cannot play in that level
"This is one of the greatest games ever made hands down. BUT.. Vector 2 is horrible. It went so left it's not funny, all the great things that set vector one apart from all other games was taken out of Vector 2. I hope the next one runs off of Vector 1 and Vector 2 is chalked up too just an experiment that didn't work out."
"Despite the name, not everything is Vector graphics. Still a nice Chinese game though."
The game is very interesting I enjoy it a lot but when I was already in the one after construction level in vector it got deleted that's why I'm installing and now it's going to take time to finish the levels again. A thing I don't understand why is it called vector i lot the action video played to begin the game. NICE JOB CREATING THIS GAME. I consider it my best GAME after killer bean . I would love to rate this app . And also why does it require money to open another level .BEST GAME EVER..
"Great game! Smooth, fun, decent challenge, good use of a few hours. Neither ads nor paid content forced on you, but don't forget to watch a few ads if you didn't pay for premium, to support the developers ;) Some small issues with the controls, but generally a good experience"
really fun but the hunter always gets me if you can make the hunter a little bit slower I should really like it
"This is a very great game. i first played it long ago and i'm glad i came across it again. but the only thing is that for the hunter stage, the fact that i have to pay to access every location was boring. like 21,500 coins for the Construction yard, and Technology park, and in a game sometimes unless a ruby coin is dropped, you don't even own up to 600 coins. thats my only dissapointment. apart from that the game is extremely perfect"
"This game is dope! I reached the level where you chase after the boy, it was a really sad ending but I only have one complaint, the controls is lacking and very frustrating when I have to do these fancy flips, plz change this control to be easy for people to do it, but I really love this game"
It's a great game to play when you're bored and allows you to feel cool and sick whenever you do tricks.
"This game is great! But it's so easy to miss a box thing.. I really want the meny to update, the menu is so horrible, only a play button, and I think there was a settings button, and there was a store button, and I havnt played this game a long time because I was playing Vector 2"
"It's a really fun game to play when your bored. There are a few problems though, like vector will fall through the floor or go flying in a random direction when being caught, and also sometimes a jump or trick won't register even when I clearly swipe up, but anyways it's a good game."
"I've only played this game for around 30 minutes, and I'm considering buying the full version. This game was a lot more fun than I was expecting. I was expecting it to be like one of those stereotypical running games, but this one just feels a lot more polished, and a hell of a lot more fun. The opening animation was also phenomenal! It reminded me a lot of RWBY. The kinda 3D model animation but it still looks kinda 2D. It's really neat!! Anyways, that's all I've got to say for now. Thanks!"
Its fun but on level 5 and some other stages its impossible possible to get some of the bonuses like on level 5 there's the bonus at the start I've been trying to get it for 20 mins and can't get it no matter how hard i try. Ps it a great game and recommend it to people that like this kind of game.
"I LOVE this game. It's nothing like other games of ""parkour"". When they say it, I will download it. But it brings me to some game that doesn't have real parkour moves. This one, on the other hand, is an actual game with real parkour. I love it's storyline, maps, and moves! Plus, the additional guard mode is very fun. I may not make it at some levels, but it is the best parkour game out there."
"This is like the best parkour game on play store. Five stars for backrounds, parkour and character's animations. I saw that some people is giving hard reviews about the game just by having some ads and having enough stars to pass to another level, just, ads are not necessary but whatever,and if they dont make it to enugh stars, then that's because they suck on the game. Nothing to work in, i think the game is perfect. 👌👍"
This game was great it was made to redo each level with the new information you got from the fail attempt. I feel like they should make a third like this one... Don't play the second it is way worse and the parkor is cool and looks good in the this it sucks in the second I feel like this style is better.
"This is unexpectedly very difficult, lots of retries to complete a level, requires very good skill as the actions are very sensitive, you go to jump but it slides instead due to you unconciously moving your finger down before moving it up, same goes for dashing, it is easy to move downwards while sliding to the right screen, excellent animation for parkour and movement, long jumps require very good timing as you can easily miss if you jump when you are not almost right on the ledge when you jump"
"What a game. Vector is one of my favourite mobile games ever. The simple artstyle of making everything shadow (reminiscent of Shadow Fight 2's artstyle) really makes it stnamd out. The simple control is great too. I didn't beat the game (sadly) but due to the free version didn't Google Play Games support, I had to complete the forst 2 worlds again. Overall, a very fun game."
"It was amazing! It was very fun and challenging! There are a few bugs here and there of the guard teleporting closer to the player, since he goes so far away. It sometimes needed very quick reaction times. I would reccomend everyone to play this game!"
"I have played this game many times before,, and I never get bored of it! I just love how I can play it on my chromebook and use the keyboard instead of having trouble using the cursor. Just a suggestion, maybe you could do a collaboration with crazyjay (a developer of the Stick war game series) and make a game with him, it would be so cool."
"Great game, I haemve played it for a while. And just realized there are bonus levels. There are 6 sections. 3 runner/hunter. 20 levels per sections. 11 normal/9 bonus. The bonus are more difficult and you need very precise jumps for them. The game is very fun try it out"
"So cool, and I just LOVE the tricks and LOVE that depending on your distance of the object, it does a different parkour move, like a Vault, or a long vault! (when you get close enough to a rectangle box to Vault Over it.) I have nothing bad to say about the game! It's perfect."
"I have changed my thought it is much much easier now that I have played this for a while, and just fyi the parkour move get much better later on. Keep up the good work nekki. Now I'm a kid I haven't mastered this game yet I'm still stuck on getting 24 star for the second map please change for all the people how are struggling with this same problem . Also the ""adults "" are struggling with jumping its called swiping up so you can jumping. whoa😁😁😁"
"This is the best parkour game I've seen. It isn't insanely easy, but it isn't too hard to keep playing. As the description says, there are all sorts of tricks inspired by real parkour, and it feels good performing and seeing them. 10/10 game, I'll recommend it to my friends. :)"
"Honestly this is one of if not my favorite games to play on my phone. I find myself being bored and playing the game over and over since its release. I always thought that it would be fun to have another mode in the game where players can create levels and you could play other players maps as well. Maybe an idea for a 3rd game? Anyways one and only complaint I do have for this game is, why did you remove the slow-motion gadget? I really enjoyed using it."
"This game is perfectly animated and is just gorgeous. The levels are each truly unique in there different difficulties. I was awestruck with the different things that happened. My favorite part of this game was the fact that it didn't need wifi, so please play this gorgeous game"
"Everything is very very very good, it's like I'm a kid again, but can you update the game to a bit be more compatible to the newer versions of phones, cuz my new phone when launching this game sometimes crashes, but it is slightly rare to happen. But the game is always fun :)"
"Nice game with nice tricks and flips, the game has good graphics even tho it's a silhouette, the ragdoll animation is funny, map design is very hard to follow but i still like it, the reponse time of the controls are kinda trash(I think im just bad), completed the whole game expect the bonus maps and hunter maps. Pretty good game 5/parkour would reccommend to children for them to cry when they get caught by the guard near the end."
"Love this game sooooooo much I just wish vector 2 could've been like vector 1 In vector 2 there is buying and selling of things and power ups and stuff. I do like games like those but vector 2 had tooooo much of it. And I played Vector (1) cz it was simple and hell fun. In vector 2 it's just a whole lot of work and thinking and managing and stuff. Would've liked if it would've been simple. Just make runs, make cash, buy tricks and move on That's it. Also the hunter mode in Vector isn't that good"
"This has been a really good game and the levels are not that hard or impossible, it depends on your gameplay and I finished all the levels including the hunter mode, I also enjoyed trying out funny attempts while earning money for new tricks and also annoying the hunter lol and the sound when they hit the wall really hard that you will die out of shock but don't forget the power up that will launch the hunter far far away and it's really satisfying and funny so it's a 10/10 lol"
"Great controls not complicated and one of the best parkour games I have played in a while. The story was more than great though I dont really aprove of the ending, but it was still nice want to complete something for once. No ads which was nice to. I 1000% recomened you play this"
The best Parkour game I have ever seen checkpoints are not needed for this kind of game it's fine everything's fine but problem with the money as the level goes higher the tricks costs so much that's no problem but vector 1 was better than 2 nice I would appreciate any kind of game like this from you. Keep it up
The game is VERY GOOD I would pay if I could but the controls to Jump suck on the third level i had to die so many times because it would not jump and it would just Cancel and when also when i was trying to to sprint It would make me Slide if you can fix it Thank you I hope this game makes it to the top😊👌
5 reasons why I gave it 5 stars 1. The story is good and the ending is the best it's like a peak to the next vector game. 2. The stunts are clean as heck. 3. The chase is fire. 4. The hunter mode is hard to finish and I like a challenge levels 5. The abilities are great . Overall this game is the best story and parkour game ever Thank you for making this game
"A very good game! Have been playing it for over 3 years and I love the energy. My only complaint would be that I do get really laggy. Also I would like to be able to have more friends more than the max limit since I meet a lot of amazing people on here. Also, whenever I go to the menu/roblox icon for a bit, it glitches so my joystick seems to control the screen which gets very annoying. If these were fixed my rating would go up to 5 stars. edit: the joystick glitch doesn't really happen anymore"
I saw lots of videos showing that there is a bug on the game. I have been playing Roblox for 5 years now and never experienced problems but now when I join games my screen goes black or turn pink half a year ago I started having problems joining a game what would happen is it would take 3 minutes for the screen to become normal but now I have no problem joining the game. Can you guys also fix a bug that's going on in the game because it's now annoying me? Thank you!
"Fun game plenty of choices for all kind. Also hundreds of other people make the experiences (its a platform game). This game also works better on like PC or xbox. Sometimes on mobile the screen glitches and you won't be able to move it, but if you reset your character and move the screen around it should fix. Overall great game."
"Good game been playing it for a long time do recommend, I do get what people mean with the mobile players yes it glitches sometimes when checking a text but only because you take to long to look at a text if you do the right amount to change a song or something you should be fine. It does glitch as well where you can't move your camera which is also because you clicked on something or you clicked of the game for a bit and you can fit it or leave the game and re join. Also it won't let you go-"
"It's a good game overall, so I'm giving it 5 stars. There are only a few bugs that I encounter, such as the camera bug and others that aren't too annoying since I know how the majority is caused and fixed. However, it's been years since the camera bug started and it still annoys me when I'm PvPing and have to lose the fight because of it. Nonetheless, it's a good game with good creators."
"It's so fun, you can play from a various range of games (Made by people in roblox studio), but there's some major bugs. first off, I randomly disconnect while I have perfectly good wifi and it says internet disconnect, try to reconnect for leave. Second off, I'll sometimes be playing and typing and it doesn't bleep it but when I say it again it bleeps it. But overall, I think that it's an amazing game."
Fun. There are so many games to choose from. You can pick one you might like. Some of them have nothing but you can find another one. There are no ads so 100% add free. Sometimes it is very laggy tho. Sometimes it kicks you out for no reason it is very annoying it say disconnected. It also starts freezing when I play with my friends and also alone. But other than that 10/10 game.
"I love the game and overall there is nothing wrong with it. but sometimes the game itself dosent turn to the side like if u watch a video u turn ur phone to the side. When I turn my phone to the side, in some games it doesn't turn that way and I can't play the game. And sometimes how it just lags but overall it's really fun."
"Roblox is a very immersive game with millions of games to play! You can make friends, play with them, talk to people, and customize your avatar endlessly! The possibilities are seemingly endless. When it wants to work. I have an average internet connection, and it freezes my favorite game a lot. There's the mobile glitch with the un-movable screen, which is very annoying. And even if I dont don't have max friends, I won't recieve a request. Please fix this. When it runs smoothly its amazing."
This is a great great great game! I love it so much! <33 One slight problem mobile players might have are screen bugs that freeze the screen and make it so you can only move your screen in and out. But anthor one that bugs me on mobile is that some games dont work and dont have the right controls for mobile so when I want to play on my phone it will make me play with my phone tilted up. Still and great game though would recommend!!!
"I absolutely love Roblox, but lately the game just seems very slow, it keeps freezing up and disconnecting (even with different wifi networks, some of which can handle Stadia running constantly). I've already checked to make sure that it wasn't the internet or my computer but everything's fine here on my end. I used to play for hours on end but now I cant even sit through 30 minutes because I've been disconnected multiple times and when I do get into a game I'm literally frozen"
"I personally think that Roblox is one of the best games in the history of ever. While there are a few minor negative factors such as the game loading issues (it just refuses to load), and getting kicked from games for no apparent reason, it makes up for all that with it's amazing experiences, the seemingly endless possibilities, and pretty impressive graphics. I certainly believe it is worth taking a look at, it has something for everyone and I can appreciate that in a game."
This game is absolutely AMAZING! You can customize your avatar. Make freinds. And play games! But I wouldn't say it's perfect though. Because recently a lot of online daters showed up. And it's gotten really annoying. And the game can sometimes get really laggy. And certain games will make me leave for no reason. But other than that. It's a fun game!
"I love this app! No adds, online, you can make friends, add your friends irl, and have multiple selections of deferent kinds of game! I totally recommend, and I don't see who wouldn't like it. It's safe for children, unless they start chatting random people and giving personal information, which can be fixed my disabling chats. But overall, great app, and almost all will love it!"
(edit) So far it's still one of my best and favorite games because there's choices and different genres of games. The only problem I've ran into is the lag in some games which doesn't break it but does tend to kick me out or freeze which happens seldom but I would love it if it got fixed and I'm sure others would too. Keeping 5
"I love it! Except for the mobile part where your screen goes wrong and you tried to move the screen, it's either stuck/frozen or zooming in and out. Sometimes, when I hold my hand still (on mobile), it shakes really badly. Same with pc. I keep my mouse still, and it shakes and shakes, and it's getting annoying, so please fix that, Roblox!"
Amazing game and ever since the recent updates my connection has been great and I haven't been getting kicked out near as much. Great improment. Many people on chromebboks say that they have been struuggling with the controls but I have no idea why that happens as I play chromebook all the time. Only downside is there is no shift lock unless it apears on your screen. I think it may be bacause I use my touchscreen so that may be it. Absolutly great game really reccomened it.
"This is game is really cool and amazing! I have been playing for almost 6 years now, there's tons of games to pick! Although there is some bugs in mobile. Sometimes, the camera moves whenever I move. It's pretty annoying for games like 'The Mimic', and sometimes my game just freeze and the screen moves randomly! Also sometimes whenever I want to join a private server, the app just freeze. But honestly it's a great game, and I think you should play it!"
I love this game! I play it all the time with my friends but when it needs an update it never works. I recommend this game as it updates once in a while. And when I'm playing it my screen goes funny like I cant move or my screen moves around when I'm walking or the screen doesn't move. There's a lot of bugs in roblox. But they happen rarely and all u have to do is rejoin the game or reset. I still reccomend trying this game tho.
"It's definitely a good platform for those who love to play lots of games online especially with friends or other random players! The thing that's a bit different is that it might require more data connection (due to the large games files and online players) than other online games, so I don't recommend it if you use very limited data like mine :)"
"I love this game- it's the BEST when it comes to getting online friends! But there's just one problem: the lag. It makes the screen freeze for 5 mins or so and doesn't allow us mobile users to play certain high-level graphics game like doors. If you fix this, I would rather this a solid 5/5. [Edit: okay now I solved it, it's because of graphics levels, 5/5]"
"This is a great game overall, the only problem is, is that its really sucky on a chromebook. I've noticed that when i'm playing on an apple, samsung or google device it works perfectly fine but when i play it on a chromebook it's really slow and laggy. It is a fun game to play with friends in your free time but can be when you try to scroll down to look for a game to play it gliches, even when you are in a game like Adopt Me and you can't scroll through items without a wired or wireless mouse."
"The game is great, only that I know two bugs, the first bug is that sometimes the camera bugs and when you try to move it, it zooms in or out. The second is actually not a bug, please add in the settings to be able to increase the jump button and change the position. And if you can, please try to make Roblox on your phone run smoothly and not lag much. 5 STARS"
"This game is great! So far, I haven't experienced any bugs except for mobile --- a glitch that makes me able to only zoom out and in. It happens when I click on the ""roblox icon"" in-game, which is very annoying considering sometimes I just want to fix my settings. But bugs are pretty much gone, so the experience wouldn't be bad. If it is, then you really just have a horrible device. Other than well, games that lag a lot, such as 100 vs. 100 games.. Other than that, definitely recommend playing!!"
This is such a fun app! there's so many diffrent types of games to discover and u can also change your avatar! but the one small issue is that whenever say that like im joining a random game and sometimes it makes my screen a bit weird and it goes all over the place and that's why I have to rejoin the server but other than that great game! don't get me wrong.
"I just wanted to mention to the other people out there complaining about the camera glitch/bug in mobile. (This is not a complaint about the game whatsoever.) So i've noticed mob users are confused about this, where you screen just freezes. One solution of mine is to open the menu then close it. You don't need to rejoin just to fix a broken view, so your progress on something won't be lost."
"I have played this for three to four years now, and I love it. An amazing simulation game to play. On mobile (iPad) it kicks you out if you don't have the right iOS? But on PC and other mobile phones and devices it works just fine. On mobile you get the occasional kick out and on PC you get the confusing weekly update but it doesn't take too long. Millions of games to choose from, and pretty good for 6 year olds with the chat filter. Amazing game, you should totally try it."
"Overall, the game is just well packed with fun and adventure, and there are absolutely no ads. Just popups waiting for people to add a rating, but that appears at such a rare time. The games are unique, and some can even be better than other Google Play games. I hope to see more varieties of puzzle games or incremental games with a huge map or strategy to explore. It's a decent game with friends, Just make sure to avoid drama around. As I've played this game for years, it's the best. Play it!"
"I love this, it makes me entertained if i'm bored and It has the Best games inside it. It has some problems and technical difficulties though, first is the chat filter, they should change the ""#"" to ""*"" to prevent pranks and only tag out the bad words and dating words. Next up is when the screen gets stuck on loading, it always annoys me because I have to restart the app. Lastly the part when the game freezes. It happens to me when there is a YouTuber in my game and it freezes. I lose the Utuber"
"It's so amazing and I love it so much!💗 I have made lots of friends and played together🥰 although, there's some bugs that are kinda annoys me so much.. 1st:zoom in and out, when I accidently press the side of my screen it zooms in and out suddenly. 2nd: when I lagged my avatar moves by itself... 3rd: when I reset/die I suddenly jump without pressing the jump button... So please fix the bugs and it will make me happy! 🥰 overall this game makes me happy and I love it!! 💗💗 & I love it so much!"
"It's a nice game for people to spend time on. I just like the fact this can be on any device (except for PS5 or Nintendo) to play on! Just one problem. If you're on mobile, you may encounter this bug where the loading screen is just stuck loading which makes us close the app and rejoin again. Please fix this. But overall, it's a very nice game and you may add shaders as an option!"
I love this game my favorite game on it is Brookhaven its a fun game that you can make friends on and rolplay as who ever or whatever you want. And you can play any game even among us but there are a lot of bugs and it's so annoying. But after all it's a good game. And I really recommend it for anyone that wants a game like this but the only problem is that it has a lot of bugs and toxic people but you should still download it.
"I love the games, though sometimes they're annoying. But one thing I'd like to be added is a bigger jump button for phone users, the small button makes it really hard to hit the jump, therefore we die because of something the game has made. But overall I love this app and I really recommend it. Free, fun, and overall, amazing. I love it.good job."
"The game is litterly the best, EXEPT ONE LITTERAL SIN, HOW IS THIS RATED TEEN!? HOW! IT'S MADE FOR KIDS, HOW. (Update : I think I figured out why, it used to be fun in 2019, now, there's slenders, CNPS, Gangsters, and they just make it not fun, Changing rating now, also I figured out how to fix the game glitching where when u drag, it zooms in and out, just open the menu and Close it, and that will maybe fix it.)"
"First off no ads whatsoever the game is a bit laggy on mobile but other than that it's a perfect game for me, so overall it's great! I recommend playing it! And I'm getting some avatar editor glitches like my saved outfits won't load properly so if you could fix it, that would be great! Edit: Not Having That Problem Anymore 😁"
This is an amazing and fun app where many people can make lots of new friends! There are thousands of games to play so boardom is more rare at the point you don't feel it! I noticed the app is also improving a lot especially the avatars and games making some things are improving to the point it looks so realistic I can't tell it apart from real life! The games are also very interesting I would recommend something with a lot of players though but other then that I love it!!
"This is a really great app and I would recommend this for everyone. I only just have a few problems and that is that every time I changed my password and I put my login in and when it comes to the security it always says that the login is getting received by different parts of the country and it's kind of worrying me. And then when it comes to bug fixes, I feel like it doesn't do enough. Can you please get these fixed it would be very appreciated if you do"
"Everyone in the reviews are talking about the camera Glitch on mobile where you can't turn your screen and you can only zoom in and out. I have a suggestion: I'm pretty sure all phones have the triangle, circle and square on the bottom. Press the square then press the app again it might help for apple users just swipe up on the line at the bottom"
This game is super AMAZING.... The games and all avatar stuff is excellent... And also there are many cool avatars that are for free! But when coming to the bug fixes there are some problems which many people and me find it annoying. 1. Whenever I exit it for even 5 seconds it closes the experience. 2. When I die in any game sometimes continuosly my character keeps on jumping... 3. There is also some lagging in some games.... I request the game creators to please have fixed these bug fixes...
"It's fun exploring, you can make new friends, you can also join them on games and you can play tons of different game mods like (horror, action, adventurous and challenging) but i'd rather challenging games are the funnest to me although I do like every type of game but not only does it have one game like most it has a ton of games in one to explore that's just my opinion. But, it's a good game in general and to me robux is good but you should never waist it on things that you can't have forever"
"Overall great game, been playing it since 2018. I did get terminated but it's fine. I enjoy playing roblox and it's going to be awesome over the time. Just fix some major issues like camera movement glitch that mostly occurs when you hold your finger on the screen and go to like menu or flip your camera from horizontal to vertical while your finger is on the screen. (i have found a way to fix the camera movement afterwards, but not everyone knows how to fix it so they have to leave the game.)"
"This is the 2nd best online game I've ever played. I can play with friends or make new friends and chat or do roleplays. I used to play with my best friend breezira but I moved and we don't really talk or playing more. 😔 Roblox is really fun you can do hang out with friends and so much more tycoon, obbys. you can even create your own games and it's it's just fantastic! But there are glitches and I get annoyed by them and sometimes it freezes my whole phone I can't even turn off my phone."
It is a good app you should check out it a game inside of millions of games you could play although it's a good game there's a bit of glitches or I could say bugs. Most of the bugs are on mobile whenever going on private servers and then clicking the join button it sometimes just freezes and the app stops. When playing a experience when I move the screen and then click the roblox menu while moving the screen the screen weirdly moves for an example whenever zooming in & out it zooms the opposite
"AMAZING! This is the best game ever! I always play this game! 5 star for roblox! I've been playing the game since 2017! But there's a problem in mobile sometimes. When your supposed to throw something in a direction, sometimes it goes to the joystick direction instead. Please fix this roblox! And there's a problem where if you tap the menu while walking or using 4 fingers, sometimes your screen moves if you use the joystick or the screen just doesn't work. Please fix this Roblox! THEBESTGAMEEVER"
"Great games of all kinds for all ages. New and classic content with customizable avatars and free to play! Perfect for most kids and adults to play together, but some are also meant for adults only. Not everything always works due to glitches and connection issues like anything else but most games work the way intended if highly reviewed."
"Best app you could ever get! Trust me, you would never get bored. There is millions of different experiences to play. I love the fact that the majority of the games are free but you could buy slightly better games for just a bit of robux (game currency) which is totally optional. Have fun, you won't regret it!!"
"AWESOME. It has a few lags on chromebook, but not all minigames have lag. Ive played this since I was in 2nd grade, now I am in 8th grade. Awesome. Works well on Chromebook model 11 G5. Desirable game. Worthy of downloading. Make sure to play Superhero Tycoon on Roblox also! Includes all DC and Marvel characters."
I love this app I always play for a long time and over all I have no problems right now but would fix the friend limit because I want more friends and the limit is not enough also the car games seem to be bad because they glitch and freeze also I think that you guys should not do the rubux things I want more things to be free like the avator things I want them to be free but over all good app if you have not download it you should good app you can make lots of friends few glitches over all good.
"This game is excellent and my kids play it all the time, although there are a few bugs in game. My daughter always rages because it says that she has ""Poor internet"" even though the internet is fine. Apart from that there is a huge selection of clothing for her in-game avatar even though alot of it costs in real life money. She can also talk to strangers in-game which is usually a good idea. I would recommend this game for your kids"
"It is a good game. I have been playing since when the guest was still a thing. Though I have started to get a bit bored since I've played so many games. It has a wide selection of games to play, but there are some issues. One of these bring their servers and the other bring the limitation of the code they use, preventing certain games to not be as good as they could be. Overall, very fun, especially if you want to try making your own game or stuff"
"Hi/Hola/Salute/Bonjour! This game is probably one of the best experiences for me. To be honest it's so hard for me to play any other game exept Roblox! When I first downloaded this game I thought ""Wow this looks like a great game!"" And I was right! Their is just a couple problems, firstly all these reviews say it lags but it's just your internet. Secondly I want to create things and on the videos it says a button saying start creating will come up on Roblox studio. But it never does!"
"It's been around 5 years I've been playing this game,and it's its-I don't have words to express it.I'm the sort of person who gets board after playing a game for just a few days and this game, this very game-I've been playing for decades,it just keeps getting better and better I've read some reviews saying things about bugs and stuff but honestly this game is a PC or play station game.Play it on them and you'll get the real flavor of the game.I've played most of these 5 years on PC it never lags"
"Fun. But laggy. It's like a whole bunch of games in one. You can customise your avatar and everything. Only one problem. Theres a bug that needs to be fixed immediately. It's where you just cant rotate your screen. It happens randomly, like, you can still walk but you can't tilt your screen. Hoped this review helped! 💗"
"ROBLOX, a game of memories. This game is almost absolutely perfect, from the games, to the features, everything is just perfect. Of course, there are some stuff which need fixed, like lag spikes and other things, but other than that, this game is perfect. Totally would recommend to a friend! 😀"
I love the game you can change your avatar and play hundreds of games within one!but on mobile and tablets(etc.)there is a glitch I randomly happens but your screen freezes then reloads but the camera to rotate your screen only zooms in and out and I think you should fix I but other then that PERFECT game for anyone and once you get use to it and have friends who play it it is 10× more as FUN!:)
"This is a very good game, but there is a problem for the log in thing. The thing is two people can use one account at the same time, but this isn't a big problem cuz neither of the two people can play the games and are just stuck on the home screen (anyone pls let me know if im missing out on something also I experienced this thing idk if this is just a bug)"
"It's.. the most amazing game I have ever played! Me and my brothers and I have been obsessed after playing this game! And every one of the updates is just *speechless. There is so much to explore, so much to play, so much to have fun. There are different types of games for different types of players, whether art, simulators, dating.. and most importantly, events! Other than that, u should limit the robux amounts.. It's too much, and maybe a new update, like tasks to do for robux! Ofc only a bit"
"Omg! I've been playing this game for over 5 years and it's amazing!! Although, in certain games it gets laggy and basically impossible to enjoy. I would absolutely appreciate it if you could fix this. The games are awesome, different types, different styles, it's so fun and social! And i'm glad there's possibility to have friends and play with different people all around the world! Socializing is important and you can get it from this app!! I recommend to try it! It's amazing!! Truly amazing!!!!"
I love this game so much! But the part that I don't like is that it takes up a lot of storage. Other that that it's great!!! It also gets very laggy for me somtimes on sertain games and it lags so much it becomes very hard to try and log off of roblox. <3
"I love this game! It's so much fun, I recommend 100%! What I don't like is in my tablet, I need to use mobile data to play without any lags. I have limited data right now, and I use wifi. My wifi is real good but it just doesn't let me. It always says ""error try again in 3..2..1"". Please fix this problem and I may give it a 5/5!"
"Really great game, have been playing since 2019. There are a lot of games you can play on it, and there are no ads! There are simulator, rp, tycoon, obby, fighting, and more! Again, good game. You can also play with friends. I think I forgot to mention there are multiplayer games, or multiplayer gamemodes in games."
"It's really fun. I just wish there was some way to mute somebody. For example, if someone is spamming the chat, there should be an option where you can mute them. Also, my daughter is 13+ and she wants voicechat but someone set her account age to 2011.. she's tired of safe chat, but it doesn't let her change the date. She also doesn't want to create a new account because of how much money was spent on the current one. If there is a way to fix that please reply!"
An amazing platform it has hundreds of options available to play and you can add people such as friends . In my honest opinion it's rated 7-9 + because there are some scam games to be aware of and always remember not to trust everyone in the game and don't friend random people !! But over-all I absolutely love it 😀 xx
"This game is brilliant! it freezes but there are lots of games. Sometimes the screen doesn't move but isn't frozen.kinda annoying. Tho it's a good game, ROBUX. all of us can't afford. Don't make it free, but please add more & better free stuff. Then we will like it more.Please take this review & will be a better game.👍"
This is the best game ever it's so fun and you can just meet up with friends you can hang out in little worlds or Big world you can make avatars and it's so so fun if you have not played this yet I recommend it the only problem about it is it can get glitchy from time to time but it's usually even just the smallest glitches like sometimes you screen freezes for a second but it's hard to notice and if you do notice it will fix right away
"Great game! Awesome that u can customize your avatar, make friends, and create your own game! Although there are a few problems. There are online daters, hackers, and exploters that ruin the experience of the game. Other than that its 👍👍"
"This is the best game ever,I like it! When I was 5 or 7 years old,I played the first game. “Easy Obby”. I like it but my parents won't let me play it again. So,when I was 9 years old,I downloaded back and I having so much fun. I like it's control and design. But,It's seen it has a bug as well,if you suddenly scroll out the screen and quickly join back,your camera will be broken for while.But,I know how to fix it now.Just press the Roblox logo on top left screen and your done. I love ROBLOX!!!!!!"
"I LOVE ROBLOX! It's a great game to download. There are NO ads. That's why I gave it 5 stars! If there where more stars I would rate all the stars. Also, sometimes the game can be REALLY slow. I love the game SOOOO much!💛 But another thing, people can be really inappropriate. But i love the game."
"Well i do see people complain about the lags,glitch,etc. and i kinda agree with that,but OVERALL it's sorta best for me ig cause there are tons of games to play with in just one game, u can play with your friends,dress up ur character,and explore! For ME,i don't really have a problem with Roblox tbh. So with that,why don't you come and play with us viewer!"
This game is really good and fun for all ages to 6-15. It can be very laggy and has a lot of updates. However it is a good game and fun to play with your friends especially with voice chat. It has different varieties with the games and has all kinds of random games that can be fun. I would personally recommend to update less/ do bigger updates at once. It is a very fun game and I would definitely recommend it! Please read this if you have the time
very nice it's very good to play I love this app so much! but the thing is that it keeps disconnecting even though my wifi is strong but I hope you can fix it! :) and.. I'm on a Chromebook others says it crashes when you play on Chromebook but mine is just fine no lagging accept disconnecting you will find it on (1 stars) they said it's crashes even mine is just very great! that's also weird though but that's for all..
I've been playing it for pretty long and I have some favorite games already so I honestly think it's a pretty good game and no ADS that is the most greatest part there's no ads messing up your experience and that is perfect it's sometimes Laggy for iPad players I prefer phones that's what I've been playing on like the whole years plus this is such a perfect game that it's a 5/5
"The best games ever , i pretty much like everything, but the one i like most is Islands. Really good game and certainly alot to do in it. I would like if the owners can fix the despawning of items from the conveyer belts. But apart from that all is fine. Thank you"
Amazing I love this game literally if there is a billion games to explore that means billion players! I didint know a game can handle that which I don't know how a game process actually but there are some lags that make my tablet keyboard disappear while I type. Maybe it's not lag but computer feels more good also I'm having trouble with some games when after like 15 minutes I get my tablet crashed but I hope that bug gets fixed
"I like this app so much! Let's say jts my fav game. The reason: I always lagged but it got fixed, there was the mobile shiftlock glitch. It got fixed! But one of the shiftlock glitch is there, which means that when I sometimes go to a tower (the bug is only on mobile) then the shiftlock works but when I put it off again i still have shiftlock on. (Sorry if this doesn't make sense or if u didn't understand, I'm dutch)"
"U love this game so much and I play it every single day because I met amazing people here and had fun playing different games with my friends. It would be better if it could be like Instagram and when you send messages you can unsend them and you can see when a person veiwed it and who viewed it and what time they seen it. (Idk it would be useful to see who's ignoring you ig?) And if we didn't have to have limited friends, that's not fair to have limited friends bc there is just so much ppl here"
"Ok roblox I'd HIGHLY recommend to install, because there's a variety of diff games, and kid friendly, ect! One small problem, though on mobile (unless your device is great quality) it tends to lag, actually so much that the whole APP restarts!, in fact I had to get rid of my old tablet just so I can play games I like without problem! But other than that HIGHLY recommended!"
"Amazing game! Literally if your bored say goodbye to that feeling, because all you gotta do is get in and there's so much to do. you could be a pvp player and there's tons of that, but if you don't like those kinds of games and prefer playable story's, they have that, too! There are even educational games! Oh, and I could never forget the nextbox games! The only problem I've ever had is easy to fix (with my new knowledge of Android XD). Therefore, 5/5⭐"
"Super fun been playing for years! If want want to be more social with other people this is the game. I have always liked the fact that you can make new friends of all ages! It's great for kids to have more social life out of school, I really do think more kids should play. Not because it's something to keep them occupied but it connects real friendships by heart. Not someone to just play with. I'm not saying this is like a dating app but friend version, you play millions of games to connect."
This is a really good game I give it five stars because it's really good that's good to make friends with but at the same time sometimes there's a glitches and sometimes I can't move my screen and sometimes it makes me lose games after all that take away that it's awesome you should go check it out you can talk to friends make friends and most of all don't like the game you have to pay for its bloxburg 😁😁😁😁 he's one more thing the fun fact is that is free.
"I love to play with my friends on this platform,genuinely a fun game to play, but sometimes you get get a bit bored from it, and the players you meet there are so funny,wholesome, etc. Just a bit of glitches and hackers is the bad part, but other than that, one of if not my favourite games ever. I hope you have fun playing it too:)"
"It's an app with a lot of interesting games inside. Really good and excellent as long as you play it fair. Kinda need parental guidance for kids because some people are toxic who says lots of bad things and some games are inappropriate (kinda 🤔). And as a player of roblox, it's worth it because there are different kinds of games to choose and you could interact with other people. So all in all, it's a hundred of a hundred 💕."
"I LOVE IT, honestly, no ads, no lagging for iPads! There's more than a million games to play with friends, it's just, amazing, however SOMETIMES it lags on mobile, but, there's so much to do, that's why I rate it 5 stars."
"It has a lot of fun games and cute outfits. It can be VERY addictive. I remember a few years ago I got addicted with adopt me, don't judge I was young! 🤭 But as I said so fun and I love love love the avatars. Such great games but I wish people would be more appropriate in the chat because I know there is younger players in the games most of the time. Less online daters and inappropriate players would be the dream. But I get that the drama is what makes a lot of boring games interesting. ❤"
"Wow! This is the best game I ever played in my life, It's super fun to play and there are many games to play in it. We can get friends in it by inviting and requesting, But we should use real money to buy robux but we can get cool items in special events.. I hope this is helpful bye!!"
"Literally the BEST game I have ever played!!! I love how you can customize your avatar, make friends and play whichever games you want!! Some of my in real life friends play roblox and it is so fun to play with them!!! But I just have one little problem. In certain games it gets really REALLY laggy and then it kicks me out for no reason. Then after it kicks me out I have to exit roblox and go back in. I don't know if it's the games but it is definitely not my device. Pls fix!"
"I love it and have played it since i was 4 and im almost in middle school now. my only probem is that something seems to be missing. What we need is notifications. Like for when someone sends you a message, invites you to a game, or if your robux is done pending. Other than that, i love the game just how it is. But i would love it if you added notifications<3"
It has many options of games inside of a game and it's really nice it's very adventurous and i absolute adore the avatar's and everything.the fact that u can also play other dress up games like meepcity where even if u have no robux u can design the character of your chose and that what's make it amazing! So I'm giving it a 5
"This game overall is good. It has a variety of games. It does stop working some days and sometimes it's slow. But it is a nice game where you can both play and customize your avatar. The only thing is that not a lot of people play and it can be hard to make and trust friends, so it gets boring sometimes, but that isn't Roblox's fault, so overall it's 5 stars for me. Sometimes they might take away some items that are in your avatar/that you bought, because they are not available,they will refund"
THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER I PLAY THIS THE MOST!!!!!!! But I have a few ideas to make it even better. 1. People like to send pictures and I would like to to so could you make it where we can send pictures? 2. Can you make it offline I love playing this but so times i have to go so where and I can play games on the way but not roblox because it's offline and not everyone has a car with internet. I will give another review if I have more ideas. Please find this helpful!
I love this game it's silly it's serious and it's fun you just need to get rid of that screen glitch. It either freezes your screen or it makes it so when you swipe in a direction it goes the opposite direction on the screen please fix this. But the reasonable reasons 5/5 :)
"Roblox is amazing i have been playing for over 3 years now on chromebook and phone when i downloaded the app on chromebook it takes a while to download but i woulnt recommend using a mouse because a mouse would be more like a pc and if it dosent come with a mouse dont get one unless you know how to use if you do get one get the one with the chip where you plug it in from the side but overall on phone,xbox,chromebook its amazing!"
"There are lots of different games, mems, and lots more. Want I don't really like in this game is that there is a bunch of lag. But after all it's great. There are many games which are not suitable for children but some children play theses types of games. I would recommend children 8+ should play. And the idea of buying ""robux"" is good as you just can play this game called pls donate so you really don't have to buy robux."
i love roblox it is my favorite game to play but i wish there would be a few changes if you can make the upgrading optional so people like me who have problems with the play store app sometimes dont have to so we can play it but i understand to upgrade it gives you new things and your not held back but anyway i highly recomend this game! (if you have wifi ofc) :)
I've been playing roblox since 2016 and there's actually nothing wrong with it except the mobile screen problems and the actual Roblox community. I recommend this game because you can make tons of friends and you can play many games as you want you can also play this with your friends (if you have one lol) this is also one of the best games I'm playing through years
This is the best game I have ever seen . It's amazing !!!!!! You can play with your friends or play by them self's the game can teach you stuff there is one where you can build a house but you have to pay bills and get money from working. If you log in everyday you get rewards ! That is just one game Roblox has got a bunch of different game and there is over a thousand ! so ya I definitely recommend it byee!
"Best game ive played for sure. Buttttttt.. robux prices is the problem here. Vampire face costed something around.. 75$ but changed to like 52,000$ something like that! But other then that the game is good. This game is well outstanding. Hopefully u change the prices of some items. Oh and those crowns accessories are just hard to get, especially the HIGHEST crown to get. And tbh that crown is one of the worst ones (highest amount of plays playing ur game) 👑 but the game is really fun. BYE C: ."
"There are many awesome games and overall it's fantastic. But If you make any friends, I recommend not leaving them. If you have watched the anime ""One Piece"" then Blox fruits is the best game. I dint recommend brookhaven as there are many online daters. But old brookhaven Aka/ Prime brookhaven was something else 😔 😟 🙁 😥 I miss it."
"The game play is very cool and nice, but the one reason it's 4 stars is because there is a zoom in, zoom out problem that is already common for mobile players the zoom in, zoom out problem is when sometimes you try to swipe around to look around but it would only zoom in, zoom out. These are major problems for me as a mobile player and as one of your players I hope that you will fix this."
"I really love roblox. But a few things the creators can work on is not being able to get disconnected. I hate whenever im playing a game with my friends and get disconnected. For example when im in toh (tower of hell) I will be on last level and get disconnected. Another thing is when im in toh, someone friend requests me, i hit accept instead of hitting the jump button. Maybe make the friend request like a banner? I think it would help a lot of players. Other than that I love roblox. Thanks."
"I've been playing this game consistently for the last several weeks and I'm extremely pleased and impressed. Excellent game, great for passing time, and a good challenge in micromanaging resources. Kudos for not implementing annoying ads in a free game. Cute attractive graphics. The game does have some glitches here and there but nothing major and being a developer myself I can appreciate that bugs do exist in software, and we as use must be patient until they are fixed. Keep up the good work."
I enjoy playing this game. One of the things I think should be changed is how long it takes you to get in the building supplies to build a few zoos build the buildings. I have so many zoo animals that need enclosures. That I can't get because I am not getting enough building materials. I am unable to receive anymore animal cards. If you guys would please change that for everyone that plays. Other than that I really do love playing the game
"I've been playing nearly 4 yrs. I love the game overall but I wish some things would get fixed. 1st - when building the buildings, it takes forever to get ALL the tools you need to complete the building. 2nd - the mini games have levels that are impossible to beat w/o having the extra explosives/boosters. If u don't have Tcash to spend then you're stuck on that level & can't beat the daily task or gold ticket task. Or spend ""real world"" cash. 3rd - it takes forever to get enough xp to level up."
"Favorite game of this style. Amazing flexibility and design control. Awesome way to connect in co-ops with people all over the world. Awesome competitive game if you're looking for something to add to the creative side of it. Very interactive with constant ways to keep you interested, and using your town to the highest capacity. The updates are regular and always getting better. Could not recommend a more thorough game. Can be entirely free, but obvious money options are at your disposal if you choose to go that route. Happy gaming, from an enthusiast about this one."
"Great graphics and gameplay, but it sizzles off after a while. The real-time wait to make things increases until eventually you can only do a few things when you log in each time. I'm a binge player. I like to do a bunch of stuff at my leisure, not collect a few things and log back in a few hours later for the next step, just to log back in a few hours later for the next step, repeat, repeat. Basically I've been playing for a few weeks and it's lost excitement. There's no challenge. Just waiting."
"I was supposed to play the tutorial to get coins on the lucky day app...but then I got to level 20 in 4 days! lol its surprisingly addicting, simple, fun, and keeps my mind busy for a bit. This game requires you to walk away and let things happen until you're caught up. Reminds me of farmville only way better! I love the ""ask for help"" feature it really helps fulfill orders, and visiting other towns to give gifts to them and see different design concepts for their city is also a nice touch. Just try the tutorial and see what happens"
"I love this game. You dont have to use real $$ and you are never stuck on a level. However, I wish the developers would allow us more supplies to finish things so we can grow. I know that is how we are slowed but many of us have many buildings unfinished. It is annoying. The colors and graphics are fabulous. I use mobile all the time and have never had an issue. This is a great game!"
"Love the game but wish you could have a choice on getting zoo orders faster, instead of waiting for them. Its hard to do the regatta race when you choose that task. Also if there was a way to see what items you need to fill orders by clicking on the item, instead of just clicking on each order and then going to make it and then finding out you need to make more."
"I can't get enough of Township!!! I'm so addicted to this game that I can't go a day without playing it!! I'm so into this game that I I've actually lost track of time and ended up playing this game for almost 14 straight hrs!! My back was pretty sore. The next day haha!! Anyway, what a fantastic game, teaching young players about supply and demand! I really hope they add onto this game though. I think that after you do all you can do in the game, after you complete and have upgraded to the last level you can complete, they should have another type of scenery. For example, this scenery was placed in the mountains. So maybe the next one could be like the desert or like an Alaskan terrain, something like that, if that makes any sense. So the desert would have like a Vegas feel to it and the Alaskan terrain would just be snow covered hills and woods etc. where you would have to keep plowing because of the snow fall and build your own airport landing strip etc.. I think a lot of people would agree that they would love this game to carry on after you have completed everything you can possibly complete in this AWESOME, ADDICTIVE GAME!! I ❤️ TOWNSHIP!!"
"Love this game!!!! Super easy and fun to play! It was a little slow at the beginning when I was just starting to build my town but picked up pace very quickly. I love that it allows me to design and be creative with my towns set-up, so many options for decorating and I can change things around whenever I want to. It takes me a bit to get used to each update change but I love all the new stuff that's been added. Great job Township!"
The game is easy to pickup. The graphics are amazingly real. Everything seems very true to life; stress and deadlines included. Lots of logic and problem solving while you build/layout the town the way you like. The regattas and other competitive events are simple yet fun and challenging. You also get to interact with people around the world and get an opportunity to learn another language or two.
"I really enjoy this game! The are only 2 things I wish would change. First, is some sort of helicopter upgrade that would gradually decrease the time between deliveries or decrease the time to a new delivery if you dump one. Second, is a mass edit mode so we could completely rearrange our towns as the grow! This one is the one I'd most like to see. That was one of my favorite tools in Forge of Empires."
I love this game! There is so much to do. My only suggestions/complaints are: 1) there should be another way to transfer progress other than linking the game to Facebook. I don't have Facebook and spend to much time not be able to transfer my game progress. 2) it would be nice if in factories you could delete/replace what you have in que. 3) it would be great if items rotated 360 instead of just 2 ways and if you could view the game from different angles instead of just the one way. Thank you
"I love this game. I have been playing for over 3 years. It is so fun. You have to manage crops/animals/ingredients/factories/products... etc. The graphics are awesome and there are holiday themed decor. I LOVE designing my town. You can choose where everything goes and buy decorations with in game currency. There are events to earn in game products/currency and helps keep it from being repetative. I spend real $ now and then because I want to, not because I need to. I really enjoy it!"
Edit: I've gotten to the point i dont want to play anymore because it is taking too long to build anything. 😒 This is my favorite game! I LOVE the graphics and the bonus games and events. My only issue is the longer you play the longer it takes to get building supplies. I wish we would get them in more chests and from filling zoo orders or ships.
"Cute game, only thing I dont like is when you put something in the factory to get made but by accident you pick the wrong one or for some reason it picks a different item you dont have a ""CANCEL"" BUTTON To cancel the order as well as when you plant in the field. Also, it would be nice to have the ability to communicate with your friends on your list to help them out or them help you out. I would also reccomend giving the option to add people as friends whether they are in the same team or not"
"it's kind of challenging getting started but it's fun. still having fun a month later! Almost 4 months and it is still fun. Solo challenges and team challenges. It's great. Over a year and a half and it is still fun. Still fun. I do the best I can without spending rl$. I wish there were two townships: one for players who use time instead of rl$ and one for those who spend rl$ instead of time. Two years, still having fun"
"This game is very laid back, easy to learn. I just wish there was easier ways to earn cash to build up the zoo, earing all those supplies is trying but I play whenever I feel like it so I guess that's why it's harder to get the supplies, but it still takes too long to gather bricks, hammers, nails ect. Overall I love the graphics and animal sounds when to tend to them. It deserves 5 stars. :-)"
"Great game! I would like more 'match two' games, levels and prizes to create more 'rooms'. I would like the rewards for sending off planes to correspond to the speed of sending off planes, i.e.: greater prizes for faster service. I would like to reduce the time it takes to grow plants, create items, etc. I leave the game and come back later because it takes 3, 4, 5, even 14 or 15 hours to get anything done! That's too long to wait."
"Absolutely love this game! It's so much fun! Love the updates at different holidays. Love the co-OP and meeting and conversing with new people. The only complaint is, it takes to long to finish building and to expand. The puzzle decorations ask way to much to build and the zoo enclosures are ridiculous to finish. Other then that, I really love the game."
"This game is disgustingly addicting. Not only that but it completely allows you to play without paying a cent. Caveat, I did spend .99 after a week or so playing. It's basically a resource management game with a farming facade. What it does it does well. The pace of levels and content are a good. There is competition when you level, and if you do like spending money it does give you an advantage to level up faster. Number one complaint is that you cannot rotate. I am a perfectionist when it comes to my city layout which is why I enjoy this game."
"I Loooove this game! It doesnt get better than this from graphics to totally free play. After over two years of playing I've never spent a dime. Plenty of game cash is provided through a variety of objectives even though it's not even necessary for advancement. Everything is extra cute too, from animals and trees to decorations and buildings. So many customization options to build a town that's totally personalized. Oh...and no intrusive commercials at all, perfect!!"
It's a lot of fun when it works but it does seem to have glitches especially up every time you're forced to update. In terms of the Regatta it often crashes and you have to reboot and redo several times before you get credit for the tasks you finished I hope you guys get these bugs fixed soon! UPDATE: Seems these bugs are fixed! Yay! Thanx Playrix!!
"This game is amazing and hooks you. Highly recommend. I started June '19 and haven't missed a day since. I quit a game I played for 4 yrs so I could give this my time. It's awesome to build & change your town and get special decor from mini games etc. Many good co-ops. Don't settle. People complain ""takes too long to get materials"" but I disagree. The game is about the journey, not the destination. If you build everything fast, then what?? Nah. Each milestone feels rewarding. Give it a try!!"
"I love this game. I have been playing it for a couple years now. You don't have to ever spend real money on it (unless you want) and you can earn game cash frequently from rewards and can watch ads to earn too but that is completely optional. I love the complexity of growing crops, making products in factories, shipping via helicopter, train, or plane and all the contests and games. Its very addicting."
"Fun game! you build your town and grow it, setting it up and changing things around as you want. crops, livestock, products, challenges, shipments, construction,...lots of tasks to do. i think its also nice that players can help each other. some things take more time to develop than i'd prefer, but still fun. NEW EDIT(Jan 2020) I've been playing for over a year now, there are a few parts of the game that need to be changed to make it better. Like the regatta and the tool store."
"Just like your other games, the photos for describing the game are misleading. However, still like your other games, it's better than the pictures say. At first I was disappointed that the photos were misleading, but after trying out the game I fell in love with it. It is a simulation game where you are the mayor of a town and try to keep it going by making food in factories and opening gaming stores, etc. It's addicting and a good time killer."
"Hooked after 5 minutes, no puzzles, fun mini games, great community feel, fun themes, updates have all been good. Hard part is keeping patience. Its easy to get lost in there. Not to easy or to hard to advance/level up at first. Good in-game reward systems. The only game that I haven't grown tired of yet. The advertisement that got me to try it is completely inaccurate when it comes to actual game play, Not even a mini game like it. Would like to see that. Slows down at level 50, moreso at 60..."
"Fun, entertaining passtime. Does not require too much time or attention to maintain. Update: It has gotten to a point where it requires too many req. items to build a zoo enclosure or build new town bldg etc. Those items are too seldomly acquired and take too much space in the barn. Has become annoying, this. I understand that is to encourage you to spend more actual money but may end up driving away people."
"No issues. No Pressure to spend money. Very addictive game. I've only been playing 5 or 6 days, and am Already at level 26, I Think (maybe 25) it's nice to be able to let it go for a day, and, Although you may miss a ""special"" it isn't as irritating as, losing crops,people, items. 1 Criticism. No explanation of expiring ""coupons"" was disappointing... that is one feature that I would like to see change. And, getting expansion materials, Could be a Little less repetitive and more helpful."
"Love it! So fun and relaxing. Always something to do or participate in the game. The 0nly criticism is the tools needed to complete building in the town. Almost impossible. Wish they'd go back to regular materials or tools could be earned on trains or prizes,gift boxes,etc. Update: the Professor's game is so much harder to get the items to get rewards. Ridiculous amount of items to acquire! I have always collected all rewards but this time I really doubt it! And we pay real money!!!!"
"I really enjoy this game! It helps me with my anxiety a lot! I wish there was a button to cancel the production of goods after you put it on the conveyer belt at the factory. For example, sometimes I accidentally put cow food into production when I meant to put chicken feed and then I have to wait until the cow food is done to get what I actually needed. Wasted time and materials! No big deal, just a thought!"
"So far I find the game interesting and fun, the only thing I don't like is how unrealisticly long it takes some of the items to finish in the factories. So after playing this game for almost 3 years it's becoming frustrating with multiple events going on and a short period to complete them, not all players have team members to help complete assignments. And can you please stop all the pop ups as soon as you enter the game? Thank you!"
"Not Spons. Love this game. Everything about it. Rarely an add. Great layout. Easy to use. Sometimes you need patience if you don't wanna buy a few farm dollars. But there's always something to do during the wait. And last but not least, if you're competitive like me, there are constantly new challenges with awesome rewards. Will keep playing. Need to unlock all levels."
"Well thought out city and trade game, can self pace as you want, or can compete in events. Events are sometimes linked to mini games which can be fun, but when hand eye coordination is needed can also be frustrating if you accidentally touch the screen or cannot get timing right. Goals are explained very well and tracking of achievements and other rewards run smoothly. Overall a very nice addition to the genre."
"I love this game! It's challenging, sure, but that is part of the fun. The graphics are phenomenal and I love discovering what the different characters in the town can do. I also appreciate the seasonal changes to the town. For those that say you can't make progress without spending real money, I have had two different towns over the years. The first was on level 82 before my tablet crashed and I had not spent a dime. I am currently on level 90 on my second town and have spent $1.99"
"I love Township, its aesthetic, control systems, quests, fancy items, and the co-op system. Between that and the City Market, I find that even though filling some orders can be a challenge, I have help, and I only have to spend real money if I get impatient. The only thing I lack is to be able to build out into the water. I want to fill my bay with boats and get that castle island!"
"Fun game, entertaining, cute graphics. I love that they change the game for each season. The only two cons for me would be the mini games. There are to many and to frequent. It's not really optional to play them when there are pop ups and when the daily gifts you send and receive from your friends are related to the mini games. The other would be they made it more difficult to get building material for buildings, the zoo and the barns which makes game play a bit frustrating sometimes."
I enjoy this game immensely. There are a couple of things I would like to see occur but there's been some real nice improvements. Biggest thing needed is a separate storage for tools vs marketable items. And a button to take us to the zoo entrance. Lately it's crashing whenever I try to pick the friends button and sometimes when I pick the communication with team button.
"THE ADS YOU SEE ARE NOT THE ACTUAL GAME. The ads where you need to clear the path for the person to get through or where you are doing a puzzle - are not the game. I don't understand why the game is doing it. The game is actually really great. It's very fun and I would highly recommend it if you like simulators, especially one that involves a town lol It does take time to get the resources but it's not pay-to-play. You can get really far without ever buying anything."
"Addictive 😀😅. This is an amazing game, before you get to the exciting stuff you have to level up with xp by doing stuff like harvesting collecting filling orders at either zoo orders, plane cargo's, or train. You can do many other things to get xp, but there is also co-ops which are little groups that help you and which you can communicate with, and there is just too much to explain, but download now! It may not be like the ad but it is way much better. ( Well in my opinion)."
"I've been playing this for almost 2 years now, and I haven't gotten bored. Easy to play, and a good way to exercise the mind. Town planning, budgeting, goals, making/using raw materials to make other items, but it's still fun. Visit neighbors, start a co-op, weekly regattas, challenges both regular (check inside your town hall) and timed events (rotating throughout the year), plus a mine, heli-pad, a plane, ships and trains. Play by yourself or convince your friends to create a town too. Enjoy!"
"Very diverse and interesting game, doesn't get boring. it is slow moving in a good way. not meant to play and be done with specific levels but u unlock things and gain more space, more items so u can do more the more you get done. it is a patience game with pretty much always something to do and things to check on. i love being able to put the game down especially if im waiting on things, do things in real life come back to check on my town and have things to do. i personally love this game💕"
"I definitley give this 5 stars! The ads that you see where there is puzzle solving as well as the candy crush saga bit IS. NOT. FAKE! I just got to the first puzzle level in the game and its just like the ad. If you are skeptical thinking that this game isnt about puzzles and match em' up games, then you are right it isnt. But it does include them in the game. There isnt too many ads, but it does take a while for certain supplies to come in. I totally recommend this game!"
10/26/20 I was able to participate again. It appears whatever was wrong has been fixed. I like the game enough that I kept waiting for the repair. 10/19/20 Update I enjoyed this game until the last update. I continually get kicked out of the game and am no longer able to participate in the regatta (team) competition. Creating your own town is fun. The graphics are great. I look forward to the holiday changes. Working with a team makes all the difference and keeps me in interested.
"Good. Makes the time fly by and I like that. Helps take my mind off other things. Some of the challenges I believe are hard to accomplish but then again, they wouldn't put them on there if they wasnt tangible. I also like the face that others can help you with the upbuilding of your town. Certain ingredients or even dishes that you cannot create at the time. In conclusion, I have and will continue to recommend this game and the other collaborating games to my friends and family, thank you much!!"
"I still like Township very much still. It's very challenging and stimulating at least for me. I allows me to build, strategize how to build a town/city the way it would imagine it. At the moment the only difficulty is trying to expand my barn. Even selling goods and supplies took an effort especially trying to finish events. Still I stand by my thoughts."
"Started a day ago. So far it's lively and engaging. Simple interface, easy to pick up and play, or pick back up where you left off earlier. Bonuses, add-ons, and expansions unlock as you progress. Adding friends let's you view their town for comparison and ideas for your own town layout. Rated: Fun"
"Absolutely enjoyable, yet very time consuming with all the different factors. Running most aspects of your city as the ""Mayor"". This in itself is a multi tasks game. There is so much to do, all in 1 place. I love it! *It definitely needs a few more icons along the bottom (for more shortcuts) to certain highly active or highly used places, such as a boat docks button, a marketplace button, and a mine button. . that would be awesome and it would help immensely in navigating easily through the town!"
"Very enjoyable. I've always enjoyed miniatures, since I was a child. This game is that and more. It is creative and satisfying, and you feel like you have accomplished something in the designing and ""building"" of a town. What you have loved and imagined becomes real, to a certain degree. Love the holiday changes, the great animated graphics. Simply a very fun downtime activity. Well done!"
"Such a FUN game! Very easy to set up your town the way you want it to be laid out. You level up pretty fast and the cost to purchase things, such as buildings, extra land, roads, decorations, etc. is very reasonable. That way you don't run out of game money and don't feel forced to use real money to make in app purchases. I only wish that the farm animals ate faster! 😁"
Love this app. Game play is great and graphics are steller. If i had a complaint it would be that it is super hard to earn enough coins to get diffrent bulidings when they become available for your level. For instance im level 60something and i still have yet to get a building for 10 levels previous because i only have so many coins. But other than that the game is great!
"My town is very fun to look at and to configure. Wheat is free, and there are many types of accessible boosters to use in game play, so it only takes time and strategy to feel like a winner. Because I am enjoying the many ways to earn income, and the very forgiving editing mode to beauty up my town, I don't even mind patiently setting up and waiting for my prizes. Obsessed right now."
"2nd review. After playing this game for several years I find that it is still fun to play. I'm not progressing very fast - I'm only at level 81. It is entirely possible to play this game without purchasing a lot of InApp. Purchases. I only purchase the gold passes. There's several ways to get Township cash. I don't find much use for it except to upgrade factories. You don't need it for the mini games either. Just get better at playing the games - after all, they're repeated enough times."
Good addicting game. Going out what it is like to start a town all the way from farming to feeding to buying raw items to making things for the town. The more you learn and the more you play the bigger and better the town gets. I love the random games that come up that feature everything from skiing to driving cars to jumping to buildings to falling balls. I have been playing more than 60 days in a row and don't plan to stop anytime soon.
"I love the graphics. If you look in the ocean, where the water is lit, you can see little fish or Manta ray sometimes. I appreciate the detail. I have some vision problems, but even without my glasses, I can read and see the game details really well. I think the in-game coin system is great. We seem to get enough coins for our efforts. I have a happy little town going. 😃"
"Love playing the game. However, it takes so much effort to build up your community and there's so much going on between airport/ train / helicopter orders it's dang near impossible to get anywhere. Update: there's bugs in the mine. The chests get stuck and don't let me open. I have a suggestion or two. It would be nice to be able to send ore and ingots to other players just like other products. And it would be helpful to be able to choose the amount needed when requesting products in chat."
"I love this game. It is very addicting but challenging too. I love that the farm changes with the seasons. I do wish that you could reserve items for the helicopters like you can for the zoo, planes, and trains. It's hard to remember everything you are making and for what area. I've accidentally given away items then realized I was making it for a helicopter order."
"Totally addictive! My absolute favorite game, love the events and regattas but really wish we could give away building supplies like we do with everything else we make. I also would like to see how many tasks each player has completed in previous weeks in the regatta; would make building a strong team easier. Overall, a really great game👍🏼👍🏼😊"
Excellent game with a variety of mini-games that adds enough flavour to the everyday tedium of the gameplay. Maybe leveling up might be challenging but overall gameplay is decent if you enjoy the mini-games and harnessing a lot of coins whilst building your town. The upside: you can actually take a hiatus from the game and not stand to lose out on any of the important time-sensitive tasks in the game!
"I love this game, probably a little too much. Some downsides is it gives you videos to watch at the helicopter pad for coins or Tcash and sometimes the game just resets and you get nothing. Free ad for them I guess. It would be nice to have some ways to dump production boxes or crops miss planted. However if they do, it would probably cost Tcash which isn't always easy to come by. It takes time and I love the game, I just need to learn to not stare at the game and get a life....."
"Very nice game. The satisfaction of developing something and seeing it grow is seldom in mobile games these days. Although there are plenty of microtransactions in the game that can speed things up, I never feel at a disadvantage and everything can be unlocked for completely free. There's also a lot of ways to cooperate with your friends which is great incentive to progress further. Overall it's a fantastic option for anyone looking for a new game to sink some time into!"
"This game is addicting and guaranteed to keep you entertained! There's always something to do, it has several mini games within the original game and so many expansion possibilities. It starts off slow so you don't feel too overwhelmed, and most of the mini games are optional so you don't have to get more involved to keep the main game going, but they're available if you want more to occupy your time with."
Great game I love it.🥰 Its an enjoyable game helps to pass the time. Run races great prizes to be earned and love the mini games makes it more interesting. However it could be a bit challenging after a while to be able to purchase items you need as the prices tend to get real high.🤔 You do get opportunities to earn township cash that allows you to buy other great items which is a plus.👍 Great game would recommend. Also highly addictive 🤪and time consuming.
"I've always loved games like this when I had a desktop. But now that it's mobile, I can carry it anywhere! It's interactive with other players, but also independent, which I like. There is always something to be ""doing"" for the town. I've invested a little bit of my own money (like 20$ over two months) for ""towncash"" for a few extra items, or to make things run faster, but purchasing things is not required to make the game fun!"
"This game teaches in a very simple way about utilization of natural resources, product making, sales, helping each other in business, building and designing a town. Overall a very good game. Only downside I feel is that after a certain point, the progress in experience bar gets very slow which dampens the curiosity to explore unlocked features in the game."
"Not only does the game keep u interested, it also has multiple mini games that continously makes u want to log-in everyday and compete for more prizes. Virtual Crack. 👍🏼👍🏼😆 The competition tasks, Fruit Stand, Airplane, & Industrial Magnate, are fun and they break up the monotony. However, the tasks are becoming repetitive and boring for the regular Regattas. Also, the limit # placed on completed tasks for Regatta points, is no bueno."
"What a fantastic game! Simple on the outset, with more complex and team-based activities layered on top. There is always something to do, the events are a ""greatest hits"" of other mobile games, and best of all, the game does NOT waste my time! No obnoxious ads to sit through. In-app currency is cheap, and not needed to progress in the game. This is how to do it right."
"This game is a lot of fun. You get to design your own town, compete against other players, and it has cute special effects that update with the seasons. A few things were confusing, like how to see when others need help and send them products. Or how to get them connected to my co-op, but with others help I figured it out. Thank you for the wonderful game."
"I love this game! Finally a game that is motivating and provides many rewards that helps you constantly build your city. Unlike the other games, I do not have to constantly make purchases to buy or make needed items. I love how the game allows other people to help you build your city. Great concept. I need to discover a quicker way to get building materials. :)"
"I love Township! I've been playing the game for 4 years and enjoy it today just as much as I did 4 years ago. Like any free game, there are tempting incentives to buy in-game currency, but unlike others, Township is not designed so that buying currency is necessary for progression. Also, the Township crew continually adds to the game through either new bulidings, events, or mechanics. Township is an excellent city- development game, and I totally recommend it to anyone interested in the genre!"
Addictive. Great game. I've been playing for 4 or 5 months and have not gotten tired of it yet. They make changes often. There are often mini games within and a regatta every week where you rely on others to race and help fill your orders. Building your town almost seems like it happens on its own as you play. Once you level up to 20 something you start building your zoo. That's almost like another game within the game. Just play it. You'll love it.
"Just downloaded its seems ok for now. Edit: after playing this game for several months now the only big suggestion I can offer is to make our towns visible from any direction so that we can properly view our decorations! I love it so far and no glitches or slowing down so far! Edit: However! They have recently gotten shabby with the mini games. Its the same ones, gumball machine, candy crush remodeling, building bridge, and roller coaster games. I miss the frogger type game with the traffic!"
"Cant get enough. Ive been playing for over a year now! Its addicting and pretty fulfilling with something to do all the time. I spend minimal money to keep playing..but thats your choice. They give you opportinuty with game play to make the points in order to keep playing. Or you dont have to spend a dime to play for as long as I have. If youre on the fence, give it a try. You wont be disappointed."
"It's fun and addicting. It takes some planning and strategy. There are little games and challenges within the game, so the main goal is to grow your town, but it's not always the same because there are several different types of challenges you can do. The game works well functionally. Glitches are very rare. You CAN play without in-app purchases. Accomplishing things will take a little longer, but there are other ways to earn cash and things, like in the aforementioned smaller games within it."
"i love playing this game! it may seem silly, but i love getting to do so many different things. the simple tasks & challenges make it more interesting. being part of a co op is rewarding & getting to help other players as well is cool. i love the creativity of the game & how much it allows me to truly make my town my own. i also love getting to name all the animals in the zoo."
"Love this game. So many aspects to it, plus always special contests going on along with holiday or seasonal decor to obtain. New stuff at every level. And completely playable without spending real money. Although I do on occasion. My all time favorite. I still have never gotten bored with it. I also enjoy the many players from around the world that I encounter. Highly recommend for any age group. Young and old alike will get endless hours of entertainment from Township Kudos to the developers."
"I really like this game because you can develop your town with or without spending alot of money to develop your town. And they have very nice decorations to decorate the town with that you don't have to earn or spend a lot of money on like the Super City Game.. I wouldn't mind a little more time between competitions, however, and more upgrade materials coming quicker. Thanks."
"There are so many different aspects of this game that make it a five star. The animations are absolutely adorable, for one, but this game is like several mini-games rolled into one and there's always something new coming out. You have the mining (which is itself a puzzle), growing, and producing, and disembarking ships for goods and possibly prizes, but there are also things like the regatta and color splash events to do. Apparently there is also a zoo to manage in the higher levels. I'm super excited to see the cute animals and animation and how they constructed that part of the game as well. Along with all of that, your co-op turns into something closer to friendships than just a group of gaming partners. It requires some thought and time management. And DEFINITELY some impulse control. However intrinsic we like to believe our motives for helping others are, in this game we get external rewards for helping each other out too. Decorating/editing can be just as fun and time consuming once you expand your territory and have t-cash to do so.... I could play this game all day and never get bored. Patience is key. Play it! NAOW."
"This game is a ""grow your city"" game, and I LOVE it! I haven't gotten everything figured out yet, but I'm just going slowly and doing a little bit at a time! I wish it was possible to buy certain things in an unlimited number! Like farm plots! And I wish there was no charge for growing your storage! It's frustrating when you can't get or keep things you know that you are going to need! But, overall it is a fabulous ap, wonderful graphics, cute inside games, so kudos to those hard at work on it! Hugs, Di"
"This game is really fun. I love that I can play & progress without spending a bunch of real money. That's huge for me since I don't have much money, but like the game. My only problem is everything is really small, partially due to my phone beibg smaller, but it's also the game,(I used to play on a bigger screen). I can't zoom in enough to see things in detail, or out enough to see my whole town at once. Those are such minor issues tho, so I give 5☆'s for a Great, Fun, Game!!"
"I love this game -- there is lots to do beyond town development, such as mini games, helping friends, teaming up with other players for races, etc. It can be a big time sink! My quibble with it is that it would be nice if there were more ways to earn the cash used to speed up trains, airplanes, open chests, etc. It is very tempting to spend real money."
"Professor experiments event is awesome!! Love that we have a chance to get more and various rewards!! One problem, I noticed today, it looks like I'm not getting the generous customer reward for my helicopter orders anymore. Still in 2nd week of the event, so should still be collecting this until the end of the event. I did buy the gold pass and am up to 40% more coin bonus. Hopefully, tech support can fix this. Ty Playrix, for a great game!!"
I like the game but please make it so you can turn the buildings to face any direction you want. They can only face two directions and when you want your town to look realistic and nice that really gets in the way of that. It would also be great if there was an option to zoom all the way out and see my entire town without all of the descriptions of buildings. Sometimes I just wanna look at the entire town and see how it looks but I can't because you can only zoom out so far
"Super fun, cute graphics, lots of events and new things to explore. Love the zoo and the animals. Really like the ability to decorate and redecorate the town layout. At first I wasn't sure why there wasn't more ability to chat between players, but in the end I like that it creates a nicer and more helpful environment than other online spaces. I only wish we could search for and add irl friends easily and be notified that they are also playing."
Nicely made game with well thought out gameplay. This game has been sucking up most of my free time. It does require a bit of planning but that's the fun part. Also everything can literally be earned with game play itself if you are patient but I wouldn't mind paying in later stages because it rewards the developers for creating a beautiful ad free experience.
"I have played this game for years but now all of a sudden I'm having issues getting into my regatta screen to finish my tasks... the game crashes... ive done everything I can think of, cleared the cache, data, un-installed and re-installed the game. Everytime I go back into the game I have to redo my task. Im at a point that I don't want to play anymore... everything else works fine in the game... Edit (as of April 2022) the game has been updated and everything works like normal! Thank you!"
Great app! Had it for a long time! You always have something to do on the app. The only thing that has ever bothered me was the wait time for some of the things in the game. For example; building a house can take 8 hrs when its just a small litlle house but that is just part of the game and you can speed it up using the money you easily earn on the game. Positively amazing game!
"Love this game! Building my town from the ground up is challenging, yet exciting! Gotta love the challenge! I like the graphics, but because I'm a stickler for detail...I'm hoping updates can be made to feature cars and people actually driving and walking over the decorative bridges . Other than that...this game is the best!"
"It's a great game! The only thing I wish that was improved is there turning system. In the next update can you guys make it to where we can turn everything 360 degrees please. Some things barely turn at all, the entrance just switches sides. It is highly annoying when you are trying to arrange things"
"Great way to pass the time. Easily addicting- only faults I've come across is it's not that easy to gain ""Township cash"". So when you want to buy seasonal items you can either buy their cash with real money or hustle several weeks to have enough to buy a few items. Also, it's really hard to gain tools to expand your land and build your buildings. They send them on the trains and they are random so sometimes it'll be days even weeks before you get that one last tool you need."
"This game is fun to play and has several different things to do that keep it challenging. If you can afford to, it's easier if you pay for the guy to find things to fill requests but can be just as fun without spending anything. The hardest thing is having enough coins and materials but stick with it and eventually after lvl 75 or so you start catching up. Find a good team (Harvest Reapers) to back you up and start personalizing your town. Good luck."
"So much better than the old addictive Farm game. More options, lots of extras, just better game play and cute graphics. Oh and your crops don't die if you dont play daily! There is strategy to this game but anyone can play. You play at your own pace and don't get penalised. If you want to play competitively the challenges are available. You can spend money on the game but it's not forced or necessary. Yes, there are ads to keep it free but they are minimal. A+ to the developers!"
"I play everyday. It's very addictive. For those having a hard time earning, you just need to play and the rewards will come. It takes time. I'm on level 58 and I've been playing for almost 3 months. I earn cash pretty easy from ads, the plane, and achievements. Also the events! I've upgraded my trains to 19/18 so I get material pretty quick. It takes time but you have to work on it to upgrade to get things quicker."
"Really fun game! i usually get bored quickly with games but this has enough going on to make it continually interesting and keep the attention od my ADHD addled mind. i would love to see an option under the ""orders"" tab to see a full list of items that need to be produced all on one losr rather than have to toggle between the orders. the option to trade other players for items and building materials would be nice too."
This game is full of continuous never ending fun. You never run out of options and it's not like a candy crush type of game where you run out of moves or get stuck on a level for ever. Plus there's always freebies and mini games to keep you interested. In the beginning it might move a little slow but that changes
"This is the one game I have continued to play, on a daily basis, for a couple of years now. Usually I download a game, play for a bit, then delete when I get bored. Not this one. Gameplay is solid, social aspect is not demanding, nor really required if you choose to skip it. In game events are enjoyable and visuals (i.e. art style) are good quality. Only pick point is that they took away the national flags 😥. Bring them back, pretty please 🥺?!"
"I like this game WAY too much! Update - Still enjoying this game. Wish there was the option to turn the screen to see the town from different angles. UPDATE - enjoy this game very much-biggest issue is, as you attain higher levels & your buildings become more expensive, you cannot complete them with spending ""money"" to purchase supplies you need. If you don't have enough game money you are naturally expected to spend ""real"" money. Very difficult to fill orders when all modes compete."
"I enjoyed playing this game for 3 years on my Amazon Fire tablet. In the past year at every update there were challenges. At the last update I had to give it up. There was not enough internal storage on my tablet to install the latest update. An SD card would not work because the operating system (les than 6.0) on the tablet would not accommodate it. I purchased an Fire HD10 tablet but my 3 years of progress on the game app could mot be transferred to the new device, I would have to start from the beginning losing all my progress. I loved the game but am very disappointed in Amazon not being able to adapt through the updates."
"Great game! I love being able to decorate my town and zoo..lots of new decorations given as prizes for playing regatta, as well as holiday and events. Always something to keep busy with and look forward to with this game! Very addictive! Support is very responsive should you need them. I have been playing 700 days straight since I started. That should tell you something!😊"
"I have played this game since September 18, 2017. Currently at puzzle 9838. First and foremost, no ads! Nothing ever interrupts my game play, except the occasional glitch when it won't load, which is more likely an issue with my phone. Next, the colors, music, and graphics are exceptional! It's actually a really beautiful game to play, if you have the patience. The storyline is goofy at times, but so endearing! Austin is truly a digital dreamboat! All the characters are great! Great free game!"
"I'm past level 5,000. I've enjoyed this game a lot. There are no mini games (not sure why that's advertized), but there are seasonal challenges etc...I've never been able to finish one, but I've also never paid for anything in the game. I like that it gets more challenging as you go. There are levels I've gotten stuck on for a while, but eventually you can beat them. There is no time element, which I like because I don't have to pause or lose my progress."
Started playing in 2020 love it! Have to admit I'm addicted to it. I've actually caught myself saying bye to characters in the game. 😁 My only complaint is the way it makes it so hard to actually complete the events unless you spend money. I have yet been able to complete an event. But even that doesn't change my 5 stars. Also when you lose a level and you have lots of power ups.You lose all of them. That sux .you should lose 1 with each loss. Other than that.. i will never delete!💜💕
"Love this game so much🥰❤️some levels can be hard but that's ok! It upsets me that when you reach the highest level & start getting trophies you don't get stars anymore & can't continue to fix the garden, at least we're in a competition for the coins when collecting trophies so that's also ok!Recently you guys had that mini matching game(literally matching) I'm not sure what it was called but I really loved it so much I hope that you guys bring it back again🙏 I also love th adventure mini games"
"This game is SO much fun. Perfect game to relax with and pass the time. It's a little bit challenging but Not too hard, And I get to rebuild my own mansion. It's interactive and has a whole bunch of mini games, and I have to finish these mini games in order to keep progressing in the game. I recently got a new phone and I absolutely HAD to reinstall Gardenscapes. Truly a great game. 👍"
"The easy levels with boosters are sometimes taking 6 or 7 times before you beat them. The game where you get 300 coins, if you don't beat it you lose all of your boosters. THIS game isn't as fun as it was. It seems like the boosters aren't as many as they were in the lower levels. Its harder to finish the expeditions and again you get less boosters. My rating is 3 stars. now"
"I've played both Homescapes and Gardenscapes and the second game is quite different from the first. The game mechanics differ, forcing you to come up with alternate strategies to solve the puzzles. Also, some tasks take time rather than being done instantly, giving me a greater sense of accomplishment. I look forward to delving deeper into the game and discovering what else makes the second game unique."
I've played this for 2 years and in my opinion it's the best matching game. Levels are challenging enough to make it fun but not so hard that you'll get stuck for more than a few days. There are plenty of ways to get powerups and coins without spending real money. I just have one problem: the advertising for this game on other apps is horrible. The ads show a completely different game; one where you choose items to get someone out of situations which is completely unrelated to any real gameplay.
"Overall it's a good game. Some of the levels are ridiculously hard considering it takes almost 30 min just for one life to come back. Also, sometimes it switches items place before you've even told it to move them and its killed some levels for me. Over all not bad, but with how long it takes for lives to come back I doubt I'll be playing it much longer."
My favorite game of the dozens I have tried. I've been playing for over a year and its still challenging. Also one of the rare games you don't have to pay to play. As long as you are persistent you can score high in the contests without spending any money at all. Absolutely the best puzzle match game ever. Plus it has a fun story line with lots of choices on how you want things decorated. I love seeing the areas I unlock become beautiful.
"I love both gardenscapes and homescapes, but I wish the game developers would make a few changes in how we play the game. I think while you're playing a level they should give you a undo button so you could undo a mistake. I think they should give more time for events decorations and not make the levels so hard so that we can get all the decorations, and I think you should get 2 or 3 stars for harder levels"
"not just a match 3 game. With exploding bombs and other tools to defeat levels, then you work towards improvements in the garden. While your choices of improvements are limited, it is still fun to watch the landscape come together. At holidays, you can play to ""buy"" with money earned in the game, decorations that stay up past the holiday (until the next one comes around!) That is a very cool feature."
"Fun game. One of the best games I've played. No adds, can play offline and easy to understand. Many different events to play. Only thing I wish they would change is if u have ""unlimited lives"" and u happen to get another one, maybe be able to save it or something. There's times when I've accumulated 6 hours of ""unlimited lives"" and it goes to waste. Don't get me wrong I appreciate the ""unlimited lives"" but hate having to waste it. Still best game around!!"
Absolutely love this game! !!!   Challenging levels  make it fun and interesting.  I see people complaining about the difficulty etc but I'm guessing they don't like a challenge.  Currently on level 2267. I wish they had different  challenges for more holiday/season themed decorations . And I wish they would update the area  where we spend  gardencash. Other than i love it and would recommend it to whoever likes landscape and garden design with a twist.
"The best thing about this game is that you can skip through all the cheesy story parts. Most other games like this aren't as user friendly and force you to choke down long overly dramatic animations. Gardenscapes also gives you more choices for customization. I think it would've been even better if different types of mini games were featured, not just match-3 style. It gets too repetitive for my tastes."
"This is great. Playing the grids gives energy. The only downside is there are certain levels where you pretty much have to purchase coins or helpers in the grid to pass the level unless you save all the helpers till the hard levels. The other thing I hate is the majority of the coins you earn get put in a safe and once it reaches full, you can get all your coins....but you have to buy it. So here's where they get you"
"It's not a buy, buy waste money type of game. It's very addictive, you want to keep playing to fix your gardens and they make it easy for you to keep playing with 99cent specials and special levels that you can win 30 min-3 hrs of free time. The levels are challenging and you always want to find out how your new garden is going to turn out. Player of over a year."
"I've been playing for quite a while now and this has become my favorite game. The others, save for one, have been deleted. This game keeps me interested; some levels are relatively easy but there are plenty of levels that get me frustrated. The underlying thing though is that if you play close attention on the harder levels, a strategy can be formed to win. The best part is that you're building something the entire time; it provides you with a higher goal than just beating the next level."
"Absolutely love this game. Spend all night playing it, especially when I'm f***ed up! Lol. Although, I wish it would provide challenge levels where it let you see how many points you could get, as opposed to just making you complete tasks. For example, you are allowed a certain amount of moves and it let's you see how many points you can rack up within those moves. Other than that, an amazing game. So fun and addictive! 😊😂💯"
This game is similar to other Candy Crush matching games with its own unique challenges. There are some challenging levels that can take days to solve but it's great that you can get unlimited lives after passing one of the hard levels and not have to hope you will spin it on the wheel. The storyline is cute and the graphics really show a lot of time and energy goes into the details. Only disappointment is the ads showed more than just the matching objects and haven't seen it yet. Great game!
"It's a fun game. I wished there were more options to control where bombs were placed when using your surplus and being able to determine how many of your surplus items you may wish to use. When the system places them, they always seem to be bunched up. Other than a few other little irritations, it is a go to game to pass the time. Fun interface with Austin."
I love this game but you can obviously see the computer pausing the color or piece you need to progress. I dont know if they want you to buy there coins or what but its extremely fustrating to lose over 25 times by almost just one move. I hope its a bug and gets fixed but i get tired of playing it over and over and the computer makes you lose 85% of the time. Now i made the update and says check internet.
"I have been playing this game for years. I love it.😁 Level 2000!They update often and add new events. A few things I don't like...1- I never get to the end of any renovation, event, or golden ticket. Not without spending a ton of money out of my pocket. I would love the option to finish one for once. 2- when you have a power up for a limited amount of time it will delay by cutting back to the main screen and playing out story scenes. There should be an option to go straight to the next level."
"It's an overall well crafted game with challenging puzzles interspersed with dialogue and garden building storytelling. If you're playing with minimal purchases, reading some of the online forum blogs and videos is helpful. It takes a bit longer to progress through the game, but it's doable. Graphics are especially good and the game play obstacles are amusing. One of my favorite games I rotate through."
"I love playing this game and advancing through it. It has so many prize options and special gifts from time to time. It gets annoying when a level is extremely hard and it takes a few tries but that's the part of playing games. Not to mention the decorating part is so great. It gives really good options to fit your style. If you want everything to match, you can. If you want there to be different colors, you can. And it helps that it doesnt cost any coims to decorate or change the decor."
Love this game!! Have played it for years now. It's crazy how long some things take. And sometimes you have to cave and buy a little help or you never move on. But once you start cruising along you get going pretty well. I wish could use the unlimited lives or bonuses that last for so long at certain times. Sometimes I'll only have a few mins to play and I'll end up getting an hour bonus or something and feel like it goes to waste. And other times I need it. Any links or places with tips? LMK!!
"I love this game. Played it on my PC also, and I like this version as well! The levels do get a bit tricky and rough the higher you get. The extra little scenes you can work on take too much time and too many things to complete, especially on harder levels. I haven't been able to complete any of those before they're removed and it moves onto something else."
"Great game, Im past level 800 and so far this game has been really great for being free, I havent had to spend a single dime to enjoy it and its not super difficult, I mean some levels are very challenging but not so challenging that you just get fustrated and do not want to play it. Also with each event and extra like the daily spin if you are really on a difficult level it helps out. There is so much to do with the garden and more with each update that I always want to open a new section and see whats next. I have recommended it for others because its relaxing and they too find it addictive. I must say I dont usually play a lot of games on my cellular device but since I got this one I do more now than ever."
Addictive! I'm a garden head! Must go on! I started back up 8/2020 to find this game now keeps crashing. Did the update and all. I'll finish a level or two and either screen goes black or fuzzy green back ground. I have to close and reopen the game. Very annoying glich. Please fix. The Disco theme is cool though and mini games too.
"I've been playing this game pretty much since the launch date and love it. The gameplay experience keeps on improving, although some small graphic improvements seem unnecessary. Sure, there are times where I get frustrated because I can't seem to pass a level. But with patience and a little luck it's doable. I've managed to pass over 3000 levels and have 30,000 coins saved up WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MONEY! I'll keep on playing!"
"I really love this game. It's rewarding to beat levels which is then used in cleaning and renovating your garden. The people who are complaining don't have enough patience. I've been stuck on many levels which took multiple tries without any boosters and I eventually beat them. There is some strategist logic involved in completing a level, but it can be beat without any boosters."
"Been playing this game for a long time and it can be hard to pass some levels but I eventually always do. (I'm in the thousandsnow!) I would say the only improvement I'd like to see, and would very much enjoy is being able to continue working on old rooms though. Once a room is no longer currently able to be worked on it just stays incomplete and it can be quite hard to complete a room. I would much prefer to be able to go back somehow and finish the ones I didn't complete on the first attempt."
".love the graphics, storyline, ability to design on my own. the New choices ( decor) are great and the puzzle challenges are just right. Not too easy but not so hard you get stuck too long (days!) and cant progress ( unless you make a purchase) .. The life limit / refill ratio saves you from yourself :.) And the extra games ( dog training etc.) is fantastic! Especially on the days when you just HAVE to keep playing. :) Great job to the entire developmemt team!!!!!"
"Game that is filled with a lot of match puzzles and restoring other play areas. Some levels are difficult and it may take some time to move forward. Each new level brings challenges that make you stop and think which way to go. Playing along with Austin is fun, and you get to enyoy all of his friends and their challenges too. This game really is addictive!"
"Addictive fun that hits the perfect balance of amusement and difficulty. In the vast realm of match 3 decor games, Gardenscapes stands out as the one that is always fresh, new, and interesting. I have played A LOT of these games and this one simply can't be beat. I love all the little extras that keep the game engaging and challenging."
"A blast, but to expensive. Lower the cost of coins, expand on the allotment of moves per game, you'll get and keep more customers. I love it, have spent way too much money and will need to stop playing like really soon if they don't change a few things, just can't afford it. Ridiculously expensive!!!"
"I absolutely enjoy this game and the challenges I face with various levels of difficulties! It makes you think, strategize, and grow in your puzzle solving skills; there are SO many ways to earn coins and boosters. But if it's too easy then people get bored, if it's too hard then people complain. You just gotta keep trying, life ain't easy...learn and evolve."
"Fun game. It advertises differently than how it plays. It really is just a matching game that unlocks decorations for a garden (and cute pets as an in-app purchase)--which is a great game on its own. The characters are likeable and even have developing personalities. The danger scenarios (as seen in advertisement) are rare mini games that aren't a part of the main storyline. Despite this, I love it anyway. It's worth the in-app purchases. Very good."
I love the game SO much! VERY addicting! The levels vary from difficulty and even color coats it so you know how difficult the level is. It's not like Candy Crush where you never get through it or too tough to beat. You can pass the hard or super hard level within the same day or the next day or so. I would highly recommend it to others!
"I've been playing this game for years and have no idea what ""ads"" the negative reviews are talking about. I really enjoy the increasing difficulty and new mechanics they add as you go along, and the ""story"" of repairing the garden is meandering but cute. It's a relaxing way to pass a bit of time, and if you play regularly they give you so many free boosters I rarely get stuck on a level for more than a few days. My favorite match-three type game!"
Been playing this game for quite sometime. You have to have some patience if you wanna advance without pay. Some levels are hard and and some are easy but all are fun and challenging. Sometimes I feel like they just add tasks to use up your stars when you are trying to complete certain tasks at hand. Game is very interactive and always has some new wrinkles. One of my favorite games
"Super fun! Yes, some of the levels can be difficult, but for me - not to the extreme annoyance level where I won't play the game. I definitely like it more then I don't. Rarely any glitches, and those that show up seem to be addressed and corrected relatively quickly. I'm on a VERY high level and the game is still holding my interest. Thanks for making such a fun game! 😀"
"I enjoy this game, and I don't put any money into it whatsoever. The animation is great, there haven't been any glitches, and the levels are challenging but entertaining. Some people say it isn't possible to win the jackpot on the daily spin wheel, but I have. I clicked stop on the 2x bombs panel. UPDATE: So I have only gotten the Jackpot once more, so there really isn't a pattern for the spin wheel. Also, there are some levels that I spend DAYS trying to beat, so that sucks."
"It's been fun and I like the interaction with Austin. However it gets really aggravating when you continually run out of moves and you cannot possible win the game. On the really hard games you the designer need to give a little more flexibility to the game, either give more moves or give more bombs so that you dont have to play twenty time or more to be able to go on to the next game."
"I love the game but I hate what the ads are representing. The game is nothing like the ads. I had the game way before these weird ads started popping up and was confused because I was just playing it and it was nothing like that. This game is a match 3 game with levels to help redecorate your garden, not a ""save someone"" or ""help them at their wedding"". I dont know what's up with those, but other than that, the actual game itself if fantastic!!"
"I love the game. It's easy to use with great graphics and the storyline is great if you choose to read it. I love the puppy training games bc it gives players a chance to collect more coins. I dont like how they give away more dollars than coins bc I need coins for buying boosters, not dollars, to redecorate an already redecorated area. Other than that, it's a great game!"
"This game is a lot of fun. You build amazing gardens as you pass different levels. But besides that it has a great interactive feature. You can turn on all your street lights and lanterns thru out your gardens, change plants and statues and benches to give each garden a totally different look. I could go on and on. If there are any draw backs it would be getting stuck on some levels for to many days. That gets very frustrating. Overall a really fun way to spend your time"
The higher the level you go the harder it takes to finish which creates frustration. Patience is the key. Eventually you will pass and say thank you. The help from friends is great. I get people's frustration now no money spending no passing levels. It takes longer then you fall to the bottom of the leader board.
To my flails in game. You lose coins and boosters .I rate this a 2 after you fix the problems. I've been playing this game for 4 years. I lost way to many coins and boosters not happy!!!!!!!!!get rid of the golden cup. It's not right when you don't want to play it. You lose to many points !!!! WE SHOULD HAVE A OPPOSITION!!!!! Bring back my scores. I just got a new phone and all of my progress. Can you help
"I love this game! Yes, the levels get harder. Yes, on occasion I do use power ups, but I don't usually spend money to play. It takes time and patience to pass some of the levels and yes, it can be frustrating at times. This isn't a game for those who want immediate success and to zip through the levels. It is a game for those that can be patient and problem solve. I like being able to join a group and work together to beat competions. My one frustration is the # of point needed to finish a room."
"I love it. Honestly my only major annoyance is when a level requires you to get butterflies, and you only have a few more moves left and there are NO BUTTERFLIES on the field. I waste moves just waiting for another butterfly to enter to get a chance to get it! Argh! But other than that, yeah, I love this game. I close my eyes and see tiles of fruits. No joke."
"Best match 3 game out there. Easy game play, nice graphics, and you can play for free. Good mix of challenging levels and easy. They do lots of events to increase your chances of winning and getting bonus items. You can see your progress by the gardens you finish. Much better than a line of levels completed."
"I really love this game! The only problem is that on most levels they are pretty difficult, and they don't give you NEAR enough time before the level ends and you have to start over again, and then it will give you the option of using a bunch of coins, which is pretty much MOST of your coins a lot of the time! But then, it only gives you like 15 seconds more of time which isn't no time at all! So it's like you used all your coins for no reason! So PLEASE change this! Thanks! Emily Stallings"
"I'm almost at level 1000 and I've never spent a dime of real money to get there. I love this game because it's like candy crush, but with a point to winning. I find all the talking a side stories a bit annoying but they've added a skip button so I can blow right through it all and get back to decorating!"
"Mostly a match-3, this is one of the few games I kept even when I switched phones. It's motivating and fun to see my progress in the improvements Austin makes to the garden. Some levels can be frustrating, especially since I don't usually make in-game purchases to gain helpful advantages, but I eventually succeed. Gardenscapes also contains enough variety and events to keep my interest even when I'm burning through lives trying to get past a hard level."
"I'm on level 2,334.... I don't like this game at all. Nope. Totally not addicted and play it every day. *sarcasm* Seriously though, it's rare that you can play a game and get past levels w/o having to buy anything with your own money. You do get stuck on levels for what feels like an eternity, but once you pass it, you cruise through a few levels before getting another hard one."
game is so addicting but I agree that its very rewarding to be able to fix the garden with the stars you earn. I do believe harder levels should get 2 stars especially when some actions require 2 stars. However very good job. i also enjoy matchington mansion and am about to try the hotel one...love the concept of being able to renovate with rewards.
"My 2 wishes would be that when u are playing the match games, I want to be able to make moves while the screen is loading. We have to wait till all pieces have filled the screen before we can move and it takes up so much time. My second would be that when the characters are talking that they didn't take up so much time loading to skip that. Other than that I love the game and would recommend it for anyone."
The levels offer a good variety of obstacles and obtaining items for the garden is challenging but generally not frustrating. Pro - You don't have to spend real world money in order to get the top tier items. It will just take a while. Con - Help for in game glitches is hard to come by if not impossible.
"So much fun! I've been playing for years. Just wish the special events/remodels were a little easier to complete. I'm a level fifteen hundred and something, I play regularly and I have never been able to complete one event/remodel. Other than that the game is fun and the competitions make it interesting. My favorite is th he apple picking competition."
"Simple, easy and enjoyable. Just the right amount of difficulty on this match-3 item type of game play with the addition of a story line. The match-3, 4 or 5 is just difficult in the beginning to make you plan out your moves to get the most from each choice. After lv 80 most boards seem impossible unless you use gold which only replenishes after spending $. Most of the fun of gone and I will be deleting because of it."
"This game is super addictive! Fun to play, build a beautiful garden etc... My only complaint is that some levels seem to be designed so that, no matter how good you are, they cannot be beat without ""boosters"" which you almost always have to purchase. Very skimpy on rewardig free boosters for beating levels. Also, if you need extra play to get thru a level you must use a very large portion of extra play stars, which, again, you can earn very slowly or must by."
"Before you start scrolling through reviews, read this first. Gardenscapes is a match-3 game that allows you to build a garden/property to your preference based on wins and points. It's been my favorite casual game for a couple of years. Whenever there's been any issues, the devs have been extremely responsive, fast to resolve the issue and very kind. There are other match-3's out there, but Gardenscapes seems to care the most about the end user experience."
"This game keeps me entertained. But the ad for this game showed matching solutions to problems so I don't know if I just downloaded the wrong game or if that comes later. Also I wish these things were different: player can change Austin's appearance, make him less annoying, player can choose when and where to add boosters to board, player can suggest tasks, player can opt not to do tasks. But overall the graphics are beautiful and the game is very imaginative."
"I have been playing Homescapes forever (currently on level 2500), but would get stuck often waiting for more lives, so I decided to try Gardenscapes to pass the times when I'm stuck. I'm currently on level 225, and have been surprised at how different the games play. This one is much easier to level up, even though it doesn't include a lot of the matching powerups from Homescapes. It also has a ridiculous amount of contests to make making money and earning stars go super fast. Still, a fun game!"
Excellent free game. I've played it for several years now. Spent a dollar here or there. But you don't have to. Levels are not always easy... i have been stuck for days a couple times on one level. . But they are NOT impossible like so many say on here. Some are challenging. They have added all kinds of free stuff and extras. The game progresses nicely.
"The game is pretty alright , but as you move up in levels they get ridiculously hard to beat at least for me some of them are anyways. I mean like I'm talking about there have been a couple levels that have literally taking me a few weeks to get past , but honestly ,that's what hooked me, the challenge. If you like to challenge this is the game, it's awesome so there you have it that's my review have fun good luck playing ."
"I play both Homescapes and this game, but I always find I'm more excited when my lives refill for Gardenscapes. It's fun and relaxing to me. Plus I love the little stories sprinkled throughout. I'm not sure why I like it more then it's counterpart as they are practically the same thing. But if I had to take a guess, I'd say that Gardenscapes rewards you better for your achievements than Homescapes."
"One of my all time favorite mobile games now. I thought I was burnt-out by match 3 games, but as soon as I picked this up, I couldn't put it down. The story with the butler, renovating the massive grounds, and starting new days provides a great feeling of accomplishment. I'm on level 851 and won't stop soon, even though I probably should haha. My only (minor) complaint is sometimes boosters mess up the set up of a level, and they end up hindering instead of helping. Great game! Thanks, devs!"
"It's a blast building, decorating & creating beautiful, new spaces. The rewards and prizes as are really good & you're not forced to have to buy that many power ups too often. When you do purchase them, you get a fair amount. For me, that kind of thing has been a real downfall and disappointment in many other games."
"I love this game!! I got hooked to a different match-3 game, but was bored with it. I found Gardenscapes and was hooked to the story! It's fun having a goal to pass levels (you collect stars to complete tasks that renovate the garden). Being able to choose and change the decorations throughout the garden are also fun. (I'm currently playing level 1637 😊)"
"This game is just plain awesome. Just in case you're wondering there is a way to beat the levels without coins or powerups. Love the challenge! It's like a free IQ test ha ha! I figure you have to get your whole family together is the goal of the game and maybe then you can play the ""choose and help them"" part of the game depicted in the advertisement. I consider myself a pro gamer but never saw a game so challenging, so this is a refreshing change from console or pc titles. Free or cheap not bad"
"I have played since the beginning. I will continue to play until they stop creating new levels. I have never spent a single cent and have had no issues with progress. Excellent game all around. And i believe it was the first ""match game"" to include another level of play by rewarding you with restorations of areas within the game. Always new and exciting themed challanges! A++"
"This is the second match game I ever got. The first was Homescapes. These are the best out there. The rewards are great and the game play is fun. Granted the cost of boosters is not cheap. I have spent money on in game purchases, but it's worth it. Most of the other games I have, the opposite is true. Really bad game board rewards, ridiculous cost for boosters, etc. It's insulting. This is worth the download."
"This game is so fun that I forget to work. Very addicting, always wanting to see what's going to happen. I'm on level 478 and there are 2 berrios that won't match up. When I tap on them they make the sound of chains, even though I've gotten rid of their chains. I don't like to be frustrated with a game that I've progressed so far and spent so much on."
"I've been playing this game for over a year now and I absolutely LOVE IT! great game to play yes some levels are very difficult to pass but thats what makes it fun and if you need extra coins to pass a level you only need 99 cents for 1000 coins, i don't think that's a bad idea its actually pretty cool. Love this game and I'm on level 1012 now. Best game I've ever played. Definitely over 5 starts."
"Good game. Skip anything not pertaining to the garden upkeep, like doing things for the dog, etc. The side games and other earning options are cool. However, you guys could (Should); do away with unleashing things and creepy statues. The fore mentioned and especially the latter, made me delete Homescapes even after getting so far. Otherwise, I am thoroughly enjoying GardenScapes. Thanks! 🤔😀"
"The game keeps freezing on a Rock Season cut scene. The cut scene starts as soon as I hit play, so I can't even do anything else in the game. I have tried: 1. Restarting my phone and reopening the app several times. 2. Clearing the game cache several times. 3. Uninstalling and reinstalling the game several times. My phone more than meets the minimum and suggested requirements. I put in a support ticket and the issue is still not resolved. Issue is now resolved and game is back to awesomeness"
"This is a fun game, it's moderately hard, but can be extremely hard at times. It's similar to all the(candy crush) games, as in it's a match the tiles, but that's it. You earn starts that are used to build up the appearance of your garden and so on. There's also times that you compete against other players to win gifts (firecrackers, Dynamite, power discs, coins and free lives etc) which can be used to beat super hard levels. I've played for years, and it's still a fun game!"
"All around good game. Challenging at times, but could also use a few more of the ""dream"" levels because that is what the subscriber thinks they are downloading. A game to solve different scenarios. Some may think 🤔, but have enjoyed building my garden, joining a team, and participating in different challenges!"
"fun game! I like this version better than the one they had about 7 years ago when I played last, it's much more enjoyable and I like that I can swap out my design choices without paying extra. going one surprise step at a time, its hard to know how it will come together in the end and allowing changes keeps me from becoming frustrated with the game. very nice fix!"
"This is a fun puzzle game, it's set up between gambling and puzzle solving. You never know what pieces you're going to start the level with, and that's fun. One request though, could we have the ability to earn the holiday collections after the time is up for them? I keep missing out on getting the full set because of time, and I would like to collect them all. You could even set it up like Andy's designs, just, let us have the option to get more things and personalize our gardens more please."
"Such an awesome game, for sure one of my go to's. Been playing since 2016 and there were times where I was frustrated with the game, especially when I had one level that took weeks of trying to get through it. Now you guys added several awesome things to the game making it so much fun and helps you out with earning power ups to get you through a level. Unlike other games, I don't feel like I have to purchase things to progress and i wish others are just like you. Thank you"
"Update 2021: Still playing, moved up to 10th from 26th in my league, and I have never purchased anything to get ahead. So it is possible. (One year later, actually enjoy the game even more. The team and challenges add the needed interest to keep it fun. I also have achieved a lot in spite of refusing to guy any gifts or packages.)) i enjoy the game, it can be especially challenging when you are one who refuses to buy packages, chest."
"Great game until you added the propane tanks, would be ok with them if the computer would generate more matches to disable. Very frustrating to play everytime they appear, levels are hard enough with a few, now you added so may that it is almost impossible to complete. A little better as of lately would be nice if you added more ways to earn coins....enough with the honey."
"I'm changing my rating to a 5 since I think the extra features they added to the game help it flow so much better than when I first started playing it when it didnt have those features. Its such a beautiful and relaxing game. I love the music, the garden themed match three games, and all the beautiful options for the garden itself. A great game to relax to :)"
This game is really cute. I love the little storylines and decorating the landscape of the manor. The match 3 part of the game keeps things interesting by changing things up and it's just the right amount of a challenge. Some levels take a while to conquer but I always do. Definitely recommend it.
"UPDATE: Still love this game! TO THE DEVELOPERS: I would love to be able to revisit the various renovations and continue working on them. Running out of time is so frustrating. Thank you for this consideration. ---------------------- The developers have incorporated many rewards and variations which keep the game interesting and fun; it is never boring. Good graphics, also! Well done!"
I absolutely love this game! I've been playing for years. My favorite thing is when you can buy decorations for a plot of farm. Like the hogwarts one was so much fun. The dragon was too! I miss the extra decorations we used to be able to buy with garden bucks? I wish an option like that would happen again. However. I love this game. And I will play until there are no new levels. Great job guys!
"I have been playing this game for years. Level 8848 right now. I think its well designed, entertaining the events are always clever and fun! If I had one critique, it would be to make the goals for events and renovations more attainable. I can't complete an event w/o multiple purchases and sometimes I just don't participate if I dont want to spend $. I understand this may be how the creators make money on the game but it would be nice to have a completed reno from all the work and time put in."
"The graphics are gorgeous! The game is fun and challenging for all age levels. The characters are charming, and the story line is engaging. My only issues are that the gate opens automatically, allowing the dog to walk to the street alone, and at times characters ignore each other (for example the dog) when one would expect that they would briefly interact."
"Fun and challenging. I'm a level 1545 and I've never spent real money on the game. Yes, later levels can get difficult and frustrating, but keep playing and eventually you'll pass. Save your boosters and don't just use them all the time. Take advantage of when you have infinite lives. Play smart. If you're looking for something easy, then this isn't for you, go play solitaire or with building blocks. 02/08/20 - after update, game crashes when I beat a level. Can't seem to progress. Pls fix!!!!"
"this is my addictive go to game. sometimes they are hard with the levels but I think they do learn and respond to comments. was so glad when the times levels stopped!! updated 4-28. the latest even is quite sucky. instead of getting a couple of hours of unlimited play after beating several levels, you now have to beat 10 levels on your first try to get anything. I'll give you it's a nice little reward chest. But I never beat levels on the first try so its impossible. terrible addition"
"I had recently rated this game 5 stars just to get the annoying ads that popped up (like any other app) that says ""Do you like our game? Rate it in the App Store"" ... anyways, I came back to give a real review after 4 months of playing it every day. There has been several levels I just could not pass easily. Then different levels that I could get by quickly. I enjoy that. I like that it ranges from easy to difficult and isn't just plain hard levels once you reach a certain level. I love it!"
"it's a great game to pass the time I've been playing it for a few years I've even bought stuff at times it's not bad. It does take up a lot of storage and data which I was ok with. but of course it seems like a lot of these games are recently doing now, it seems every level is lagging very badly ,also its freezing and restarting itself only to keep doing it even though my roommate has the, best of the best sir, internet you could get.Pleass please fix I really love your game"
"The game is fun. You can whip through many levels, but then you get stuck on the hard ones. Overall, i like the game. The puzzles let the storyline move without needing lots of stars for every little thing. That would bog the game down and make it less fun."
"I love the creativity of the game. There is always something new adding to the game. It's not too hard to win in some levels, and for the harder levels , they allowed to play for a certain times to win the games which is good since some players may get tired of playing over and over again, but couldn't win. It helps players keep coming back to play. Also the rewards of unlimited lives from time to time makes it's very addictive to the game. Love it!!!"
"Meh 😕 I love it but I hate that the mini games don't let me opt out. I have to press ""go"" and then go back. Then it's become more puzzles than games. It freezes sometimes too and then I lose my progress and lose a life. I'd love to be able to play offline as well."
Love the challenges this game provides. Sometimes I do have to spend a little £££ but you don't have to. I'm just impatient on hard levels. I've been on this game for well over 4 years and I love it. The extra challenges like the farming is great but really miss the dog training extra as used to get loads of goodies..... Also miss the fact there not an alliance pack to buy where by everyone would get a combo when a person in the team purchases something.
"I am really enjoying the game so far. The puzzles are decently challenging, and the graphics are adorably detailed. I definitely look forward to opening new areas and discovering new features. I would definitely have to give it 5 stars thus far and have high hopes as I continue playing that the game will continue to impress."
"It's somewhat difficult to fire where you want it to fire...by somewhat I mean, you're facing one way to fire and he, for some reason, turns around and fires in the wrong direction. The levels are pretty repetitive, mostly just adding more complicated maps and more mutants. All of this is fine because the actual gameplay is very good. I have a lot of fun. My only real complaint. For God sakes, move the respawn button away from the restart floor button 🤦🏼‍♂️. It's so easy to press the wrong one and end up starting all over again."
"I have been trying many top-down shooters, and this one gives the feel of an over-the-shoulder shooter with top-down controls. I love it! The graphics are beautiful (I ran it with 50 percent res and max graphics, so it runs smoothly)! My only criticism would be that there isn't an endless or a roguelike mode, because I don't want to stop playing yet. Thanks for the reset option though."
"Fun and addicting. Very fun to grind for upgrades. No invasive ads. Ads are optional to view, and very rewarding when you do. The rewards grow with each level you pass. So if you can't progress and need a better weapon, watch a couple short ads or replay a couple previous missions for a better score, and in no time you are buying a bigger weapon and squashing the next level! It's like if you mixed the games, ""Smash the Office,"" with ""Doom!"" I'm loving it! Thanks!"
"The first time a free game wasn't shooting ads in my face every 10 seconds. Gameplay is reminiscent of Alien Swarm. It doesn't hold your hand, you might actually have to use your brain to pathfind through a level. The difficulty is fair, all around, looks like the kind of game that's worth someone's time. Makes me want to actually support the dev."
"Absolutely love it! This game delivers. Love how the ads for money works. Some ads are just 5 seconds! The progression with weapons and armor a is spot on. Almost no hindrances. The graphics are amazing for the virtual size of the game. I been searching the app store high and low and found this. Every now and then a blind squirrel finds a nut! Maybe more different types of gear would be a good addition? Things do seem pricey, but money is easily acquired through light grinding. 😀"
"Great top down shooter. Good weapon progression. One of very few games I played thru. Looking forward to the #2. 5 stars for sure. Maybe add 3 times the weapons, a couple skill trees, a test level for gear, more diverse level look, more diverse monsters, a lot more places and levels, and a short story. Let me know if you have a game engine i could download or if I can create a story line and skill tree for you guys. I'd love to help develop #2 or an expansion."
"This is a really great game, it's fun and unique the only thing I have to say bad about it is that the levels look and feel the same, but no biggie, you could do alot of things to make the levels feel different. I recommend that you render the lighting differently and uniquely, that would really set a creepy feeling to the levels."
"Thus far I have been able to play through the game with only what you start with, and I am already at the military base. Alltho you will eventually need to get better weapons and armor with in game currency, which you get at the end of each mission. That said the controls are pretty smooth and easy to get the hang of. There is a great supply of guns and armor to purchase , again with in game currency, which you get better versions of as time goes on. There are plenty of different enemy's and hazards to overcome, and plenty of different missions to fight them in. Overall this is my favorite top down game I have played yet. Thanks for the great game Pixelbite."
"I'm surprised by how much fun this is. I love how it doesn't interrupt the experience, I don't get pop up ads every single time I die, the graphics look good and run smooth for mobile, and the controls are surprisingly usable too. i didn't feel like I was at a major disadvantage by playing on my phone. One issue I have is that there doesn't seem to be much point to the secondary weapons if the primary is generally better and has unlimited ammo with no need to reload. overall, it's a good time."
"Pro - Amazing graphics - Engaging gameplay for a while - Not pay to win Cons - Controls are a bit sloppy, especially in hectic situations - It gets very repetitive. All the levels are basically the same. There are maybe 5 basic kinds of enemies and 5 kinds of guns. As you progress enemies just get more powerful as do your guns. - Difficulty increases exponentially. About two thirds of the way through most enemies can kill you in one or two hits. Fortunately there isn't a real penalty for dying"
"Pretty awesome. A twin stick shooter with equipment upgrades. It works out of the box with my USB-C controller, and I couldn't be happier. It feels like a proper top-down action RPG, bit you can literally pick it up and clear a level with only five minutes to spare. Easy to pick up, have a minute of fun, and quit. Haven't even seen a single ad. This is not your usual Android store garbage."
"Mindless entertainment, but a solid game nonetheless. I like Space Marshals 2 better personally because it involves stealth and ingenuity, but if you're looking for a more straightforward shoot-'em-up, this is a really good one. The camera management is my biggest complaint, but it's not so bad, really. The enemies are plentiful and the violence is frenetic. Another great Pixelbite game!"
Very awesome game! I enjoy all the armors and weapons to unlock and upgrade. The difficulty is amazing and challenging. I love all the levels you can finish and the storyline is really great too! The graphics are amazing and the controller support as well. Its very responsive. The mutants are really fun to kill! The game is very fun and addicting. Good job guys on this game and keep making awesome games!
"An excellent game. Well designed and balanced to keep the game challenging as you press through the levels. I love that the ads are completely optional, and that the ad bonus scales with the game to keep it enticing. I enjoyed this game so much, I immediately purchased your space cowboy shooter and am looking forward to playing it next."
"i love top down shooters and this one is quality for a mobile game. using your thumbs on a screen for a twin stick shooter takes some getting used to but the game seems like its designed with the lack of accuracy of screen sticks in mind so it works pretty damn good. its also pretty atmospheric too for a mobile game, cool lighting effects, good alien shooter music and has good sound design. It has leveling and upgrades of weapons and armor, the kind that keeps you playing for that next levelup"
"This game is incredible and it only gets better the stronger your weapons get and the higher the number of monsters are. Kill streaks are super satisfying with high pay off. a few bucks gets you a solid amount of credits and credits in general aren't super hard to come by. Either way, weapons upgrade with use and a lot of the lower tier ones still pack a punch. At first the camera angle was weird but once I got used to it, I realized it actually benefits the game's atmosphere."
"Ok so I normally never rate or review, I have tried a lot of mobile shooter games and if you want a quick session game able to be paused between moment to moments through your day this game is for you. No pop ups, no ads, no incentives to spend money but a good all around top down shooter to play on your break or on a bus or taking a walk. By far one of the best mobile shooters I've ever played, so much to write up a review. Small but decent weapon list with armor upgrades and weapon upgrades."
"AWESOME!. This game has tons of levels and areas keeping everything fresh so nothing feels repetitive. It also has tons of unique guns with abilities , powers and upgrades and it keeps the game interesting. The best part is its completely free and skill based just like a normal game should be so nothing takes forever to unlock and all weapons , suits, powers and levels are unlocked by simply progressing and killing enemies. This game is refreshing and done RIGHT. Thank you!"
No other shooter game like it! This is one of the coolest new games I've seen. The controls will take you a minute but are easily mastered. Reminds me of my younger days playing Robotron with its left and right right way controls for movement and firing. Quick levels (floors) make this an easy time killer.
Super fun but not super hard to figure out either. You only watch ads if you want in game credit to upgrade weapons and armor. And they reward nicely for watching ads that it doesnt take much to get the upgrades required to progress through the levels. Entertaining with plenty of destruction on aliens!
"This is a f***ing amazing game! Unlike literally any other shooter on Google play, this is a simply shooter which is not spamming you with Ad and gives a fair opportunity to decide, whether it's worth spending money on it. And it definitely is: highly detailed (perhaps, unnecessary for this kind of mechanics), with great graphic and controls. Two improvements suggestion: 1) camera lock option; 2) scale control: despite my screen size, sometimes can't see enemies in front of me."
"Great game. Doesn't have much of a story but the gameplay is really good. It has loads of frantic action and requires a lot of focus, so IMHO it is best to play it in short bursts. My Bluetooth gamepad was recognized automatically and all controls worked out of the box, must say it makes playing the game even better. HUGE thumbs up for the business model, there are no intrusive ads in the game, a very rare sight nowadays."
"I'm giving five stars because of how rating in app stores works, even if it is not a perfect game. There's a few things that could be improved (see below) but it is still a fun game that is absolutely worth your time. Feedback: (Playing on a one+7t) -Since you can't see very far you mostly hose down corridors with auto fire when you see red blips on the map - you rarely get to see the cool monsters and semi auto weapons are mostly useless. -music is pretty generic -setpieces repeat a lot"
"This game is absolutely AMAZING! Tons of stages, though repetitive at some point, it never fails to bring better and better challenges every time. It's offline and an excellent game to play especially to kill time (and those nasty alien monsters). This game reminds me a lot of the Metroid series but the devs sure did put their own fresh take and brought brilliant ideas and twists into the mix. I just hope they could add more variety of monsters or a whole new area to explore. Perhaps I'd love to see those on a sequel please!"
"Good graphics, great gameplay, balanced difficulty, simple controls that are VERY easy to understand, and 10% of the game are ADS! This is by far the best mobile game I've ever played in my entire life! One thing that's missing though... Local Multiplayer! Please add this feature, I can see myself laying down on my bed all day playing this game WITH my brother for hours upon hours upon hours upon hours! There's also 1 problem... The camera zooms too much that I can't see incoming enemies. 5/5"
"This is a really great game, just let down by a couple of things. Every floor seems the same and the factory run just stops being challenging until the last level. Other than that, the gameplay is great, weapons , creatures all fab. All in all a great game, with a little push it could have been outstanding but I still really recommend it."
"I just wondered how amazing this game is. very nice graphics and it's beautifully light. It runs smooth. Love the soundtrack, it really adds a post apocalyptic horrifying atmosphere to the game. The camera was the only thing that I wasn't completely happy with, I prefer a wider sight specially in a shooting game to be able to recognize my enemies sooner."
"I really enjoyed playing this game from Floor 1 to Floor 10. The overall design, graphics and sound are wonderful. However, the ""Respawn"" and ""Restart Floor"" buttons should be placed in different places to avoid accidental pressing of the ""Restart Floor"" instead of ""Respawn"" button. Alternatively, the ""Restart Floor"" might be replaced with ""Options"" so users can then choose whether to restart the floor or not. All in all, the game is amazing and I really enjoyed it. Kudos to the developers!"
"The best top down Alien Shooter (pun intended) mobile game experience I had in quite awhile. The controls are quite easy to master once you get the hang of it. Nice job to the devs! Edit: I was using a bluetooth controller when I made this review and going back to touch screen controls is really annoying indeed, lol. Please add us players a controls menu to remap/customize button placement, and an option to add a separate fire button instead of just drag to fire joystick."
"I didn't expect that this game will be so good. I like every part of this game, but some changes on the controls will do like having to option to keep the buttons fixed on a location as well us the camera rotation. other than that I really can't say. I just started the game. Let's see what other stuff you can offer. I'll leave a feedback once i finished the story mode. :) I hope that there are survivals and boss mode."
"I enjoy the game. The controls are different from other games, but once you get used to them the game gets easyer. The only most annoying thing is the camera that is not still and it has a button to reset. It would be helpful if the there would be a switch. Also on each level takes place in a closed space, a office or a lab, and there are a lot of things that get in the way of your movement or shooting. In order to get a high score, you need to kill the monsters fast."
This game is very creative. Graphics are great and controls are fine but the vision range is kinda poor. And you cant customize your character. The only way to change the look is to buy armors. It would be great if you could add character customization. Overall good game. Has a lot of potential.
Love the game in close to all aspects. I would however loved it more with a bit more darker tone in order to get across the feel of horror. The graphics isn't either the best I've seen on a mobile phone and could be improved further. Some kind of co-op would be amazing as well. Hopefully these things can be added to an possible sequal!
"I don't usually leave app and game reviews, but this game was a truly unique experience. The graphics - were truly amazing and there was a left 4 dead aesthetic to it The gameplay - was nice (aside from the repetitive level design), great controls with easy costumization and optimization Overall it was a really well put game which offers you a fun time and it's not over flowed with ads (which I truly appreciate) like some other games."
"Honestly it's a great mobile game to waste time on. Enjoyable gameplay that makes you crave the satisfaction of killing everything in the room in one go, creatively designed monsters although I'd like it better if the monsters have a larger variety, and most importantly, the game runs smooth and loads lightning quick but still has excellent graphics, the game is very user-friendly too. I highly recommend this game."
"One of the coolest games I've played all my years, I'm only using a tablet for this game! getting used to the function tho take time, experience for this game is smashing, time and effort has been paid off, graphics, music, sound effect, details, levels, creatures and much more. Thanks to the developers."
"Overall, great experience! At first, I struggled a little to get used to on-screen controls, but it's just a matter of practice. It's not that much of a struggle to collect credits by watching ads like it is on other games. Very cool graphics and short loading ng time, which makes this one a great game. Kudos to developers! Thank you!"
"Another console class game. I think this way as I played it so far. But it should have classic 3rd person view option and shooting and looking around should be seperated. I least they should give an option to player. And other than these, I think it doesn't have a story line. You're just having progress through missions. But gameplay is console class. Very quality game."
"An extremely fantastic game... Graphics are very sharp, with 60 FPS. Controls are good. Gameplay is fun & exciting. Weapon prices are reasonable, and it's easy to progress to the next level. There are also no annoying ads. And, it's definitely NOT a pay-to-win, freemium game. I'm just delighted, to have finally come across such an awesome game, well done!"
"It's a really great game, I've spent lot of time playing this game because it's so addicting! Everything is this game are great, the graphics, the gameplay, increased difficulty and challenging levels that makes this game needs a lot time to finish. But one thing thats so annoying for me is the camera view can't be adjusted/rotated manually, it's only auto-rotating following with the character's movements. Please make Xenowerk 2, but with storyline, missions and some RPG-ish things like character customization, XP leveling system, skill/power tree, weapon specializations or anything else, cause it would be awesome if those things are implemented to this kind of game."
"DEVS DEVS DEVS!!!!! Excellent game. Great controls and gameplay design is well thought through. Devs please augment the game to prevent it becominh a repetitive dungeon crawler! What you have here is top quality and it's being wasted! Room designs, level objectives and monsters need more variety. I would have liked to have seen more enhanced AI e.g. room to room map movement and swarm tactics from behind. Also I found it awkward to activate powers in a tight situation."
"Amazing game play, Although the player is a little far from you and you can't really feel the immersion but I tell you this game is awesome. The character is on point. There's a complain about the aiming (controls) The aiming is alongside the shooter button, amazing graphics though and amazing shadow effects and bullets and affect almost everything in gameplay"
"Xenowerk is the best mobile game, high quality graphics and the game loads in a split second, great sound effects and really cool weapons, I can't believe that this is a 3D graphics game and it works that fast and that smooth on my old phone, the developers really did great job in making this app so efficient in using mobile resources, all that plus there is no adds everywhere, just an option in the main menu that you can watch adds to increase credits if you want, this comes handy at somepoint."
Really cool game. I wish they could include in the option where in we could adjust the camera height so that we can actually have a wider view. Also if it would be easier to access the map by simply tapping on the map to get a clear view unlike opening the pause tab to access the map. Overall really great game 10/10
"Xenowerk is one of the first top-down shooters I've played and I've played thousands of other top-downs and I just don't think any of them equate to Xenowerk, individually and combined. Great weapons and weapon upgrade system, impressive suits and the maps aren't preset, cherry on top."
I loved this game. I downloaded it twice on 2 devices. Really good game with nice progression without spending money. It took ages for it to become a bit of a grind for the top weapons. An once you start getting good there are nice combos to achieve running a single root around maps slaughtering aliens. This makes it good to replay it through.
"For people complaining about aiming issues, here's a tip: Don't wait for enemies to come up close. When they become visible on the radar (top right), see if you can take them out from afar - just start firing away with your character's arrow (on the radar) pointing at the nearest enemy. Almost all the time, I shoot and kill enemies keeping my eyes fixed on the radar itself and ensuring my aim there. // The game itself is nigh-perfect, clearly made with passion, not a cash-grab and no forced ads."
This game is a fun and exciting action packed top down shooter with a doom like feel. I haven't started yet but I've played it before and got bored because there was only 1 mode. Please add survival mode where you play with other players try to survive and using power ups to our advantage. Add an infinite mode too where you survive against an endless wave of mutants. Oh and add more game modes that you can think of
"Usually when i play games like this i delete it after an hour or two but no, not this one. Very well made great graphics perfectly optimised for android. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves mobile games. Definitely add in some sort of online gameplay though. Would make the game so much better."
I've played through this once before and after u unlock everything the entertainment factor really decays after that point. But other than that I love games like this. It's hard to find something exactly like this and it's one of my favorites for sure. But a sequel or a more advanced version for this game is definitely due.
"I Freaking LOVE this game. I download games daily and then delete because I can never seem to find a game that I like enough to play.... until now, and I'm talking years. The graphics and amazing. Moves without a glitch. Im so glued to this game. SIDE NOTE.. only thing I'd like would be to be able to fully move button locations on screen."
"This game is great! I've made it pretty much to the end of two chapters, without even being prompted to purchase anything or being forced to by the difficulty in the game. Still challenging, but relatively what it should be- a fun game without strings attached."
I wish the levels had more diversity. You're basically doing the same level but backwards are starting from different points. Other than that you're probably gonna have fun playing this game.
"Just completed the first 10 floors and THIS is the kind of game I've been looking for, for ages. Its controls are spot on and easy to get to grips with. Its graphics are cool. It's fun and challenging but not frustrating in any way and the amount of weapons are insane! I look forward to completing it and for playing the second game :)"
"The graphics are beautiful, and I found they worked well even on lower end devices. The concept is significantly better than most games, and I find this to be impossibly good for an offline game. The gun upgrading is clever as well, and in-app purchases are minimal."
"Great overhead view shooter like most pixelbite games, I'm a huge fan of the space marshall series as well. The only minor gripe I have is that you can't pan the camera view in or out cause sometimes area of view is quite limited to see enemies, but other than that it's an excellent game."
This is a fast fun sci-fi shooter...if you're on-the-go in don't have a lot of time you can finish a level in a few minutes the colors are great and vibrant the action is fast-paced later on it would be nice to see some graphical or gameplay mechanics additions made but I think this is a great app that any fans of science fiction or shooters should try out
"The developers are very underrated, they clearly have a lot of talent and experience. The game is decent and very addictive. Graphics and gameplay are great. I also really like that the ads in this game are only 1 or 5 seconds long which I think should be the standard in all f2p games. The levels are quite repetitive though."
Very fun game. It has an arcade like shooter feel but with a story progressive element tied in. The controls are simple and easy to grasp. Weapon and armor upgrades come when needed and so far does not feel like there is going to be any level grind. Fun shooter game and one I'll be playing for a while.
This Game actually surprise me ! As shown in pics this game is actually like this (high graphics) & surprising thing is I am using a tab which has only 1.8gb of ram but this game doesn't lag single time! This game loading time also impress me it's level loading time is of only 0.9 sec at starting and now at almost ending it's time increase 1.2 sec to load in this type of phones Actually a nice game
"Lots of fun once you get used to the controls. You can aim your gun independent of the direction your walking. Once you figure this out it's fun shooting everything up. Make sure to keep amazing your guns and armor, the later levels definitely get harder."
"This game has a lot of potential, I'm looking forward to completing this game to it's full extent. DEVS you all have done your best putting together this master piece, so I thank you! My only concern with the game is the lag, it has its moments when it lags but it's not hurting the gameplay, I just think that the game would run more smoothly if there was no lag. The FPS setting, is extremely helpful. All in all I give the game and the DEVS a spot on thumbs up!! Thank you! Sincerely NightWolf."
"My previous devices could not play this game, but it's running perfectly on my hauwei Y5 lite & guess what!! It's amazing. I consider this as one of the best ever Android games on a smartphone. Action, different guns, one woman fighting thousands of monsters. Not so tough as what I first thought, when you manage your weapons. It could have been better, if you had 2 or 3 characters too choose from, but I'll still give it, 5 out of 5 & would have given it a 10 out of 5, if I could."
"This game is awesome cause I've been waiting for this kind of game I've been thinking like this since im playing broken dawn but weapons are worst in that game. But this is balanced in controls and ammo (unlimited ammo), cause its aim to hit the enemies. And leveling the weapons to make it stronger, hope the characters get leveled too. Make a new floors please."
"Incredible visuals! The view from which we play the game is freaking amazing, I've never seen that before. The game itself has many levels and upgrades both very useful for rushing your adrenaline and gaming experience. I love it especially the final level where it's all about time 😁"
Very enjoyable game. Okay mechanics and settings. Fun concept and lots of guns and different suits to grind for. Everything can be earned through play. Would recommend to anyone looking for an offline shooter!
"I absolutely love this game, I downloaded it like 3 years ago and it was still fun but the way of obtaining weapon's was kind of hard and required grinding. Now the game seemed to have been updated and now you obtain weapons with credits you earn from enemies instead of trying to get 3 radiation hazard medals every mission. Thanks for the optimization 👍👊"
Playing on a 5yr old Galaxy tab E. W/ Xbox one controller . Super smooth. Touch screen controls work great as well. Feels like a solid console game. I bought script to support devs. Grinding and watching ads seems to work fine for upgrades.
"One of the most impressive games i have seen on the playstore. Great graphics, gameplay and controls. Not pay to win at all. You can complete the entire game. Pity the devs hasn't updated it for the last two years. Its a game with great potential. Update it. Add more missions, add multiplayer elements and this will become a legend."
"Is one of the best offline games I have played so far with wonderful graphics and smooth game play although one thing I think must be in improved is the camera position is to close to the character and those not allow you to view enemys well you ony see them when they are about to kill you , so more on that an the game is perfect"
"Unlimited ammo and a license to kill are a combination that rarely goes wrong, and this is one of the best cases in point: a bug shooter with allusions to Metroid and Doom 3 that's compact enough to keep anyone hooked and give Sigma Team's Alien Shooter a run for their money. Nicely polished graphics and sound are the icing on the cake, with smoothness to beat many FPS and TPS titles up here that try to match the gameplay. If Doom was top-down rather than FPS, it just might look like this."
"whoa!!! one of the best games. please add something like multiplayer mode or just something similar and the game will be best BTW I got a trick through which I can buy anything in minutes. The trick is click on adds and press x button and you get 800 then after 5 secs you press add button, and press x again. repeat after 5 secs. do this for as much time as you require to buy best gear."
"Best Android game with controller. There are no annoying forced ads, which is great. you have the option of watching ads for additional credits, and that is the best case for any game. Touch controls are good, but I play with a Bluetooth controller and it feels really good. Keep up the good work!"
"This game so far has been great & I'm really glad 2 have found it, at least 4 myself it's been alot better than I thought. I'm usually not into these types of games I'm more of a car racing person but I tried this out just by chance & got hooked mainly because it doesn't seem very complicated & it's easy 2 get the hang of it. One of the best things about this game is that u can play the game & when you're killed u don't have 2 go thru ads & instead spend more quality time killing aliens"
"This game is pretty sweet! It's so much more than I would have expected from just a little Android game. The atmosphere, the gameplay, and the graphics are all top-notch and I have a great time playing it. It has a really cool Aliens (movie) and Alien Syndrome (game) vibe to it. I'm really glad I discovered it. Anyone looking for a fun, nice-looking, quick and easy to pick up game that you can play in short snippets as time permits should definitely check this out."
This game is good like some pc game. And it doesnt lag on my phone even if my phone is not powerful. Totally recommended to friends. One thing i want to suggest is the camera distance. Hope there is some option in settings that players can adjust their desired camera distance. Coz i want to see incoming aliens not just on the map. And i want to see them getting hit by my bullets rather than hitting them blindspot. It reduces the hype. Hope developers will work on it coz it is a nice suggestion.
"Its a good game if you ask me. Like other action games it has good graphics, physics, and so on. The only thing is that the controls are too density. Aiming is a real challenge. Pls work on this issue. This almost killed me in levels."
"I haven't had this much fun blasting enemies since Silent Bomber and Duke Nukem. Game is simple and fun. Control is not bad once you get used to it and the UI is simple and uncluttered. Ad is optional in this game, something which is unbelievable considering mobile gaming climate nowadays."
Playing with ipega controller at first I thought it was a bit repetitive but now I'm half way in i play it everyday. Great selection of weapons and great fun working out how to get the best kill streak in each area and pixelbite always make great games where u rewarded for not dying like space marshals. I love most this dev games back to reckless getaway. Which is no longer available on PlayStore but apk easy to find and instal online
"Very nice shoot em up. Over head isometric blaster. Can be played in short bursts, so perfect for those times when you need to pass time but don't want to be getting in to something too deep. Gorgeous graphics and great gameplay."
The games looks great and runs well on my phone. The ads are optional. If you like Dead Space you will like this game. There isn't really a story but it's fun. Love the alien designs.
"fun game, but power-up buttons are way too hard to click, really breaks your flow when you have to look away from enemies to carefully press the buttons. Space Marshalls 2 had the same problem with the bottom-screen buttons. Instead you guys should use bigger buttons at the top, out of the way but easy to press"
"1.PLEASE, A little locking on enemies !! a little auto aim. 2.The camera moves a lot. it better be behind the player most of the times. 3. WISH the keymapping ability was an actual keymapping ability, so we can shange keys. Generally the GRAPHICS and GAMEPLAY are GREAT !! but controls can get better and the ""best part is its simplicity"" & supporting controlers. the game is simple ,enjoyable, easy to play and fair. but it can get boring after a while.PLZ ADD MORE STUFF like quests & pvp mode."
"Good game love the gameplay it's smooth the level is getting harder and harder you need to farm for more credits lots of map to unlock, good graphics, no problems on the controls, and if there's a problem I'll soon give a comment for it, but it's actually really hard to get credits idk the strategy yet but I'll soon find our a way :p"
"Super fun. Easy to play. I downloaded this to play on a long plane ride and found it to be one of the most enjoyable games I have now. It's a bit repetitive, but that does not detract from the fun. Could easily waste hours on this without regret. It's not P2W at all, but I bought some credits to support the developer. Of the many games I've tried, this one won't be deleted."
"Game has good controls, runs flawlessly on my low-end phone. Gameplay is fun, and best of all, there is only one currency, which you can get enough of via gameplay and optional ads. No ""gems"" that you can only get by paying, just satisfying progression."
"I played a lot of crappy apps and a lot of good apps but I've never played a good app they kept going so well, there doesn't seem to be any hooks or any games other than having to watch videos, of which there's plenty of extra upgrade coins to be had, and only one type of coin no funny business. extremely recommended 4 time burning blood pumping alien killing action."
"Amazing. This is one of the best games on the app store animation - wise, the graphics the controls everything. The graphics aren't ps4 level but it's got it's own charm and style. And the animations for everything are just superb. I love this game."
It's my favorite game so far on mobile. Can't stop playing because it's fun! The first levels are boring but it reminds me of Doom after a while. It's so satisfying to kill all those monsters! The graphics can become impressive when there's a lot of the action but you gotta choose it in the settings.
"Exceptional gaming with a gamepad. And this very cool and free game. Thanks again!!! Game Developers for this one. We want more cool games like this one 1 in the playstore. Going forward into 2021 and beyond. Pure dedicated free games(no loot boxes, & in app purchases or none of that madness). With full blown controller support. No more on screen controls only please!!! On your future projects or your competition."
"This is such an AMAZING game!! The graphics are good and the gameplay and content is out of this world. This is a great game. Would rate 10 stars of possible. Absolutely must download. Also, you have an unlimited supply of money of watch ads quickly. I actually love pausing the game because the map is so ckear and useful. Couldn't be happier 👌"
"Badass!! I've been playing this game and the development team really did a good job. Scary, but after a while it does get repetitive. Im sure anyone who likes this game is looking forward to a part two that takes place in a similar environment but has grenades and a slightly richer story line. Ty"
Super fun. Challenging but you feel like you have a chance to have some fun with it. The music is good and the gameplay is smooth...so far...hahhaa. All in all seems well engineered to be a great time killer. Accurate trigger work is really hard at first but you get the hang of it eventually.
"Such a great game. Graphics: 5/5 gorgeous Ads: 7/5 NOT.A.SINGLE.AD! Yup that's wierdly rare. There's ads there but you chose to view them or not, for which you get coins as rewards. Soo good! Controls: 4/5 pretty simple Replayability: 3/5 might be a bit repetitive Simple but hugely enjoyable, highly recommend."
Was about to delete it...but after figuring out how to control the character it became addicting...Being able to continue where you left off makes it a lot more enjoyable without the frustration of going back to the beginning...Great game..Thanks!!
I would've downloaded this game the first time I seen it if I knew nothing else it was succh an excellent game. Can even connect your device to your PS4 or XBOX controller for seamless controls. Being able to preview the weapons with short video clip before purchase would be a very welcomed feature.
"Wonderful!!! Love the gameplay, the environment and the controls are even better using a Bluetooth controller I'm using ps4 remote. And I also found a loophole to getting unlimited free money there's a loop in the ads for free money, watch as many videos as possible to get better upgrades so the game will be a breeze!! Lol 💯 thanks devs great game"
"One of the best gameplay experience. Suggestion: i want enemies take a lot of bullet and dont die soon, enemy's less speed approach, and more enemies are approaching at the same time and i have to focus on aiming at enemies to kill them all, they dont die soon, dont approach quick. *enemies dont die soon *enemies are huge in number *most of the enemies movement, are less than me"
Overall a really fun game and it looks AMAZING!!! Runs at 60fps on my phone and on highest graphics setting. I can't believe how good this game looks. Gameplay is great to! My only complaints are game wants access to my photos and the controls that suck.
"❤️❤️❤️❤️This is the first game I am rating. I am really impressed with this game because: 1) the graphics are extremely good, the game runs really smooth in 2GB RAM phone also. 2) the sound quality is superb , and on headphones it is 8d quality. 3) I haven't found any lag or bug in this game till now. 4) the loading time takes 4 to 5 seconds.5) the camera view is awesome. Not just these but there are more good things about this game.not a single ad. I really recommend this game. ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"It's a game where you don't have to pay out your wallet. You can easily wait for packs to be discounted to where a gold and weapon pack combo be around $5. Why spend it? It will eliminate ads and basically you won't need to buy another pack again, unless you want gold stuff which might float your classy side (did it for revolvers, and they still own after 15 level ups). Overall the game has some interesting twists for game modes, you might wind up running around killing zombies, or manning a turret and flying around doings so. They also brought back some events. The controls is the tricky part, it gets glitchy where you may move or not at times. Which can really be irritating because later in game, you get swarmed if you stay still, or get ripped a new one by the bosses. I hope they fix the movements soon. So if you don't mind plinking a few dollars to get ad free and whatever else you want to survive an onslaught of zombies. This is a game for you."
"Wonderful first-person-shooter! Top-notch graphics if your phone can handle it, if not, they are adjustable. One of a kind & creative items and gameplay, focused around chickens! One key feature worth noting is that due to phone gameplay for shooters being limited to your 2 thumbs (usually), you do not have to push a button to fire your weapon. Special items, health and grenades require the push of an on-screen button, but primary weapon fire occurs when your cross hairs are on an enemy."
"Been playing for a couple days and I got to say, this game is VERY underrated in my opinion. Graphics look really good for a mobile game, controls easy to understand, missions are great and just....wow. But I have a couple things that I could be better. Like switching characters, don't know if u have to be a certain level or whatever but I wish I could go out and kill Z's as a medic or whatever. I wish I didn't have to play in 1st person (camera). Overall pretty good, would totally recommend."
"This is by far one of(if not) the best mobile zombie game. Maps are really well done, graphics are great, the campaign is perfect and the characters alright. The only suggestion I have is for the boosts to be collectable instead of automatically applied. Other than that, the weapons are aweeesommmeee[animations good, stats, etc] gameplay pretty dang immersive, items useful and great. If you read this far.. you are cool!"
"Excellent game great graphics, but I'm uninstalling because I found it very difficult to control the avatar. The movements are so fast I found it hard to get through doors down stairs. I kept getting stuck! I will give that issue on myself. I had zombies after me, I may have panicked a little. Awesome game. Maybe better for the younger gamers."
"I though most zombie games were a fierce dozen, I was wrong. The graphics are console quality, I like the fact that there is a story involved which makes the game more intriguing, and I like the GPS type guide in the boards si you can't get lost which is easy to to in FPS games. I am really enjoying playing this game and I would definitely recommend it for players who like FPS or RPG games."
"Best zombie fps out there! This is a great game to play whether you have a mobile controller or just want to play with the touch screen. Super smooth Graphics and lots of weapons to choose from, but the flat character and b-rated storyline leaves much to be desired. Wont dock point here, just look up any gameplay A note to new players: ads are really annoying! you will need to spend $3 on the intro pack in order to progress while in the game, but it's easy to get gold with tapjoy. Loveit!"
"Been playing since 2014. This game improves every year. New maps, new weapons, better response time, better pixels(depending on your phone)and new challenges. It's probably one of the best first person shooter games out there for phones. You can connect a game console controller which is pretty neat(not necessary if you ask me but still cool addition)worth the download but uses a lot of space(low GB phones and/or older phones won't have as good of a time. Lower pixels and longer lag time)enjoy!"
I've played hundreds of games and without a doubt this is the best game. You could spend money but it's not necessary. Graphics are really top notch and missions are really great. Upgrade times are reasonable. Lots of side missions that pay well. Game controls are a little touchy but overall an incredible experience. Definitely worth the download.
"This is by far the best zombie game ever for mobile. The controls are easy to handle, the game is not complicated, and it's pretty easy to level up if you grind the missions. Even the consumer service is amazing, they helped me with my login issues, within 12 hours. Dead Trigger 1 was really good, and Dead Trigger 2 was amazingly breathtaking, Great job team on making an amazing game!"
"this is the bomb when it comes to first person zombie shooters. Good blood and sound effects, autofire for less fuss, and a large collection of realistic weapons that are satisfying to use. It is a pretty challenging game at first, but level up and you'll soon be playing on hard mode like me. (I'm level 38) The story is decent but what really separates DT2 from the glut of other zombie games is the graphics. they are asphalt 8-9 level pretty. 5/5"
"I have yet to make any purchases, had it a month or so now. But, this is one AWESOME zombie killing game!!! The weapons just keep getting better and better. And although those living dead coming after you from around every corner, under those nooks and crannies keep getting faster and meaner, it just keeps me more hooked on the game. I'll be playing this one for a very long time! Bad to the zombie bone!!!"
Very good game but it has a problem when playing. In trying to shoot the zombies from far it want then they spit on you and kill you. Spit goes very far from them And trying to shoot the barrel to blow up the Radiation zombies It wont target the barrel far off to explode. But other than that I love it a lot and it is very hard to play on hard mode. They keep killing me lol great game still give it 5 stars and the graphics are breath taking. Good work you guys...
It's a great game but it needs more campaign for every country. I would like a open world map for each country where we can find blueprints and items without looking for them in the missions. Having a open world map for each country would be fun and immersive and maybe the graphics could use some upgrading since it's been a couple years now.
"Edit: Turns out my new controller is literally the absolute worst, the game is perfectly fine. ---- old review --- This game really doesn't like real controllers. It takes the ""look around"" options literally, like old Doom before it could use a real mouse. Binding controls to a joystick ""left"" ""right"" and all that? You can only look, up down left right, there's no inbetween. Like using wasd on a computer to look around"
"I first played this on an iPod touch 5th gen, then a Galaxy S6 Active, now on an HP Chromebook. The experience is phenomenal on all 3 devices. This is a truly prefected mobile zombie shooter in my personal opinion. There are plenty of options to get free gold if you aren't a pay to play type of person. The controls and combat dynamics are smooth. The graphics are gorgeous. I haven't ever been bombarded with ads in years of playing it. 5/5 would reccomend."
"Ngl i started this game with the thought in mind to hate it, but no matter how hard i try i can't. It's hilarious in itself and even though the protagonist has the vocabulary of a parrot and NOTHING is explained, it's satisfying. The wrench that you start out with is literally better than any other weapon in the game. The sniper has bullets that allow you to change their path. It's great. Only minor problem is the controls seem a lil bit clunky."
"Very Awesome Game! Best FPS zombie game out there! Still! This is Call of Duty zombies on steroids! It has been over a year since I've played this game. I just re-download it, to see if you guys have added anything new. I cannot express I am absolutely amazed and impressed on all the new things you guys have added to the game, the graphics are still Kick-Ass, and you can still move freely around."
Amazing control system! I really like not having to tap my phone screen a million times for every trigger pull. Good zombie story. Really good short missions with a good amount of variety. It doesn't feel like the same exact mission over and over. I'll be posting this game a ton.
"New to gaming, other than old school stuff. Many are just too complex for me. I am really enjoying this one, having easy play modes, and user friendly aim and shoot, or sing zombie upside the head. Oddly satisfying, fun great graphics.. finally one that I can play and advance in, while getting better as I go! Thanks guys, rocked it."
"Just started playing, on level 20 and I love it!! Not to to hard, very addictive and exciting!! You can pick your own missions to make money, in other words, you can always pick one your good at!! The only thing that makes it go slow are the upgrades, little ones takes minutes big ones take hours!! Really enjoyable!!"
"This game is awesome, I love everything about it, but I have one question: Do you guys plan on finishing the game, I keep upgrading my Technician and unlocking new territories but there are no new missions. Did you run out of ideas? Is there a top boss zombie? Why did you stop progress on the missions? I enjoy the tournaments and the arena, and all the side missions... Please respond, thanks."
"I searched for games where I can kill zombies and to be honest, this one is the best of its kind: - Variety in the missions you want to do - not just recycled worldbuilding like others - the developers really understand their players. You don't need to buy everything. You can have much progress on your own with the free tier. But their generosity makes you want to buy stuff just to support them."
"Best zombie slaying game for mobile. I like the graphics and the gun sounds the most,but sometimes after completing a mission the game freezes at loading screen and it's frustrating. Everything else's good. Best mobile game I've ever played."
This is by far my favorite game I don't know what the people who are giving negative reviews are playing but this game is soooo realistic its awesome only thing is I've done all the missions in story mode and I don't know when I will be able to get further on the map . Please let me know if there will be more. BTW the graphics are fantastic.
"One of the best shooter games on Android. I thought the first release was good enough until I downloaded this one and I haven't regretted it up till now. Nice graphics, amazing gameplay and for once this is a game that makes it easy for players to go around with the money from missions unlike some other ones I've played. Although I don't really like the new arena in this version. You guys made it look like some kind of sport. The first was better. Regardless I'd recommend this game anytime."
"Good zombie shooting game. No in-game purchases are necessary if you are willing to grind through the side missions and wait. However, purchasing a few weapons does relieve a lot of frustration."
"Great game, this is my fav zombie game and tried lots of them. The only issue I have with it is the text constantly popping right in the middle of the screen, blinding you, I mean what the actual f?"
I love this game a lot because I have played this a long time.This game has a very clean interface and controls are really easy.The physics of the game is very realistic.You can blow up any part of the zombie with a shotgun.That's adictive and very fun to me.Its also fun to kill bosses and gather blueprints.I love this game and hope MADFINGER team will work to improve the game more for us.
"I Can Finally Play this game after 5 years! Man, I can't wait for me and my dad to compete, Thank you!! Edit: HI! I would like to report a bug, every time I complete a mission, the loading screen would freeze and I would have to restart the game and lose my progress, I hope the devs will be able to find time to fix this, Thank you in advance."
I love this game. It brings back tons of memories from days when gaming was simple. The biggest issue is repetitive content and lack of newer features. It's still a good game to play for most users.
"so fun!!! love the different things you can do here, it's not too annoyingl hard and graphic is amazing! love it! i want to play with my friends but why is it so hard to find any information on how to do this???? pls reply! thank u"
"My game is gone 😭. My achievements, weapons, and chickens. please help. my achievements is 60/86 but won't open! Please help. 😭"
I play a lot of games but this is one of my favourite games beacause the world that has been created and the level of difficulty that has been given is amazing
The reason why I love this game so much because it has like barely any ads and you get weapons easier And and it's just very fun so yeah that's all I love about this game.
Topnotch graphics...best gameplay....good story mode. And best of all a very helpful support team. Keep up the good work guys!
"The graphics is not perfect but is still sweet,the missions are well designed and fun it kills time and I am sure you will enjoy as much or more than I did."
"Lots of, cool graphics yes there are ads but what games for free don't come with ads. You're playing awesome games for free make all of the games you can buy stuff if you want the cool stuff or play till you earn"
Ok this game is really good the graphics is really good the gold scar 50$ is a lot of money for a thing that save you 2 minutes I say make it like 15/20$ just saying really good I recommend this for a zombie game it nice not bad no ads for me I don't know if there was to my notice
Excellent game and the mictransactions are optional and it is not indirectly required to progress the next missions.
I give full star because this is the only one best zombie survive game i played in my life I give one negative that is you have add the jumb button anyway this game is perfect for Android devices the graphic is so good and the originality is so good
It's the best zombie game I've ever played ... u should Totally download this game .. The Graphic are amazing .. every day when am at work or boring at work i always play this game .. ✌✌✌
I truly love this game since 2014. It's good to see new campaign to other regions. And create new content for this game(maybe co-op🤔). Keep up
Wooooow this is fun the best zombie games ever that I ever play and also it's too easy to collect money and gold and the tournament level is great wooow this is super cool I love this game and i give it 5 stars because this game is nice
"I keep getting stucked at loading screen after completing a mission, it's so annoying when I have to restart the game & it didn't save my progress. Please fix it. *Edit*: Thank you so much for the new update, the problem is fixed now. 😊"
"Awesome! I use to play the original version with my tablet and PS controller. This is just as good, maybe better. There are no advertising, only if you want free gold. Way better than many other games always spending half the time looking at ads."
"Good game, but try and update more frequently, such as adding new events or new wepons or even adding a feature where you can craft your own weapon"
"So so much better than the first game. Levels don't repeat that obviously, great campaign, better controlls... Truly a proof that the devs are listening to critique! Only downside is that I have to have internet to play single player. I am not a bot btw... Really guys, you can be a little proud of yourself. I'm curious now about more mad finger games. Thanks a lot. I still prefer gaming on a PC but this is good for mobile!"
"This is a amazing game..... This is my first time to play this game, and i am so happy because it has a story mode 🤩. In my opinion, this game is worth it especially for those who are interested in zombie world🧟🌏"
After completing a level the game just got freeze for infinite time and does not load back the progress. You have to let down all the progress and and start again on same level. Upgradation time and money is also very long and high maker just want to keep this app in your phone as they want to sneak in your data for a long time
"Game is amazing, had a sound issue in the beginning but the devs helped me fix the issues. 10/10 game."
"👍👍👍👍👍 !! Addictive & crazy good - love the concept*soooo many diff games/levels/warfare-missions LOVING THIS GAME HEAPS (it's all I do in my spare time,to escape reality basically!) 🧟 🥰"
Overall the game is the best zombie shooting survival on mobile but for some reason I'm stuck on Russia I just unlocked it but there is no missions to play and I don't know why please help me 😭
This is a great game. Pretty long campaign with a decent story. Lots of weapons and missions. Only bad thing is it takes so long to upgrade your crew. Besides that it is a solid great game.
"Nice game with good graphics. I like it. If you like zombies games, I recommend this one you."
"Great game, awesome graphics, smooth running app, levels are good and challenging. I would like to give credit to all those involved with this games development and creation."
"Played for years, happily. Terrific graphics and background sounds."
"I love this game, I've played it ever since I was a kid. It's fun and I love the weapons and upgrading options. It's rewarding and engaging, this game will always have a special place in my heart"
"Truly the best on mobile. I came back to this game many times growing up and I'm well into adulthood and I cannot stress enough, there's no game that can do it better. This is a solid CLASSIC that still outshines a lot of mobile games to me."
This dead trigger game is the best game for android i like it so much even the graphics feature properly made main you all need to play this game.
It's not absolutely packed with adds and the game is fun. Graphics are decent and runs smoothly. As far as free to play games go this one respects you're time compared to others.
The graphics are just great! And the background sounds are just mind-blowing!!
I never have been able to watch any movies about the walking dead. That is not until I learned to slaughter the walking dead on mad fingers deadtrigger2 where I rule the dead and well what can I say I owe it all to mad fingers Dead trigger 2. Thanks guys. Here it is a year later and I still feel the same. Thanks. MF DT2
This is one of those Rare fun games you can enjoy for a while while you're bored I would recommend playing it at least once
Game is great I love it!!! Great way to pass the time and it's best zombie games ever
I'm a huge fan of shooters especially fps and dead trigger 2 has been my favorite for a couple of years or close to it. Its just the best shooter out there in my opinion. If I were in charge of minor kids I wouldn't want to see them playing this. But I love it😁
I love this game as I'm playing since my childhood but there are still some bugs that I would love to see that should be solved like damage something get too much low.But anyways I've never seen such a zombie game with such intense and it gives me old vibes.
Good game Graphica are also soooo much realistic I love this game all people should try this game once only 504 mb so low with super high graphics There is nothing bad in this game
"Very fun game... if you have a gamepad or controller mod for your phone, it's even better.. I play Xbox One and ps4 a lot.. but this game is perfect if you are on the go... give it a try.. you won't regret it."
"ISSUE: Thanks for bringing back the power/ supply run mission and probably seek and destroy mission (haven't found one yet). But why on earth would you make the ironsight permanent?? I get it, some people prefer more accuracy, but you should've given the users an option to hide it or at least customize the layout. Because right now it is placed in an awkward position (unintentionally activating the ironsight several times). Ironsight covers the whole screen and while it's active, the player seems to move slowly. Kindly fix these issues."
"Really AWESOME game. Controls are easy to get the hang of, graphics are beautiful and the gameplay missions are designed to be simple but challenging. My only problem is that blueprints, in my opinion, are not frequent enough so getting new weapons is a bit hard. Maybe make it so every 5 missions a player does (not sentinel) a blueprint will be given no matter what. Other than that, amazing game 😀"
"The game is amazing, a bit buggy, graphics is smooth for a 2013 game and remains one of the best shooting games in the mobile platform. The only thing I want to point out is when you complete the campaign, it becomes into a grinding game upgrading and having to replay the game a lot of times to gain money. Money given is very little, prices in producing weapons are high and blueprints drop rate is low. Either way, highly reccomended for a good mobile shooting game."
"Really well made game that you can play on a pinch, love the non stamina system and the amazing combat feel you get. It does get a bit repetitive though with the lack of content sometimes but for what it's there, this game is worth for occasional carnage once a while. Again combat feels fluid and good once you get used to it. So far that's the only thing I have to say."
This game is my love😩 graphics are pretty cool realistic and very nice 😚❤️🤭I'll rated 5 star❤️ pretty good game of zombie 😩the first part I don't think so I like it but this second one is fire 🔥💥✨
Good game and fantastic work ..#I am also a game developer I am learning game development l am also trying to make zombie shooting game
This game is a very good combat game without any glitches or bugs I really like it it's a good game after all
"Amazing game. One of the best zombie shooting game ever played. It has amazing controls, stunning graphics and unbelievable storylines. It is the best zombie game I have ever played. One downfall is there. This game needs a network connection to play. It would have been good if it was offline just like dead trigger 1. But the graphics, the gameplay, the controls are stunning. A must download game and must play game in the playstore. Good job"
Great!! 🔥🔥 But it seems south America campaign is the last stop. Kinda disappointed ☹️
"The best zombie shooter game in android hands down! Very good graphics, you can customize the controls, varieties of zombies, different types of challenges, a lot of weapons and locations. But no game is perfect, there are always some negative sides like zombies get stronger easily, blueprints of items and weapons does not drop frequently. Warning, hard is literally hard lol. You must master Dead trigger 1 before proceeding to this game. This game is really challenging. Extend the campaign too."
"The game acknowledges the limits of mobile gaming when it comes to shooters and centers its difficulty managing huge swarms of zombies in order to remain challenging despite automatically shooting enemies. My only complaint is that the story mode is a little bit short, but aside from that this game is incredible."
"Great game. Well thought. Keeps you coming back for some more action. Creaps you out sometimes, which great for a zombie killing game. But I only have one issue which is recent and that is now I can't watch any videos(ads) to pick up some gold or rewards. Before there was plenty, now really. Please fix that, if its bug developers."
I've experienced a very annoying bug . The game freezes on loading screen after completing a campaign mission and I'm left with only option to close and restart it .The rewards from the mission after all the hard work is not available either lol . Otherwise a great game .Hope it gets fixed . Edit : The issue exists no more . Thanks MFG : )
Omgggg just omggg it's really awesome I love it and the graphics are cool!!!!make it pc varsion.
"The game is amazing, I like the movement, however there is a sound bug that makes a weird sound after the pop up appears at the beginning and after that the game is unplayable because the sound comes out delayed, but the gameplay isn't affected nor the speed of movement. The sound keeps crashing after multiple attempts of restarting, uninstalling the game, deleting cache, checking sound, lowered performance to smallest you do that on the settings, still nothing, appreciate your feedback please"
"overall a nice game with cool graphics , need to add some more missions to make it more interesting. There is only one story line and the game just end . Need to add some more stories then it will be very nice .you need to put an option which help us to activate our boosters according to our convenience.plzz , fix this issue . it is a nice time killer and addictive."
"It's a very good game, I've played it before and I'm pretty sure there wasn't any waiting times for missions, this just makes the game harder for everyone to play so I think they should get rid of the 20 minute wait timer."
One of the pest games that I played in mobile it can also compare to other pc zombie games!! And it's good for low end device! But one thing more updates
"This game is very nice especially because of the manual button changer, 4 stars because map is hard to operate and some minor bugs."
"The greatest fps shooting zombie games ive been playing this games since 2018 but there is some technical issue every game i finish the gets frozen i hope you fix this,good game though madfinger"
I want new dead trigger 3 but like old but good game old . But need good too real and good gun and fun kill zombie but too old is 100% is good old one I love old but I want see real new dead trigger 3
"I have played this game multiple times and the only issue I've faced is the fact that it takes too much time to get to the next level. The game is almost perfect and the story line is amazing. But from what I've heard around, many gamers like if there's a flow. The Loadout base totally kills the momentum by making us wait for a long time and not to mention the level waiting time. This is what many successful devs have used (FROM SOFTWARE). Other than this one issue, I love your games. 🥰🥰"
"Give this game a go!!!!!! I'm absolutely loving this game so far. I like the fact you can choose easy, med or hard and after completing level go back and play again harder to make some extra money. the adverts are minimal and haven't been a problem to me. it's keeping me interested which is not easy, I unistal a lot of games because of boredom, I don't think this will be one of them. Storyline is good without dragging. Hopefully the game will continue how it's started. Good Luck killing the Z'S"
"Excellent game. Really fun. The controls are smooth. The gameplay, albeit straightforward, is engaging. Everything works. However, the long upgrade times are annoying. And they are really long. We're talking about days, and later on weeks till an item or a category gets upgraded in game. Other than that, a really good game."
i was the first one to play thiss game in my family and now all of them r playing it the game is so good and it deserves 5 stairs for now ive been a og for 2 yrs and also played the first dead trigger and i rly like them and i like fingergames
I find it absolutely amazing it's honestly a great mobile game no lags no adds its amazing!
Fun game and it's fun to play the sniper missions are perfect.
Enjoying the gameplay and story. Like the leveling up and variety of weapons
Really fun game I like how they have challenges when your wating for the next level to load
Phenomenal action game i downloaded it again can't miss all the action and headshots
I miss black ops zombies but this is the closest zombie game I found to it there is
"Had this game before awhile back, and it's still just as good. I'm not sure if it's been updated recently or was just as good, but it does feel fresher and the graphics and animations for a mobile game are surprisingly good. Very simple concept, but it is kind of scary the first few runs. The game isn't super hard, but I die a lot from my dumb mistakes, of which will quickly punish you. Game is still as good as always, personally I still think this is better than the second."
"This game is simple but very fun and still has enough to do to keep the player busy for a while and isnt super grindy and the stuff you do have to buy is not necessary to have a good time but even so I think they are worth it because I personally think they are pretty good small purchases. The game doesn't force you to watch ads and there's no ""energy"" where you have to spend money to keep playing or watch ads to get said ""energy"". Graphics and atmosphere is amazing definitely recommend:)"
"I did uninstall this game, but that was for storage issues, this game is great. I tried the second one, but still came back to this, I prefer the graphics and endless run. Occasionally, at least once a play session the game just gives me unlimited ammo/gas. Not that I'm complaining, sometimes it's nice to just put the chainsaw down and chew threw hundreds of zombies. And if I ever wanted limited ammo I could just restart the game. So in terms of bugs, I kinda like this one. Either way, good job"
"Been playing this app for years. Fun and engaging, with a multitude of gamemodes, weapon choices, etc. Ads aren't an issue for me here, as there aren't a whole lot. Additionally, you have the option to watch one ad to multiplt your reward (in-game coins) which can be used to buy power-ups. Gameplay is addiciting, game runs smooth and has superb graphics for a mobile game."
"Into the Dead is a fun running game where you dodge or kill zombies to survive (main part of the game). It's annoying that you have to buy the upgrade version of your weapon, but they let you try them out once a day or as many times as you want in Trial of the Dead within a distance of kilometers or an amount of zombies you kill. It's a great game! Also, it's easy to get all achievements. It just takes about a month if you play every day ro get them all."
"I love this game. Challenging and helps eat up time. I like that you can change the controls so you get a different experience...aaand sometimes I go a bit too hard on the tilt in public hahaha the ads can be a bit exhausting though, not gonna lie. They're sooo long and difficult to escape without clicking more than occasionally."
"This is a must-have mobile game. It might even be the best survival game in the Google Play Store. Even though Into the Dead's graphics aren't topnotch, the gameplay definitely makes up for it... and the creators and developers made an intuitive way to play the game. It's also really easy to get the hang of it, but I guess it gets repetitive after awhile."
"Endless running, along with action,adventure with a little spice of horror in it. Heh, amazing combination. I've had this game in the past, and recently redownloaded it, i love how they made a really good game even better. It runs smooth, there a lot of content, and diffrent controls for everyone favroite way to move. - but i would consider making it a way to use a controller or gamepad in the game? Otherwise reccomend for people into this kinda ""racking up level and sets"" kind of thing."
"Love the game yeah it's the same thing over and over but if u have even one other person and u challenge em it's endless fun plus it has modes events challenges and quests so you have a goal and have to do things a certain amount of times to give u direction. I use tilt, the tapping zones an joy stick are a bit broken and the tap zone kinda sucks. But tilt works great and u can tilt a little or a lot and control how much plus make faster manuvers"
Played this game since I was a kid. Never really changed. Although now that I look at it. It should have more weapons. More of a goal you know? It's a great game both graphic and gameplay wise. Does take more of a powerful device to run it. But its because of how the grapics are set. And they look beautiful. Great Game overall!
"This is a great game. I've been playing many hours and I'm still enjoying it. There's a lot of fresh content, challenges every day. Cool weapons, gnarly zombies, what's not to like!? And... the ads are optional! Other Developers take note: if you force me to watch ads, I'll stop playing your game. If like these guys you give me a choice and reward me, I'll watch ads!!"
"It was always a good game and still is, especially since it got a remaster now it looks amazing too, although there are two problems.First one is after a ad plays the sound of the game just stops working for some reason so I have to restart it so that it works again and this happens every single time,second is that some animations after the remaster are messed up like the one for the cartel twins, but those don't effect the gameplay that much so it's still 5stars"
"Immersive and Addictive. Into the Dead features endless possible playtime, with increasing challenges the longer you stay alive. With the simplest of objectives: survive as long as you can, you'll be faced with intense scenarios that require split-second decisions which will either grant you a few more meters or lead you to your death. Easy to pick up, difficult to master. Requires quick eye-hand coordination and hours of gameplay experience. I've never faced zombies in an endless runner before."
"This game is really good, it has different kinds of controls that you can choose. And I like that, since other games just makes you use one kind of control, and you still need to learn to get used to it, but this one has many. Aside from that, the animation or effects are also really really good and kinda realistic. Recommended to download."
"Love it... eversince i first got a hold of it, ages ago. Keep up the good work. One thing though, some armaments like those with the telescopic gun sight are blocking the sight of the right field of view. You could hardly see the obstacles (zombies, tree's) on the right side of the screen due to the telescopic gunsight. The grenade explosion could be enhanced further though, to give it a more realistic booming explosion, and other armaments included. Thanks and Godbless😊😊😊"
"This will always,in my opinion,be the best zombie game ever made. There is nothing cooler than running for your life through a field of hyper realistic zombies with an assortment of insane weapons and charming dogs. It also has an amazing atmosphere and sound effects,so that's great too. And the biggest bonus by far is that it is absolutely not ""pay to win"",which is REALLY great. Trust me,this game is next level amounts of awesome."
Definitely 5 stars. The grafics are amazing and the option of controls are useful and easy to use. This game is also good for not giving you that many ads which means the game play isn't ruined by stupid free mobile games popping up on the screen. I don't have any problems with this game and it couldn't get any better. I definitely recommend this. You should play it.
"Like a horror movie, first one is always the best. The only achievement I didn't get was play the game every day for a month because it was kinda repetitive and I lost interest but when I played it, it was great. Sometimes annoying not reaching a crate of weapons by not been able to go far enough left/right, maybe should of speeded up that a bit but was still fun to play while it lasted."
"I really quite like this game, you could watch loads of ads and spend money, but at the same time you can spend nothing the game is well designed and simple it's definitely one of the five best mobile games I've played. Only problem is, it keeps telling me to download into the dead 2 and when I try to it says 'item not available'"
Well I've finally come back to the genre of murdering mindless killing machines and I'm brought back with a smile. ITD (Into The Dead) is one of my all time favorite run n shoot games on my list as it has anything a gamer could ask for... The gameplay is bone chilling and using firearms makes you feel in a sense that you're in control.. Love it to bits and keep up with the stuff man. Really appreciate your work...
"The updated version was incredible... It kept me wanting to play even more! The church, the smoke arising in the forest and from the crates, crows and the colored zombies once they captured you. A CAMP FIRE or BONFIRE would be a great add on to the next update on FLASHLIGHT or any mode, roaming rabbits and a bear would be terrific! WW2 zombie pack should be purchaseable, American football be place in FB instead! God bless you all!"
Amazing Game as Always... But I have a problem with the crows not showing up sometimes. They just fly all the way left/right where I can't even see them. Not saying it's when foggy. So I think that's a lil bug.. over all I love this game!!! So it's a 5* ♥️
"This is an easy to play and exhilarating game. Definitely one for the Zombie fanatics. Would even be fun for the Horror Genre Fans. Then for the standard gamers that like a good challenge. This has something for everybody. Lots of in game purchases not overpriced or if that's not your thing they even have a progressive and fun way to earn perks and weapons easily. Most items can be obtained simply watching a video and who knows, might even like the item advertised. Also it's offline too"
"This game is easy to pick up and get good at. The wide selection of of weapons, the first person point of view, the setting, it makes it's a super fun infinite runner. I have thought of restarting from scratch many times just to start over with all the fun."
"Better than into the dead 2. It's just a free roam zombie dodging game that you can get weapons from completing mission sets instead of getting new weapons in the levels. The one thing I don't like about it it's that you half to get the weapons you unlocked in crates every 400 some meters instead of in into the dead 2, you can equip the weapons you have unlocked in the lobby before the level. But anyways, it's a great game and I hope into the dead 3 will be good too."
"Good game. I love the it, especially the fact that you have to avoid running into the zombies. Most games would make you run away from the zombies but this game is unique, it makes you run towards the zombies and you have to try to avoid them. I love the little extras you can have. The companion, gun crates, ammo crates and a starter gun are really helpful and it makes the game more fun."
"This game never gets old. I started playing this game about six years ago and it just keeps getting better. Every time I get a new phone, this is one of the first apps I download!! A great way to pass the time with no bugs or crashes.I would say the only issue is how many ads there are. But pikpok makes sure they're short and provid a lot of benefit to the game you're playing. Great job, developer team. Thank you for the awesome game.❤👍"
"Y'all should update this game more. Itll be really great if this game had more to it. Like, add new and different weapons. Add more to the intro, and kinda brighten up the environment.... it's dark and gloomy but in the second its badass and perfect. And the intro can have some more detail to it, like him blinking and seeing two walkers about to dig into him and he pushes and kicks them off and gets up and runs. That'll add more attention to the game and make it more attractive. Itll be awesome."
Into the dead was amazing and I love zombie survival games but this was better I could actually move around and kill at the same time while I play the objectives fairly so there is no way to outsmart anyone with your score! I still havent reached my destination to the radio tower if there even is a destination there. If you can please get back to me developers please tell me if im wasting my time wasting my time trying to find the radio tower but for now FIVE STARS☆☆☆☆☆
"This was an awesome game. Though this game is free. This game has 26 achievements to do, after that achievements keep coming but upto 26 is main. Then we can unlock dogs, zombie packs and so on. I have achieved all the 14 achievements of the game, and have been in top 1 percent in total killings and total distance. The ads to recieve coins are well balanced and not too much ad watching is required to progress:) Looking forward to play the second game soon !"
"this game iz very adicting! i love it! but when i started to run i noticed something in the background. theres a radio tower and i tried my best to get to it. but it seemes that nobody can. and plus, theres not much backstory to it. i mean, i guess from what i can tell. you crash on a helicopter you survive SOMEHOW. and you start to panic.and you go on an endless journy of running, dodging zombiez intll you get eaten. i mean thatz it. other than that i love it! just add some backstory please?"
"gave it 5 stars because there wasn't an option of 4.8 stars . The game is amazing but the only silly and annoying thing is its pause menu . After pausing when u resume the game it starts suddenly without a countdown of 3 , which can let u in danger , hope this little mistake will be fixed in future , LOVE THIS GAME !!!"
"Good graphics. Pretty good gameplay. Simple and easy controls. Now, are there any bad things? Yep. Those damn cornfields...once you see one you will be hellalot scared not being able to see. More baddies? Weapon selection. In the classic, its actually harder than hardcore, as the weapons avaible range from pathetic to super duper op. While in hardcore you prelect your weaponry, making it easier to mow down hordes with those bling weapons. Flashlight mode also is very nice. Recommended? Yes!"
"It's not really a story mode game if that's what you're looking for. However I will say, compared to it's sequel, this game is a bit more difficult. Dodging zombies after a certain distance is nigh on impossible, and God help you if you get in a cornfield unarmed. I wish more weapons were available by in-game cash instead of actual money."
"I like the way this game has been represented. An endless running game with wide screen mode. Moreover graphics are realistic enough to hold you for a long time in the game. And all this in just a 80 mb game. Wow! Really loved it. Keep up the good work,makers."
"Really good game, I liket he controls and the leaderboards are a nice touch. It's always good to have a little competition. And you can get all the perks for free for just watching a 30 second ad. would highly recommend to friends."
"This game is very awesome!! It gives you chills as you travel deeper into the woods, knowing that death is inevitable. Even though you pass a few waves of yellow eyed hungry zombies,the search for a weapon is so stressful because now u have to juke a dozen zombies to get 1 weapon crate! To also understand is that once you play it,you really don't wanna stop."
Its a really nice game iv been playing these game since a long time its a crazy vibe maker and its satifing... I say u try it too I just edited my review why can't I play it like before man i want tilt not the controller not everyone owns a controller..!!! Bring back the tilt!! Bring back the tilt!!!! Bring back the tilt...!! PLEASE 🙏
The game is always fun but does need a co-op/multiplayer and pvp mode added onto the game with massive updates making more animals as well as planes and other fun ways to get around from the zombies. Add more screams and animation of blood and terror. Also have a chance for a revive from a teammate around the world.
It's definitely something that is different from other mobile games I've played.. Here u can see yourself in the first POV running away from zombies. You're not aiming to kill them all. You're just trying to survive. Also very nice graphic and sounds good job developers!
"Wow, first time I played this game was when I had a struggling game mobile.phone and it made me so frustrated not playing the game will full playability. Everything was bad from the lag and slowdowns I get because my cp was pushing its limits. But now, oh boy I finally experienced the greatness of this game played with a full gaming cp! This has got to be the best zombie shooter for me! And for others I say!"
"It is one of the first zombie shooting game I had started playing with. I remember, back in my childhood days, I enjoyed this game so much that I kept playing it on and on😉. The ambience has been neatly set in a fierce and scary zombie apocalyptic environment with only one aim: kill or be killed. The graphics are incredible as compared to the recent games. That is why it deserves 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, nothing less than that. If u haven't played it yet, plz give it a try and u will surely love it💖."
"As a old game its still doing well and healthly but i play into the dead two more but still play this for memerioes. But the only problem is getting hit by a tree or zombie leads you to die because you fall and cant move that fast which leads to you getting killed, Which in into the dead 2 you dont falling or anything you just get nuged and you get back up. You guys dont need to fix that but im just saying that its a trash thing to run into i think it fine the same way it was years ago."
This is a really good game it Is single player and can be offline one wierd mechanic in the game is when you run into a tree or the side of the zombies you move left/right quicker but the screen goes wobbly. This is a hard game but I still rate a five star for the difficulty.
This game is a true classic that deserves more recognition. A fast paced endless runner combined with a zombie infection first person shooter is a match made in heaven. Complete with a wide variety of weapons. I just wish it was possible to earn all of the paid advanced guns with gold instead of real world money being the only way.
"This is actually a funer game than your 2nd version. It give you 3 different options to control your guy and the object of the game is pretty much the same as most platformer games, get as far forward as you possibly can but the graphics on this game are pretty cool looking and the fog sence Is dead on. Lol"
It's perfect! It's so fun i stress sometimes but the quality is so good! It's so good!! i readed an post it said there was to many ads. No there's not many ads one at start of the game (It's no video actaully) one when u want +1000 coins and one when u want all perks and +600 coins(maybe when u die idk). So basically there's no many ads.
"Great survival game. The graphics, sound and gameplay are extraordinary. The thing is that this game gets repetitive after a while. I wish the is some kind of ""ending"" after a few kms of run"
"If this game was my girlfriend, it would be a love hate relationship. Love the run and gun aspect, but some of the weapons suck. Main the beginner ones(except the shotgun) I hate getting a those weapons out of a box after having a good one. Once I've made it so far keep me going with the good guns. I guess there in lies the challenge. Ok I said enough. Love the game and keep up the good work. PS, Love you too beautiful."
"This game gave me nightmares.😂😂 However, really good game. Loved it. The running through zombie part is a little unique than other zombie survival games. The most satisfying thing is when the dog jumps off. Keep it up. Good work. Everyone should give this game a try."
"Classic mode makes this a great game that isn't intrusive and pay to play. Without a classic mode that you can just run whenever you want, the second one is just a pay to play money trap full of pop up pocket book grabbing attempts."
"I'm in that much excitement to play the game. Just download and enjoy. This one is really worth for 110 mb. Let me conclude my review and rush back to the game. To the developers, if I was running into the dead like this, I will never loose a gun. I mean, can't we keep at least 3 weapons while running..? While taking coming weapon creates, throwing a machine gun for pistol doesn't mean any logic."
"The game is very beautiful! The graphics, the controls, everything is great. But something I wanted to be in the game is moving in different directions and changing seasons: spring, summer, fall, winter. But again it is my favorite game! Thank you for this game you created! This is the best game I've played!"
"I think it's a good game, there is, sadly, mirotransactions, but it's not a pay to win game, because you don't NEED every gun in the shop, only things like a pistol or shotgun (wich you unlock) are really needed, especially at 2,00 meters, were stuff gets REALLY intense."
"This is the best ever. It really puts you on edge:D I really recommend it. Especially to those who wants time to fly fast. To those who read comments I recommend playing the zombie soundtrack from the movie""28 days later"" while playing this awesome game for best experience:) To the developers, I really thank you for the appreciation towards poor gamers like myself by making this offline and cheap in terms of storage. thank you TT"
"ONE OF THE BEST GAMES THAT I HAD EVER PLAYED ON MOBILE. I mean, who doesn't like zombies, fast paced gameplay, and rewards? The controls on my Pixel 3a were phonemnal, but I got a game holder which increased gameplay TENFOLD, courtesy of Bytech. I'm gonna spam play this game before I move onto the second installment. All in all, this is a Go-To game for me, and it shows that you do zombie right."
"It's nice ,the game background music and the sound of closing of doors makes the game more realistic and the sound of every weapon during a run is also has its separate attribute.Apart from all of these the game must have the more guns to buy at low cost to play from the beginning without perk using."
"Great game, one thing though!! The starter pack is a rip off, the crossbow costs $1, the grenade launcher costs $3, the cartel twin upgrade costs $5, total that's $9 but the starter pack containing JUST these 3 is $10, a full $1 more than the 3 items seperated"
"This is probably one of the best games I have ever played. It is very addictive and I would not change a thing about it, mostly because there is a second game with story mode. within the first 24 hours of playing it, I got the RHINO 91A a very OP gun in the game. overall, I recommend this game to everyone who likes a crazy fun experience and like zombies."
Out of the thousands of games out there for the mobile this game will always be my favorite one. I for one don't normally leave reviews on the games I play/played but how can I not. Easy controls. Awesome missions. Awesome graphics. Great variety of weapons to use. I could go on with how much I love this game but I'll leave it at what I wrote. To people who read my review I highly recommend this game. 100/100 Great job PikPok 🤘🤘
"I played this thing for like a couple months now, I uninstall it because of some few storage problems in my phone but now I miss the thrill this thing gives. The atmospheric vibe, The bloody horror vibes when playing this. This is the only app I think that give me some kind of additictivity to play more..."
"I love the into the dead best game. Ww2 zombies by second world war: 1. I like the ww2 Nazi zombies I like the unitfrom on them looks perfect fit into them the problem is it needs more infantry division zombies more fit in to by 1939 to 1945 fit more ww2 maps more fit to different ww2 zombies like The Axis powers (Germany, Italy, Japan) were opposed by the Allied Powers (led by Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union). And new ww2 weapons more that every people interest fit:)"
"I absolutely love this game! I'm surprised that it hasn't been mentioned in Game Informer. Thank you pikpok for an amazing game. Also, I'm considering writing a story for this game (not the second one, though. You guy's already covered that.) To those who are reading this, if you like zombies and heart pounding horror, and intense action, I highly recommend that you give this free game a shot. Enjoy!"
The game is excellent and I like this game a lot last year. This year it has updated with one control options which is it kinda hard to play. My friend IOS user still these options available but not for Android. Couldn you please consider bring control options back how it used to... Thanks ☺️☺️😊
"I downloaded Into the Dead and it was totally worth it!This videogame(like other Zombie Shooters)has objectives.After you complete MS 20,you get 3 other modes.The graphics are so simplistic yet so realistic.You have tons of weapons to unlock.It is challenging and fun.You can also choose how you control the person so that it fits you.(4 control types). You have Trial of the Dead for if you want to challenge yourself.Overall,I am not playing the sequel.I will still play Into the Dead!"
"I love this game so much, too sad that they don't update it anymore, hope they could still focus on this hame despite having a part 2, I loved this one more than the new one cause this is just simple and fun arcade like, the other one has too much graphics to take and the zombies here are much scarier looking, the ones from part 2 just moves scary cause they can walk up to you"
"An amazing game! Just amazing! I would only recomend to the devs. to pls add more weapons and zombie types to buy or just add to the current weapons that cost real money that you can buy with in-game coins, same with dogs... With types of zombies, pls add more of them.... Love the gamemodes, just also pls add that wave gamemode thats in VR cuz its too fun! All in all the game is amazing! LOVE IT!"
It's a great game with many missions. Exciting and thrilling. Also available offline. I play it in the bus and it certainly kills time in an entertaining manner.
Their must be an story mode gameplay like into the dead 2 and developer must add more guns and we have trouble to upgrade our guns because if we want to upgrade our guns we have to spend money and its not possible for everyone. Else game is perfect.
I've played hundreds of games in similar genre and none of them is anything near this beautiful game I've first installed it about 7 years ago and I love playing it still after ao many times! Thank you devs for this unforgettable piece of art! I just wish they wouldn't have forgotten rhis one and added new set of guns every now and then.
I really like the game and there are great sound effects. I've enjoyed the dogs and the gun aim. I would like it if we could upgrade with coins but it's fine. I recommend this game to help pass time and you could just play it for fun. I'm addicted.
"Weapons in this apocalyptic game are realistic, some weapons run out of ammo quickly because they are just picked up, how the hell could you get a full ammo during the run in reality? I also love the turning anf jump physics it looks so reaaal Man! This is scaryyyy 5/5"
"Words can't describe how this awesome game is, classic control, addictive Best graphics, best guns , challenging levels, the list goes on and on and on and on. THE GAME is....... just WOW!!!! Good job guys keep up."
"I really like this game that you avoid the zombie this very realistic that I ever seen of zombie games out there that unnecessary to consume your bullets or your weapos durability to just survive to the zombie and its have stunning graphics, particles of blood makes it gore. I really recommend this game."
I mean I like the game but it's hard to describe also I live in like the middle of nowhere and it's hard to get good reception and data and service in Internet and right now we're using like one of those little tiny Wi-Fi boxes like my 5 from like those my internet boxes from Verizon and all that was really tiny ones that you have to set up and all and you're able to block people from the internet and it's just really hard downloading games cuz usually takes a long time so make the game smaller
absolutely fantastic game that doesnt beat you over the head with purchases. simple but addictive in a good way. a bit too many ads between games but they gotta make money somehow.
"Fantastic game, insane graphics and realistic sounds, and it really fills alot of empty time.The only problem is that there are not alot of free items and it will get kinda boring if you dont spend money in the game, I request the game to kindly add more free items"
"One of my favorite mobile games. And I love how it's one of the older games and it's compatible with controllers and somehow the ""pay to win"" aspect is not really pay to win it's more akin to daily DLC opportunities this game has aged like a fine wine."
"The graphics are amazing, no lie. I can't believe that this is under a gigabyte. Anyway, the gameplay is fun and has the flare of killing tons of time easily."
"This game had everything good in it. It has good graphics, gameplay, modes, and gun gameplay but it lacks story line, you should make story in this just like in ITD2 it'll be really good and pretty attractive."
"Now words enough to say about this game. In my lifetime i never see an android game like this. This game is fully offline. Thrilling gameplay, Awesome graphics, Best challenging game ever. I like this game much. Some games steals more storage and data but they do not gave a good game. Through offline this game had more detailings. This is my honest review. Everyone should try this game."
"Played this game when I was a kid, thought to reinstall it and I am just glad to say that I love it , when I was a kid and now too , don't change the game , let it be like this only , I am feeling nostalgic right now, just one opinion , can u pls just let us buy dogs and new weapons which come in different updates(Or I think so) should be bought with in-game money and not with real money and new guns should be added after the minigun like for an instance , a rpg , otherwise no problem.☺️"
"The game is fairly easy to play, graphics and sound quality is beautiful and immersive. It's a zombie based endless running game with good gaming mechanics and easy controls, it's great."
"Im playing this game everyday. Ive been playing it for years though. The graphics is so intense and I love the new gamemodes. And also the guns but, can you add a companion like a jaguar or cheetah. It would be more fun in that."
"because the last time I must have played this game was two years ago. two years later, I got a hot 7 and then I saw the sequel to this. this is about the best part. wait for it. the moment I switched on WiFi just now, I found all my progress from the last installment. and since the game was intense then, it has evolved. man these guns. what did you do to these GUNz?!!!"
Overall it's a nice game! But sometimes the gun comes in the way of the running i can't seem to see the path to run and boom the zombies eat me. It happened many times.
An amazing game I love playing this game I'll see one of the first game to ever got whenever I got a phone think it would be some dumb game but it turns out to be one of my favorites definitely much better than into the Dead 2 because it's pretty much pay to play inside into the Dead 2 it's not really that fun but I enjoyed this one
"Great game, I had it a while ago and recently downloaded it again. The graphics are great, controls are easy. It's just a fun great game. Also love the companions :-)"
I like the game so much....i played it for years...but there is a glitch with my new device...it automatically detects control scheme as a gamepad...and the touches in games are not working...my device is redmi note 8 pro...hope the developers solved the problem.
"I've been playing this game for years even before it was popular and it's always been a favorite of mine honestly I dont find any bugs with it, it dosnt have a fon of ads like most new games, and its enjoyable. I've never liked in app purchases but they have to make money some how so I cant complain🤷🏼‍♀️"
The game is awesome as it is very small in size and also with amazing graphics but the problem is the crates which are sometimes not able to get because of less sensitivity please fix this guys otherwise the game is perfect for time passing
"It's a great game, really good time eater and fun most games just choose one and time eaters are usually boring but this is exiting and gives you a reason to go further personally as a kid I thought the glowing tower was the end you get closer to it and it's always there tell me it's true I spent years trying to get there"
"I absolutely love this game! Solid infinite runner game play. HOWEVER, I recently redownload the game and the game defaulted to controller input making the game unplayable for me. Please help for a fix!"
This game is awsome there are little to no ads during gameplay and no glitch what so ever I haven't discovered any bugs either. The graphics are great and I love the dogs and their runs so much thank for the experience.
"This game is great, light and easy to play! My only wish is to make all weapons usable, becouse, upgradin' from eg. Spas 12 to another shotgun kinda sucks...Purchasing another weapon is ok, but simply ""abandoning"" previous is very strange."
Love this game! It runs real well on my phone. I love the variaty of different challenges and the weapons as well but just need to make it so the zombies aren't bunched together so I can't get through
"The nostalgia is reall coming back to this game, haven't played it in years but it's just as much of a masterpiece now. Not many ads, great graphics, thrilling gameplay and lots of fun weapons."
"Great graphics, great optimization and just great fun, although I think the controls could be better, it is not bad but they could be faster.I think this game is a great zombie runner."
The game may be hard it is just it's fun it's just fun but still they need to work on the difficulty though like you can be a beginner and you can have the most trouble on one stage it's like hell but you'll get used to it like anybody else will get used to it I'm starting to get used to it I only got this game like yesterday so or last week I'm not sure I kind of forgot
"One of the greatest,best,wonderful game in zombies under offline.I love this game😊😍 ,becaz excellent missions are classic,Hardware, tarch light mission, different survive dogs,zombies,weapons,& graphics. Main one problem is weapons are temporary not have throughout mission.. weapons are not open in modes why?? 😏😏.."
"Amazing, I love it. I played it for around 12 years, however I hate that the devs are trying to make it impossible to get free add-ons on console & once they succeed, it will ruin my Minecraft zombie chaos world that has up to 1000 things in which are items, food, monsters, accessories, buildings, armor, weapons, ores, tools, new potions & blocks, towns, shops, etc that have different duration but are the same as the vanilla potions in terms of effect.z :(. It's sad the world with break soon."
"I give this game a 5 star. To be honest, there's quite a lot of bugs, which I will mention a few annoying ones, but other than that, fantastic game play! Most annoying bugs include: sprint jumping 5 times in a row or more will stack up and give you fall damage, some players heads glitch sideways during online play, and when teleporting during online play I have to leave and rejoin due to lag. I can play around these bugs, but they need fixed before others experience this."
"Minecraft is a blocky sandbox game that gives you full control of how you play. You can survive, build, fight monsters, explore, and play on servers. There are infinite things to do, so the game doesn't get boring. My only complaint is that the game always has bugs after every update, and most take a while to fix. One of the most annoying ""bugs"" that has been around for a long time is that the texture of stripped spruce logs are much darker than they should be. Overall, it's a good game."
"Good game. Most complaints are just misunderstandings. You can change almost everything complained about in settings. I have never had a single problem. Also, just a tip, leaving ideas in the reviews usually doesn't get them noticed. There is a minecraft feedback website that might get ur idea attention. (If it is a good idea!) I totally recommend it. It is a great game, and totally worth $7.99."
"Soo... This game is great. Graphics are good, gameplay is smooth, all that stuff. Maybe could you make a way to get coins other than money? I just use apps, but it really takes its toll on space. Also, people have been having problems where one person has been in, and the other gets kicked out. The answer: delete a few apps to make room for the playing experience to work. Or, you need to allow them to join in settings. Maybe add a few more mobs in, like a tiger. I'm out of writing room. Wow. Bye"
"It's awesome I love it, there are somethings though that I would liked changed. I wish we had hardcore worlds. Tried installing apps for it but it always disables achievements (Wich is boring). Also being able to build on the nether roof like in java. Lastly being able to use trap doors to swim. But I doubt you guys look at the reveiws so whatever, tough luck"
"Favorite game! So impressive how well it plays on mobile. But! When im using the joystick mode and have more than 1 potion effects, the potion badges and the jump button overlap, causing the potion effects screen to pop up when i mean to jump. I'm currently typing this while in the nether waiting for my potions to wear off so I can escape ghasts. Thanks"
"I love this game, I honestly do, I miss the old version of stuff but thats okay! I found out a way to fix the d-pad and controls, I seen some1 have an issue about that, Go to settings, Touch; from there go to Where it shows what type of touch pad you want. It would allow you to preview it. Please check that. :) Thats for ppl who where having issues with the d-pad and cursor! Then adjust the controls to your liking <3. I love this game sm, it allows diff types of things for controls!<3"
"I like it! During the past 3 years of actually playing this game it has really grown on me, not only is it about finishing your recent build in creative mode, fighting the ender dragon, or just having fun with friends, but rather all these things! You can pretty much do anything in this game, the possibilities are endless!!"
"best game ever :D I love everything about it, but there are some things i want to be added: i really want to be able to switch versions to previous updates and stuff sense we can do that on java edition. also i wish i was able to see my friends list from the menu. i have to load up one of my worlds just to see my friends list and who is online. but other than that, this is the best game in the universe 🤩🤩"
"For people who need to change the new controls: Go to settings, to controls, and there should be a setting to change it back to the old controls. You'll have 3 diff options, so change it to whatever you'd like I love the game, but I'd really love to have shaders back as it added a sense of realism to the game. Unfortunately shaders were removed because of the New render dragon thing, but I hope it'll be fixed soon. :)"
"Always has been a great game, though the Marketplace is... Not impressive, for what it's worth. I wouldn't suggest buying unless you know what you are getting into. The control change has been a unpleasant surprise, but anyone can change it back to what it originally was in their settings, so not much complaint except for the fact they made the new controls default, throwing off a lot of the older players like myself. Other than that, 👍"
"A relaxing game, it doesn't really matter what you do because you can do almost anything. You can build houses, or be a nomad. It's a little bit laggy on realms and servers, I would like that fixed. Lots of replayability since the world's are randomly generated. You can play alone or multiplayer which is also nice for when you're feeling lonely. Overall, 8/10 I would definitely recommend. The controls aren't good ever since the update but at least you can change them."
"Just had error recently, was fixed and now had 19 worlds in smooth mode. They even had a license error. The most important part is the conflicts of the game. I use the commands almost every day. Then the scary part. I got lost in a different dimension today while I was getting to the overworld, then far away from my builds. The last part is the early glitches. They fixed it. 👍🙏"
"It is amazing but when I made this giant castle base it was gone when I rejoined the same world, I looked everywhere on my map and I checked the whole map but it wasn't there. I think it's a glitch or bug because I didn't Uninstal it at all, so it's so confusing but good thing I took a pic of it so I could rebuild😮‍💨 IT was a relief, but it's such a good game I give it 5 stars but if someone could fix or help me please do. Overall it's a awesome game😋😁❣️I love it!!! :P :) ^>^ *^*"
"There's a lot of work that needs to be done, such as fixing shader support, easier access to files and guides to fixing api and what actually changed. Other than that I've had a few rare crashes, but all in all a good game. You guys should add more capes or make it a bit easier to make custom in game capes."
"I love this game and I see some people find the joystick bad but some people may love it but to the people who don't know, you can change that in video settings. I love how you have a choice between 3 layouts of it. I love all the new mobs, block, plants, and textures. It makes the game very fun and it let's you be creative in many ways."
Regardless whether you play on PC console or pocket edition it all feels the same there's not really a difference and between the 3. Just If you decide to primarily play Minecraft on mobile I would recommend investing in a wireless controller. If of course your device supports it. I have an xbox series as controller and it works just fine I use it with a lot of other games on my phone too.
"This game is very epic, it works amazing for mobile, and I haven't seen any recent bugs so far. The only thing i want for this game is to customize the control layout, or something like it. but other than that, I recommend people playing this beautiful game if they're in a mood for survival, and of course..... adventure :)"
"I left it for some times and it improves a lot. It's a great game now. Also there is more contents to explore. It's fun. But I have two suggestion for this game. First, add copper armor and weapon/equipment, and make the ore only appears one when it being mined so it will be fair. Second, please allow the analog to be placed anywhere to fit the preference of the player."
"It's a very relaxing game when playing with friends, but can i report something? The item frames are not working anymore idk whether it's a bug or something but it's been pretty long enough for not fixing it. When i tried to put on the chest with the item frames on it, it just couldn't work, so i hope Microsoft fix it cause it's really annoying and difficult to remember where the things we have put in it"
"minecraft is one of the best games out there and for all those people wondering, you just need to go to settings-touch settings, and change the control scheme to any of the three options. this does include the original d-pad and touch control, as well as buttons and crosshair options. i think the only downside to minecraft is that it is getting larger in size every year and that causes more lag. but other than that, it is the best game EVER!"
"Minecraft is an incredibly creative and addictive game that offers endless possibilities for players to explore and create. From building incredible structures to surviving in harsh environments, there's always something new and exciting to discover. I love the blocky graphics and the ability to customize my character and surroundings to my liking. The game's multiplayer mode also allows for some great cooperative play and friendly competition."
"Minecraft is one of the most versatile and exciting games out there, since the first time I played it, I felt the passion behind the programmers. The sensation of danger when exploring is very fun. Since the introduction of the Warden the game became more mysterious, also the creepy ambient of the Deep dark Biome is very exciting. The game has also inspired me to make my own models and textures to customize my game experience. I highly recommend this game to everyone. Can't wait for 1.20! : )"
"Honestly the game is as you'd expect , it's a casual yet intense game where you can either play peacefully and just discover what the game offers or go through the game and play on 3 different difficulties an make the gameplay more intense and get the real feel of advancing through the game. There is only one issue which bothers me the most , the game is AWESOME however I really really wanted a texture pack to make the game feel real , and I mean a HD and amazing render which it doesn't have."
"I enjoy playing this game but I've run into a few annoying things in mobile. In the settings for controls, you can turn off vibration when mining a block when using Keyboard & mouse but the controller doesn't have the option to turn off vibrate when breaking a block. Also when going through my inventory using a controller it just resets my cursor to a slot a lot. My phone starts to heat up when I play. I put my graphics settings as low as possible expect for I put fps to 60. I use a SG Note 8."
"Amazing game, a way to express your creativity. Although, on my device I don't have any photos or anything, minecraft still takes a really long time to load and it is getting annoying. I'd also like away to play on past updates, I tried and cannot find a way to change it in settings."
"This is the best game I've ever played. I've been playing it across many devices since I was 7-8 years old (around 6 years) and It's absolutely incredible. It's got something for everyone. If you like a challenge or survival games, you can play survival. If you are a creative person or you like art, you can just play creative and build whatever you want. I have obviously experienced many bugs with this game, but they don't take away from the experience too much. 100000% would recommend."
"Bugs magnified by not thought trough design choices, to the 80s level of software crazy (if anyone remember) - one star for that retro feel, second and third since it is still minecraft and very patient and deditaced person may likely still enjoy it. EDIT: 32bit was 3/5 (due to above) but after switching to 64bit version most issues are gone making it a good contender for 5/5 game (especially since mouse & keyboard as well as gamepad support are available)"
"Its a great game. I've played it for years now and made so many great memories with this game. This game lets your imagination run wild in creative and if you feel alittle challenging you can play survival mode. The difficulty of the game goes from Easy to Hard making mobs in the game more stronger depending on the difficulty you play in. Edit: The new update ruined the creative controls, like it takes even longer that normal to break a block... In Creative Mode! Please fix it.."
"Um idk what to say. Smooth performance. After the 1.19 patch released i didnt have any issues with connecting to servers. I usually play on a Java-Bedrock crossplay server and had no issues whatsoever. I can put whatever texture pack i want and still runs as smooth as vanilla. And about the controls. If you dont like them, just go out and buy a bluetooth controller, its way better that way."
"Nothing to complain about this game it was fun and full of challenges along the way but one thing for sure could we actually see the durability of weapons without using mods on mobile phone because sometimes I play in my phone with my friends in school,it would be great to actually see how much durability my equipment has.Thats all thank you."
I love this game I play it all the time!! But there are some bugs.Minecraft has been glitching and the market place is not working I have full internet connection and restart the tablet im on and the app and it doesn't work.Please try to fix that! Other than those bugs it's a great app! Great Job Creating It!👏🫶👍
I love building things and I love getting to play with my friends. I love the realm. You get to invite your friends or family in it and if for any reason you need to kick someone from it you can. I also love the realm because if your friends or family are offline you can still play and get a headstart while waiting for them to join you. I love survival mode in my opinion its more fun then playing creative mode. You get to do challenges in survival mode where in creative you can't.
"I can certainly tell you why I love Minecraft. Minecraft is a game that allows players to explore, create, and imagine to their heart's content. With endless possibilities for building and crafting, it's a game that never gets old. I love the ability to start with nothing and create my own world, shaping it to my own vision. There's a certain thrill to discovering new resources and figuring out how to use them to create something amazing."
"This game is very awsome, its a place for all ages to use their imagination in a world of blocks and very cool excessive stuff. I'd really like to see ducks involved like white and normal colors and that and also be tamed, but I'd also like to see other new creatures in the future like breaded dragons, more colors for tamed wolves, a lot more tamable creatures like new added ones and foxs and more."
"Can you add two different options 1st option is to switch between pocket edition, bedrock, and vanilla versions of the game for mobile. The 2nd is if you can add a function that tells you for each chat command you type it shows you what they do and how to use it. Anyways it's one of the best game of all time. I want to say thank you Mojang your game was what made my life have something to wake up to and put my creativity into you are the one of the best companys I know. Have a creative day:)"
"I've bought Minecraft on more systems than any other game. It's a great way to be creative, relax, and unwind. It can also be fun, adventuresome even a bit unnerving at times! It's whatever you make it, but whatever you make it... it's a solid good time. 👍"
"It's a great game, I've played it since way before the aquatic update (on PS3, and Xbox 360), there are a lot of bugs/glitches, the UI could be bigger (like some people mentioned), please make the UI bigger."
"Been playing this since 2021, and I gotta be real over here. The team over Mojang is doing a SPLENDID job on.. None other than Minecraft! It's been an absolute blast and wonderful journey from where it first started. When I got pocket edition, I thought it was just Bedrock. But it's kind of a 50/50 of Java and Bedrock, but the main point: is it worth it? Well, I recommend trying the trial first. But if you're reading this, this won't disappoint at all. BUY IT.. Now!"
"Minecraft. No introduction necessary really. 😀 The Android version is glorious. I've been playing for a long time and the phone version has come a long way since it was on the Xperia Play. I ❤️ it, my kids ❤️ it, even my grandparents ❤️ it. The multiple ways to play, the procedurally generated landscapes and online play give this huge replayability. Wonderful software. 👍"
This app deserves more than 5 stars. It teaches creativity and how to survive in the wild. Theres to things I don't like. One all the good things cost alot of minecoins and second there needs to be more ores that can be armor. Also I don't like how you can only add either protection fire protection blast protection or projectile protection. And the game takes up too much space.buy overall its been my favorite game for 7 years.
"Extremely fun, can't play enough but even with my s21 and the lowest settings my phone gets warm and the battery icon flashes when charging and playing, stopping the charge though still letting me play without losing. Aitosave is incredibly annoying but you can copy your world before the risky move, accidents are only good when you plan them and also don't mess up in your original world in the first place, seriously just battery issue though, high settings burns my fingers. Thank you hihy"
"Minecraft is a great game, a classic. Tip if you are going to buy texture packs, if you experience game crashes just go into the packs setting and turn down the resolution."
"I like it because it doesn't make a single lag.Sometimes I go crazy and spawn a lot of zombies and I don't think I want to do that again because it is a bad idea it made a massive lag. Then, it crashed so, I do not recommend that. But, I give it a 5 stars. In the future can you make it more realistic?I think more people will like it and make the shop free, like everything in it."
I LOVE MINECRAFT. So much .with the only current downside being it sometimes won't update. I've been playing all my life. I practically have at least. But the only thing I wish they could change is to make updating not require to update in internal storage. Because I only have 32GB in this phone. And I have an SD card that I have moves minecraft onto. But I have to delete everything everytime to get the update to download. Because it has to go into internal storage back to external.
"I love this game ever since i was a child and i have read the people that rated Minecraft. And i think that some of there problem is about the bete and people who can't make a solution. For example, Minecraft could not be installed, the simple mistake for others is that they have minecraft that they installed for free in there phone or just something else, next is the controls, they probably don't know how to change it, and i think that the bugs is only in beta. That is all and i hope you luck."
"Awsome game. Wish you didn't have to pay to get the premium but it's still a cool game by itself but I think it should be updated more, but still a pretty legit game. I also wish you didn't have to use money (in game/fake money) to further customize your avatar! But needless to say I still think it's a cool game and an awesome experience. It would be nice if it tagged what you use to mod it somewhere but I have no other regards. 10/10 Mojang! 👍"
"What an amazing game, I mean out of this world! So much different things you can do and tasks you must complete all by yourself, or with a friend. It is just great! I like how realistic it is, with mining, eating, being injured, raising farm animals, it is just a really fun and is something to do!"
"So... I am a bit behind on this one but the new controls are pretty annoying but we are still getting used to them,and there were 3 options: 1. The original controls, 2. The joystick, and last but not least.... the tap screen I chose the joystick, and it is very unique."
"This must be the best game that have ever existed! I love it, especially when added with mods that I had downloaded. This game makes us creative in building and more. This is one of the editors choice for a reason. Once again, I love it and I hope that this game will never be removed on play store. ♡"
"I love building on this game and exploring and finding new things that I haven't seen yet (I love to play this very much). Whenever I go to download random stuff, I have to update it even if I already did yesterday. But I love it, it cures my boredom when I got nothing to do.its like the best thanks for reading"
"An amazing game to play when bored. You can find your ""Goldylocks"" in the settings for the worlds. It's amazing reading all these reviews, people mad but not realizing it's a simple thing like updating the game, or simply not knowing about creative mode. Very humourous. I congratulate you creators for getting so far, and branching out into side projects and making them blossom. Thank you Creators for making something humanity can call nostalgic yet current."
"This is the best game I have ever played. It's very versatile and can be enjoyed by anyone. If you like combat, you can fight, if you like building, you can do that, if you like exploring, you can do that, etc. This game just gets better over time and the updates are always great."
"Honestly, this is an amazing game, amazing soundtrack,songs,fandom,builds,ect. But one problem I've been having lately is with skindex, no it's not skindexs problem when I say this since I've tried other ways to use more custom skins but, when i go to import a custom skin from anything, now its saying ""Thats not a skin silly!"" And all the apps were working about a month ago but not anymore??? But the even more strange thing is that, the old skins I've downloaded from skindex still work???"
Still holds its title as one of the greatest games ever. the controls are hard to get at first but you get it over time and with playing around with the controls settings. It makes up for it a bit by going cross platform (bedrock edition)
"I want to have a harder game like peaceful there are so little mobs so little it is almost unplayable as you can't get resources you need and they instead add little mobs but does little damage and also make a server to teach redstone,xp farms and strategies to kill mobs. If you guys are seeing it, I hope you guys could take consideration and try adding my opinions. And if it too hard to add then nevermind but thank you for seeing this message I will ask my friends to play too and tipping."
"LOVE THE GAME. But for some reason I logged onto my friends world and it didn't save my inventory. Anyways, we got a ton of diamonds when we played. But my tablet died and when I logged back on, it saved my OLD inventory which wasnt very good. It was quite sad, but it's alright because most of the diamonds went to my friend anyways. But if the game updated frequently even while playing, it would be much appreciated."
"A really nostalgic game and very relaxing! This game has a special place in my childhood and I guarantee your money is really worth it in this game. You basically just build or play in survival, it's basically just a relaxing sandbox game! I really recommend it if you haven't played or heard about this game yet, and trust me it's really worth your time and money."
"The game is smoothly set out on what you create with blocks. The realism in this game is very true, finding blocks and crafting blocks are both the real life elements. The two modes are easy to understand and build with, except the limited blocks in Survival. Creative is an excellent starter mode as well because it can simply give new players a look into the Minecraft world. Mojang, you have created a fantastic game involving blocks."
Best game ever it is so fun I absolutely can't stop playing this game still 5 stars but can you maybe add guns military structures and cities it would be like 1000000/5 stars but other than that it is super fun I made friends cool structures and many more fun things download this game if you haven't. But pls get rid of the joystick and all of the other stuff I have been playing this game for 2 years and like all my friends play it so I decided to play it to
"This game has been my comfort game for many years, even though it comes with a price it's incredibly crafted just for your enjoyment. It has a little bit of difficulty with just the right amount of different modes for players who want it harder/easier. Definetly a good purchase , definetly recommend 10/10 (Btw not a bot just really enjoy it)"
"Nice game. Every time you make an update, 100% of minecraft players like it. Ever since 2021, I've been playing it quite a lot. (24 hours be like). I really think some bugs and glitches should be fixed in the future. Also, I think it's THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!! Thank you so much, mojang, for creating minecraft in 2009."
Best game ever! You can literally build whatever you want! There are so many items and blocks to choose from! Exploding creepers to squeaking axolotls you can do anything! Keep up the hard work! Ps: you should add otters they are my second fav animal in real other than Axolotls! They would eat cod and go on there backs in water.
"The game is AMAZING! But what I hate is the multi-player experience. On the night of March 19 2023, the game kept lagging so hard that it crashed the Nintendo Switch... I tried to re open the app, but the app kept crashing. But I got it fixed, but still. Fix the multi-player. I recommend playing this app."
"its really fun, its also very creative. its fun to build houses, survive and other shaninigans. (sorry if my grammars bad lol) i perfer this then minecraft, honestly there is one issue. today i played minecraft and joined a server and it wouldnt let me saying ""you need to have an account"" or ""no internet"" or some stupid stuff. it turns out i needed to update minecraft. i do wish they wouldve told me i needed to update, other then that its a great game that i recommend to anyone honestly."
"As a multi player game,I've got 1 person on one of my servers,but I am so impressed with how it's getting to a non-reachable point that is Minecraft,I also want a uptade called ""world uptade"" with more mobs and things,but packs are the solvers(keep up the good work mojang!,as the pack has,their are a couple of few mobs that'll fit into the game,I was wondering about a kiwi bird,since only creating mob packs are a thing,I still want it without purchasing,and/or can you make more bosses? Keep up😁"
"Though the new controls are awful, I still rate 5 stars because I can just change them when loading into the world. For everybody complaining about controls, go in settings, or uninstall and reinstall the game so when you enter a world it will ask you for 3 options for controls."
"The game that never dies for us.. We may stop playing this for sometime, months or years but we always have time to comeback whenever we have a time. Unlike other games that I definitely don't want to play anymore once I decided to uninstall."
In my opinion I love this game so much!!I know that if you try to play with friends you possibly need WiFi but other then that it's great! No worlds are the same and if you need more furniture you could download mods there's also games that I love to play with my best friend like one block I believe or sky block I just haven't played it but overall I would give it a 100 but since it's out of 5 I give it a 5
"Great game! The controls are very easy to understand. I saw a couple comments saying that minecraft removed the D-pad but no, you can actually change the controls in setting when you are in a world. You can use D-pad, joystick it's your choice. And you can always change it again later in settings. I hope this helps💕"
BEST GAME EVER! Minecraft naver makes you run out of ideas! I love building and surviving! But i would love for villagers to have quests for the player like achievements but easier like a villager wants you to get a chorus fruit and i would really like it if you could use tools for longer as my stone pickaxe broke when mining a cluster of iron then i could not find it again. Overall an awsome game 💗
This game has a lot of rip offs and they are good but not as good as the of and some features in them I want the og to have also the chicken spawn egg is also the texture of the sea turtle's so chicken=sea turtle of and the farmlands are now stripelands/block lands stripes and blocks respectivly so overall good game some glitches mostly good tho and a few bad ones but if this game was free but had adds I would still recommend it to a lot of people and play it and even tho it costs money every ti
I love this game. Keeps me entertained when we are bored. I do not face any problems so far but I would want to suggest that hard-core mode of difficulty to be added. Otherwise I recommend this game to anyone who wants to kill some boring time
"I have had this game since I was 8 years old. It is extremely fun! You can play on servers, your own worlds, and worlds that your friends made. If you don't have Microsoft, then you can only play with friends who are connected to the same wifi as you, but if you have Microsoft you can join your friends who are all the way in Colorado when you in New York! 😉 It is so much fun! I never get bored with it! There are so many skins, and there is a Marketplace. I highly recommend it. It is super fun!!"
"Okay I only give the game 5 stars because ONE I've been playing it since I was like 7, I absolutely love the game, TWO the game is a never ending map of animals, battles, building, nature, and you can even learn to do some of these things in real life. But. The thing is I can't even save my skins from my gallery to my minecraft. I low-key miss the old minecraft where you can save mods and skins. This minecraft only downgraded more then upgraded."
"This is one of the best games ever! I've been playing in total for 3 years! Also I love the range of verity that you can play on like: key board and mouse,Mobile, blue tooth controller /Xbox and one of the coolest vr! Thanks Mojang also I can't wait for the next update (1.20.0) thanks for everything!"
This game is great! The thing thats a bit annoying is the lag and how long it takes to load other then that it works really good its also easy to get skins. And its nice that you can get free things in the market place. I think it would be cool to have more food items though.
"Great game, been playing for more than 8+ years now. I really wish that there could be more enchants for both bedrock and java, and that more potions could be made as well. Lastly if an elder guardian could be summoned in survival using beacons or something...that would be cool. (In my opinion)"
"It's Minecraft so I have to give 5 stars, I've been playing since 2012, hands down the best video hame ever nobody is debating that, so the game: amazing, the new controls:🤮 The original controls with cross hair in middle of screen the movement buttons on left and the one jump button on right, NOW you only have the options of there new movement thing on left or original and a bunch of buttons for everything on the right, it's so stupid, there's no option for the original crosshair one"
"Honestly I've been playing this game FOREVER, and when I lost my pc I was very happy to find MC on mobile. There's a few bugs here and there but overall I really love it. There's so many mods and custom skins you can add now, it's just so fun. I just wish mobile got updates at the same time as pc. But it's still amazing."
"The controls are hard to play on, but it's an amazing game! But I can't sign into my Microsoft account. Even though I put the right password and email, also when I try making an new account it says I took to long to choose a game tag. Although it didn't let me even choose a gamer tag."
"I've been playing other games for a while, also updating Minecraft without see the new stuff. But I opened up Minecraft today to check things out and see what is new! I saw they added a new control method for in-world play, and I really love the cross hare method! It makes it so much easier to move around and control things on mobile. Please do not remove this feature! I 100% recommend this game if you are a creative person."
"This game is just, so, good. You can just create and survive and do everything you desire in the game, it's brilliant. My only problems are the game makes you pay for mods and stuff which sucks and some of the recommended servers either don't work or are pay to play but if you want to play good servers, I recommend Hive, Cubecraft, Galaxite And Lifeboat. Overall, great game, worth the money."
"been playing minecraft since 2012 it's amazing it's the one game i come back to over and over, just bought it on my phone today and after connecting ps5 controller it seems to be having some trouble? for instance the shape buttons are rotated clockwise and it thinks L3 is the share button, also screen will constantly be turning up and to the right unless i hold R2 which then it will go down and to right"
"Best game I've ever played and it gives really good graphics, but there is a slight problem, I do tend to have to uninstall it and reinstall it, but every time I do it gives me a license error and I wish you could fix this Mojang, thanks -Destiny Neeley"
"Amazing graphics creators on here are absolutely creative and love all their work. But I have a few suggestions, could we have perhaps a dimension for the deep dark with its own trees? (The portal is made out of reinforced deepslate), but also, I'd like to be able to become friends with the Warden. My friend Autumn agrees with me, in fact. I think it's a lovely idea. I will update sometime later! With new ideas!"
"My guys are saying they can't play because the controls but what they don't realize is they can change that in settings under the (touch) tab maybe you could play better with more common sense and actually looking with your eyes I literally haven't had a single problem with this game at all ""its perfect just perfect right down to the minuet detail""~homelander"
"I love Minecraft so much. It is such a fun game and you can explore infinite worlds with infinite possibilities. I'm giving this 5 stars, but one thing, I wish I could get it on my Chromebook, but I can't. Almost every computer and PC can get Minecraft, but Chromebooks CAN'T!!!!! Anyways, it is such an awesome game."
"An amazing game with loads of space for creativity. You can build anything you can imagine with the wide variety of blocks, materials, mechanics, and more! Playing with friends is also great as it does not lag and runs amazing."
"Amazing game, almost perfect. There's different controls for people who prefer the old or new ones, the fps is a little low on low end devices, but minecraft has never been an optimized game. The updates are incredible and I can't wait for 1.20"
"Just some suggestions, enhance APK detection, fix big bugs, add more modding capabilities, and maybe add a Mojang made server with some classic minigames and some trivia or some tips and stuff to not only teach the new players abt the game and also add like leaks to it and maybe get some prizes for the minigames. Kinda sounds like the mob vote server lately but it's kinda nice. At least there could be another recommended server and another addition to bedrock to make it more unique."
"I downloaded this game just for the memories and it's honestly still a great game. I would definitely recommend playing it on maybe a computer or something with a bigger screen, as a phone is a bit inconventional, but even the best creators in the world (Mojang ofc) can't fix something like that, so 5 stars!!!"
I love it its hardcore sometimes but fun I killed the ender dragon with no armour or food or sword in hardcore but I always lag I made a city and it literally disappeared when I left and rejoined I still love the game. :new update this year camels in Minecraft 2 bug fixes! I still enjoyed the game can't wait for next update bro. Wish you happy Minecraft buildings! I don't get the lags some are weird but some are helpful. here are 4 top tips for new players 1 always mine wood at the start ordirt
"Minecraft has evolved into a beautiful game. During the day it's a peaceful builder/farmer sim, by night its a hardcore hack and slash survival game. I've fallen back in love with minecraft lately, and I swear everytime I play I find something new that was added to the game. It's a lot. Just a few hours ago I was killed by a skeleton(murdered really) when I came back though, he had taken my iron Armour, and sword. I was blown away, I didn't even know that was a thing. Amazing, worth 10$ easy"
"It's fun to play with friends and start adventures in minecraft. It's also fun to try to beat the enderdragon. The only problem I have is how it says outdated servers sometimes for me and my friends when we updated it already. Also, when we use the same internet, it says we can not connect."
"Ive always loved Minecraft and it's a great game, been playing from a year after it came out, but recently I got on and I normally connect a PS4 controller to my phone to play because I never got used to the controls, so maybe can you enable that feature again? I can quite literally only jump in game with my controller."
"This is an update of my previous review. I have now realized that toggling a different perspective will freeze my game and send me a ""minecraft is no longer responding"" message. I believe that this is just a minor bug but i can live without toggling f5. my platform is chromebook if that helps, and the perspective toggling button is set to F just incase thats the issue. Obvious 5 star >:D"
"I have played minecraft since I was 7, and I still play it to this day. This game can be and mostly is super nostalgic, and it reminds me of the good old days, especially for og players. Just thinking about it makes me cry. I respect this game, and I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for an exciting game with infinite possibilities and tons of things based on your imagination."
"A lot of fun things to do in this game. You can craft anything, build castles, and just exploring the world already is a pleasing experience. Multiplayer is also a fun thing to do in this game, though I still don't like the server recommendation, I need to search for servers in 3rd party websites. Edit: they updated the controller setting, is really smooth now, recommend to all of you all"
"This is a good game to play offline and also online. The new update got rid of annoying bugs, but there is a little more such as my car can just clip through walls and start shaking and breaking, those bugs don't really bother me though. If there is a new update, you guys should add a cinematic camera mode like a helicopter view and at different angles. Overall the game is 5 Stars."
"This is one of my favorite mobile games. Graphics are nice, the gameplay Is good, nice cars and pretty cool surroundings. I think that the way to unlock cars is fair, it's not a pay to win game and it has 3 game modes, Traffic mode in which there are other cars (they have a set path), checkpoints where you follow the yellow light, there is no time limit since it's infinite, and finally solo where there are no cars. 10/10 game and one of my personal favorites."
"This game is AWESOME. Me and my cousin play it 24/7! It's really fun riding around and it has really realistic graphics! There's a few bugs such as: getting out of boundaries, clicking the flip over button over and over to fly, and using the flip car button to get inside buildings. Oh and I think there should be a full version that has a editor, no adds, and a multi-player mode. You don't have to add these though, and I won't get mad if you don't add them in the game, especially since it is old."
"I think it's a really great game but it lacks a few things, for instance, there should be a mini map, with the ability to add a checkpoint, so we can know exactly where we are going, also, there should be a multi-player option to play with friends online, add a few more bioms like an arctic area and a desert, and add a free cam mode, add more customizability to the cars, and the last thing, add a customizable avatar that can get in and out of cars, please consider this, thank you so much."
"Amazing app, 5 stars, my only problem is that every 1-5 minutes or so, it will pop up an ad. Kind of annoying if your in the middle of something. Otherwise, graphics are amazing, same as car designs. If you like adventure, cars, and wrecking things, this is totally your game! Also, can you add police cars that will try to arrest you? Have a nice day! Kind Reguards, McKinley"
"Been playing this game since elementary school and I've still been playing it. For refference, I'm 18. I plan too keep playing this game for a long time! Couple things I would like to see is the old cars from previous versions. Instead of just changing the model on the cars, add it as an entirely different vehicle but for the same mileage requirements as the other versions. Another thing i would like to see is body panel customization such as bumpers, Spoilers, etc., along with ride height."
"Definitely has improved since last I played. I don't think I'd change much about it. Love it the way it is. The only glitch is when the Ford GT rolls on its roof. It keeps going and going and going. Lol. Not a big deal though. The customizations on the cars are awesome. Certain speeds have increased also. Very nice. The Jesko does go faster in real life.....like over 300mph, but still plenty fast at 272mph. Love the classic cars! Collecting the coins is also fun. Maybe a few new vehicles?? 🙂"
"Ive had this game since 6th grade (2016) and this is one of the most fun racing games, not too realistic, and not too annoying. A nice open world game with plenty of missions to do. I'm also glad the game is still being updated! Great work developer! Edit: I've seen alot of reviews talking about the ads, and I agree..there are too many ads, I just didn't think about them when making this review. That's the only thing wrong, is the ads..please reduce the amount!"
"This game is really awesome I love it you dont have to buy anything. You just drive in different environments. IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!! I definitely recommend this game. There is three different places, my favorite is the offroad. It is a bumpy terrain with many hills and mountains. Which when you fall make it so fun cause you get your vehicle messed up . Then you can either fix it or try to see how messed up you can get it. There is also paint shops where you can drive in and change the car color."
"Excellent, very fun game. I did find a bug at the airport, there's an invisible crashpoint, anything over 50 mph and this bump throws the car out of control. I don't know how to submit a bug report, as I have a screenshot of the spot. If this can be fixed, that would be cool."
"Hi friends this game is superb because of its graphics, cars and the map. The cars are super looking and the map is big enough to drift race and more. Also we can add mods to this games. But there was a problem that the commercial ads are playing in 5 minutes, but don't worry when there will be commercial ads and time then simply press the pause button and wait for 7 sec then if you press continue then any ads will not play ok. Download this."
This is the next gen mobile forza horizon. This us the best simulator car game for mobile. I reccomend downloading yet and the ultra graphic is the best to play on.And I recommend the developers to make more parts of the game or add different maps with more different areas so it would be more fun to play with and it would not be boring.I also request that please add a gearbox that we can change the gears for realistic driving and you should add a map to.Thank you and please try to add these all.
"Please put actual car drivers actually playing, and put the option on the main screen, but you should keep the AIs. You should add some natural disasters every day we come back from being away for a while. You should add more upgrade options and more things that can be damaged, such as engine explosions, transmission, etc. You should also add manual shifting. More cars are needed. You should add the Lykan Hypersport. Planes should be able to be ridden. AWESOMENESS! Thank u, tho! Plz respond. GJ"
Well let me say it might be my most favorite car game but there is a slight problem one the passport like come on second why do we have to drive all day trying to get coins and last we don't have our own character in the game so no walking around no getting out of the car but the game is still fun but pleasethe thing I really want this game to update is let us move and please add more places because to me it's just the same old city airport and outdoors but that's it
Hey! Just wanna let you all know that the app you've made is just fabulous. It's like one of my all time favourite game. I've been playing it since 5-6 yrs now. I really love the graphics and just the word remarkable. Though i can't express my gratitude to the one who made it but i can atleast try to! Thank you for this wonderful game... And hopin' that someday you'll make even better games than this one..
"Super cool! I love it,but the only thing I dont l8ke is the NPC cars, especially in the offroad place... the pickups with wood inside,yeah... they are annoying. Everytime I come to drift, a car has to come and disturb me, and can you improve the crash physics? That would really help me! Thx. And also can you fix the glitch when you put the cam on the hood, or the tire, and the first person... in traffic mode,the cars disappear in first person. Can you put in each car their own interior? Thx!9/10"
This is amazing and MINDEBLOING game. I was playing this game approximately before from 4years. If you want a good graphics game then you need to download extreme car driving. Too good game but some simple mistakes are in this game like unwanted advertising and bugs. But overall this is really a extreme game and it's give so many joy and thrill. THIS IS INSANE!!!!!
"It is a very good and nice game I like it Keep it up. Pleas add a land cruiser in car collection . All the features in this game is very awesome . It is the best game I have ever played. The car collection is really amazing ,but the are the badest part of this game are coins and the blue prints ,it took a lot of Time to find them after all the game is amazing."
This game is amazing and I'd like to make some suggestions about the game . Maybe if we get to the airport try to make the vehicles transported to another city entirely and try to add an online racing feature but still leave the offline part but in any case it is still 😎😎🤟🤟 AWESOME
"Best car game I love the texture of the cars can you put multilayer? Or new cars and add new places like mountain,hills or something I'll go back to playing it plus if this is too much work I understand so please if you have time can you put an update for this on like June 10th or May 6th and add more skins! I'll give 50000000000% and 5/5"
It is one of the most best driving game the new update is very good and removing blueprints of cars is better choice but you have to add more vehicles in this game so I get bored because I have every vehicle but you have to remove vip pass for buying cars And add more skins cities and colours And you have to add npc and bikes Like Kawasaki Ninja h2r and bullet But you have to add planes and trains Stations that we can drive and remove Adds and add planes to go to another City and people npc bye
Great game but one problem is that there is only one map you can add more maps make buildings more realistic and let the driver come out of the car add more controls and it will be the best game in the world.
"Thanks for removing all blueprints. You have the most amazing and incredible cars I have ever seen! You should add more places in map. But, I have no multiplayer mode in my game."
"Oh My God. When i was like, 4 i played this game. It was great. Now, I try downloading the same game. Guess what? IT'S INSANE. Everything changed. The graphics, the map, the cars... Great game overall."
"Every thing is great after this upgrade but I want that all the cars must have a heavy noise sound specially racing cars and there is a mega skin of the last car which costs real money but I can't afford it so, please I want you to do some thing like the player can try the skin for 1 hours at 1000 or 2000 game money please"
I like this game price of car is to high also do it on online we can play with friends make more updates Google 😊 anable that we can fly the airplane ✈️ extends the maps city off-road and airport then will more excitement game is fantastic improve more Good I like the game
"I love this game, I am an OG and I remember playing it a long time ago and I played it when it was still in beta, changed so much and I understand why there isn't multiplayer because it is very expensive to get servers. Over all 10 / 10"
"The game is super realistic but I cant play this game for a long because, I am bored with watch ad, buy premium pass, and premium offers. If developers are watching this post, then I have a request. please remove premium offers e.t.c"
"Although this game needs more optimization, I personally love it. One of the reasons being the regular cool updates that you guys keep bringing. Please bring more new cool updates later on as well. 🙏"
"Game's gun only if you get the ultra update,and I'd like to say that they could do better they just need to ad the feature that the character can get out off the car plus the car looks weird as to it's driving it's self and there to many ads"
Hi devs! I love the new update and i still remember playing this for the first time it was fun:) but can you make a supra mk4 and add multiplayer? That will be awesome. Again its a great game and lots of memorise and i rate it 5stars. God bless you Devs 🤗❤️💖
"The game is great, perfect graphics but I am having trouble trying to get the high graphic mode. Plz add body kitz and spoilers"
"Very good game, easily made it into my favourites. Awesome graphics, great and realistic physics. I definitely recommend playing this game."
"Yoooo!!!! The new update is just dope!! I love the new skins and the cars look improvements!!! Just amazing!! But one thing, the interior needs a little more change. When we look from outside the interior is dope but the inside is the same as previous.. but the rest of the things are super!! Fantastic graphics with fantastic cars!! Just love it..😄"
"This game is amazing. It is not boring like other games and with best graphics, it makes the game more beautiful. my suggestion is you should add some more cars."
This game is absolutely wonderful as it is an open-world game. I have not played a driving game as good as this. This game is worth playing. The creators of this game are really brilliant. Good graphics. Nice game............
"I love this game,I would also like it if it had multiplayer because it just seems like a multiplayer game,but this is just a recommendation. Good job devs👍"
This is a nice game. I ever played and graphics are excellent. I got all cars in this game and really game is awsome
Wow!this game is amazing to play in this game car collection is excellent and axes in motion were good and challenges in these were very good especially for the trials were very very good and the extreme city is precious and for driving information are going on and this in game airport were very doing to get courage challenges and the off road nice please one thing as don't check passports near by near exclusively this game is very nice to play and install this game yaar
The game is good the graphics are so smooth cars are so nice but map is very small we want a bigger map
My favorite car simulator I've ever played. Nothing bad except for the fact that when you get all of the cars there isn't another list of cars and it was so freaking frustrating. Overall I think everyone who is a car enthusiast should get this game.
"I remember playing this game around 2016-2020, with the old style and map. I'm glad the layout stays the same, and the fact they did brings back nostalgia. They've improved it so damn much. The only thing which is annoying is the ads, but I have no grudge supporting one of the games that made my childhood."
"It's Very fun and thanks for taking away the scarecrow too I used this game since 2019 or 2020 I used it again in 2022 your competitor (Ultimate Car Driving Simulator) has way more ads (edit 2023) Very nice update of coins,new megaskins & remodeled City 🏙️ 🌆(edit 2023 2.0) I wished that the Lamborghini Aventador & Lamborghini Hurracan Was still there and please bring back the old 26 cars but still keep the current 26 cars And please please please add the capacity of 100 cars add new cars"
"This game is great, it took me back when I was 7 years old, the graphics are insane and the cars looks sick. Would recommend."
I ❤ it but can you like make the game more realistic like you can get out of the and the game should look like GTA 5 but no weapons.Apart from that ❤ the game.Please do what I want all my mates play it I'll tell them to stop they always listen to .ME
"The game is so good , but the thing is we don't get cars for free, but still it is a great game 🎮❤️‍🔥.The game has no lag or any bugs it's easy to play"
"I would highly recommend this for people who are bored, have no internet, and just want something new! Sure, the game might have some bad graphics but it's pretty fun to play!"
"This game sooooooooooooo great. We can pick up the speed into 999 km/h by a hack. Just climb on the plane and move up side down, and just see."
This is a variety game like cars we can experience the vibe and the exhaust sound is beautiful the game is fantastic and insane quality and super sound best game in 2023 the acceleration is super cool the game is better when the ads is removed the game is vibe
"This is the most fun car sim I've ever played. The controls are great, the cars are amazing and the graphics are amazing too. I love that you don't have to use the drift function to actually drift and the map is actually really big and it's really fun to do tricks and drive around the airport. Love it."
INSANE! its also keyboard compatible for most of it and i have no problem with it apart from ads but they only come up 1 in a while so its good The new skins are also insane but there are a couple problems which aren't too big but when you crash into a car it just carries on as if nothing at all happens please change this in some way also please add multiplayer servers also i was really annoyed when i found out you had to play real life money for the new megaskins.please change this
It's a fantastic game with awesome graphics. But driving around the three same city's gets old after a while. Having an extra city would interest me and other players a lot more. Having a multi-player setting would make the game a lot more funner so people can play with friends and expand the popularity of the game.
Bro you could drift in this game! And I'm maybe 12% on getting one of those awesome cars. My one message: creators can you make more games like this pls. I made a glitch where you could go past the side of the airport entrance.
"The game is awesome, there are no bugs, the graphics are quite decent but u guys should've added more customisation that the only problem for now."
I think it's really fun because you could drive into cars and you could also get new cars you could also do a bunch of quests and all of that stuff
"This game is educational and fun but the update, it's a little bit weird. I like the old car's new designs it's cool! 😄 Then I fall asleep😴😅😆"
"One of the best game I have ever played. If you find ads then just off the net. Graphics, sound all are too good. I love this game❤️❤️"
So good and I like the graphics of the game and I noticed that the game had an update recently for example: You can now break pillars New tiers and wheels Cool skins for the clovet car.
I would like to tell something that in this update why don't u add McLaren the old game that so that could be positive good even but u need to add the new map also It could be the best app ever and some reviewers says that to bring Lambo Huracan so pls bring it without it they will be uninstall the game make it the best game man
"Epic, its really realistic and u unlock different stages witch I think I super cool and the goal is..... is there a goal???? I'm not sure but its FUN"
Waooo!! What Simulator Car hame it is. I like the High Quality Graphics. I like the All Cars which is giving in the game. I Like the Offroad too...
"This game is amazing. I played it a couple of years ago, and it was pretty good. Now it is even better. I love this game, but one thing that would make it even more amazing would be to make it online/multiplayer. If this game was multiplayer, I would give this a 6/5. That would make it the best game EVER."
"The game has to be given a 5 star rating, because the graphics of the game are amazing and after the new update it has become even more amazing"
It's fun to drive around the city and different maps while driving your fav car and for y'all parents your kids who will drive in future it is a simulation where you can do a traffic mode so it's like your kids can actually drive
Guys i was on tha plane's wing with my car when it is up it accelerates so fast un expectedly and finaly it gets up with me but i couldn't stay with it for long. I have screen shot if you want i can send you talk to me with my email
If only they could bring the og version back. This game brought me many happy memories and joy to life. I can't imagine if they bring the og version back. 😔😭
"The overall game is very nice but the map is not enough big so, you can make it a big map and please add some more cars and add more challanges.These are my some request.😁😁😁👍👍👍👍"
I like the grafics in the game it's so realistic and the cars is so amazing can you make another one were it's motorcycles only pls and thankyou😁
Probably the best car driving simulator I've ever used(also the only driving simulator I use)I just love the cars you can get in here my fav might have to be the Ford ranger took a while but it's a beast 2 things I want to upgrade is the ai physics please make them more aware of the surrounding areas and 2 the camera please make it so I can turn my camera without having to go into the puase screen oohh one more thing there is a few add problems maybe just lower the ads. Thanks for reading enjoy
"I have been playing this game for a year now and I have unlocked and bought all the cars. I really enjoy this game, have seen many improvements and I think that the Dev's are doing a great job but one thing that I have a problem with the speed, I don't like how the game is similar to the older-ish GTAs with the whole speed thing, but 100mph looks like 40mph, and it's really annoying, I know that there are reasons behind it, but maybe make the speed look a little faster"
"I was 6 when i first ever played, but then I stopped when I was 8. Now, im 12 and revisiting it, and man, did I miss this game, and it's even better than the old version. The ads aren't even that bad. Thank you for making my childhood, although I wish there was more customization and cars, but that's not gonna take away one star at all!"
"It's a very good car driving simulator game. The graphics are awesome and the controls are wonderful. All the cars are beautiful. The city is very big, there is airport, too many garages, different types of roads. It's a wonderful game."
"This game is very nice but I have a suggestion I have this game and ropehero vicetown and I have played both many times This game has limited driving space and no people and one can't get out from car. On the other hand that game has these features including helicopter, glider and a tank but it's driving features r not so impressive.. So jst imagine if both these games are merged, then how fantastic it would be to play. I enjoy drifting in this game the most and my speed touches skies.........."
"Found this game again and I love the graphics. Better than when I last played it. 1 quick request though, can you make crashing more realistic? I would like to see the car I was going 200 mph with crumple when I crash into a wall"
"This game is the world best car game in Android. But we want an update,in this update please turn this game in multiplayer and singleplayer also."
"Dear game devs, this game is one of the best car simulation games and I've played it for about a year. But there's one thing that I'm waiting is ""revving""! In my opinion, if the cars can rev, the game would be better ☺️. And also if we can tune the cars, this Will be No.1 on the list 😁."
"Hey,hii exesinmotion this game is exilent game but you need a make to real graphics and add new car like -supra mk4 ,Rolls-Royce etc cars add.Please my request."
Can you please add nitro? Please make infinite nitrous like 10k credits?🙏🙏🙏 And can you please add multiplayer? That would be wonderful! And I love that u like 10x my money so now I have 4 mill. Nice and 6.74.8 is super duper looper good. This update is🔥💯% This used to be my favourite game back in like 2015-2018.
Awesome but I will recommend more places like shop mall and more maps also add things like indicator horn Overall its good for stunds and drifting this is perfect for car lovers also add exhaust and Nitro
Bro only in 89 mb you are providing this quality this is awesome!!! I liked the game very much but you should make new maps but pls don't decrease the quality or increase mb to gb plz
I play this game for 3 years and the game graphics was reali reali cool it's has low graphics for 2 mb mobiles and medium for family mobile and high and ultimate for 4. And 5mb mobiles and I think this game was 👍 awesome!
It's a fun game. A lot of ads though but they do warn you before they give you an ad so I like that.
I gotta agree for a game that is 19mbs this game has nice graphics and it's Hella nice please bring in new cars that's what I want and new obstacles and modes please
Dear axes in motion racing team This game is the best car driving games i have ever seen. The megaskins and cars are awesome. But for the next update i want a train station and there will be trains moving people moving etc. Thank you.
"Well, I didn't expect much from this game but... I had A little Complainment and add-ons, One bug is the, If I try to Drift, it doesn't Drift As it should... I also Suggest Puting a 1 second Timer To the Redo car button. Can you also add Engine Sounds, Like, If you start to drive the game, I wanna here the Engine Roaring, And Please! Add Fire or flames To the Exposición... Thanks you, That's all! The gameplay Of good, I Mean Very good! Please Notice"
"The thing I like about this game is that there are loads of places that you can go to, and these things you needa fix [1] Make the game not much laggy and there's some bugs [2] Can you add another button on the screen so it can be easier when driving yea and thats it"
"I like this game a lot, I find it for a time to kill, and we, and I think there's a little problem with the game. First, the skin customization is cool all I know, but I feel like it's a little bland, maybe you could, I like more shades or more skins for the game, also, maybe I'd like new locations in the map, I feel like a mini maps like that, you can also see it, and then you should do like racing with like multiplayer, maybe like put stickers that you can put on a car like for the back room"
like it but when you are updating it add some guns and a person who can get in the car and can get out on our comand and we can get on the plane and go to other places with other cars
The game is cool and the Graphics could be better Make the last car less Expensive and add a feature like you could get out of the car
This is the best game I have ever played IN MY LIFE i love the stunts I am doing and more graphics and add more places or forests gungles farm places and more citys and that's it but fix this ads whenever I go to the menu an ad pops out so pleace fix this soon and add more cars and like a house we can buy I am not convinceing you to add the house if you want and add people if add it will look very very nice and that's all i had to say thank you.
I love this game especially since I can play it offline helps a lot I love how realistic it is and its amazing!!!!!
This will stay in my memory the cars are so cool but I want a more extended bigger and detailed map with a more variety of vehicles
The new update is very good quality end over all the cars have new design but the map is not update please update the map for more good update
The best game I have played! Because of unlimited graphics and extreme car and also costume and mega skins! Offroad zone is awesome and airport zone is brilliant.planes has real noise and speed of landing is realistic! Drift is amazing in cars!
We want a route map in the game because it is difficult to wind the right way so please add this feature a route or city map in the next verison
THIS GAME HAS CHANGED SO MUCH. It was still great a few years ago but coming back to play is amazing! Really different and still much fun. I only loaded it up not long ago and played for 5 minutes and it looks great. I have yet to explore what new things have been put on! Can't wait!
There should be multiplayer mode and the map should be a little larger then this game would be one of the best car games
Very fun game. Put together nicely and very realistic compared to many other drive games. I like having the mini games or trials within the game itself. Makes it more interesting. Thanks! Dan
I've been playing this game since it came out i do like the new graphics but some things I wish weren't changed overall its great and fun game to play
"this game is really awesome! my brothers adore it♡♡♡ althouth its a bit tricky for a 5 year old boy, he loves it sooo much and i do too, even though i am a girl 🙂"
The tablet version was fine but the latest update has ruined the experience. Having a split screen for your contacts and the chat box is a daft idea sort it out or at least give us an option for the old layout in the settings. Edit: I've changed my rating to 5 stars the recent update has given us the option to switch back to the original layout thankyou 🙂
"I would not recommend WhatsApp to be used for businesses. However it is very helpful for individual usage. It delivers quick, timely, functional, and consistent communication between any two individuals over half decent Wi-Fi. It has its kinks to it, like kicking you off once you start running low on storage, or automatically downloading the photos of friends when you forgot to unselect that option. But over all it is a great program to use! I am very satisfied whatsapp messenger"
"UPDATE: 🍾🍾🍾 Congrats on the new desktop app! What a sleek, clean finish. Love the new filtering options. Addresses exactly what I mentioned in my first review. The transition was tricky, but you made it! Great app. The only thing that I can see is missing is how messages are grouped. For those of us who have to prioritise responses, it would be super helpful if unread messages remained at the top of the screen so that one does not lose sight of responses that still need to be sent."
"I would love to see separate rows for groups and broadcasts in the app. It would be so much easier to access my groups and broadcasts without having to search for them. Additionally, it would be great if we could pin our most frequently used groups and broadcasts for even faster access."
"Awesome app, been a fan since inception and it keeps getting better! I have 2 suggestions though: 1. Have an edit option to a message that has been sent (as apposed to deleting the entire message, especially if you are only wanting to correct a spelling error or retract a sentence, as an example). 2. An option to turn WhatsApp off WITHOUT having to turn your data or internet connection etc off."
"Let me start by saying WhatsApp is a great piece of tech! Especially for businesses that use it to chat with clients, share documents, updates, etc. It has checked so many boxes that it may seem like a challenge to improve further, but I believe a simple addition would do just the trick. Adding folders to WhatsApp! This would be an ability for users to group clients, friends, family, and construct sections based on their own needs. Decluttering the workspace and allowing for more productivity."
"Split screen feature is good for large screens, but there are many bugs which have come along with this feature like when i click on buttons it doesn't work, secondly when i click on the replied message it doesn't take me back to the original message and lastly i cannot right swipe messages to reply. Edit: All bugs has been fixed"
"This app is so so good, incredible! I would give this app 20 stars! You can download this app, it's add free and really free to use, you can chat with your friends and family..... I would recommend you to add a screenshare option in the call, so talking would be more fun! (Just like they did on zoom) one more thing I recommend you is to change the split screen view, it actually looks horrible! hopefully waiting for the update! THANKS!"
"I am satisfied by this app. It is very simple, helpful, useful, reliable, private that's why you deserve five 5 stars. But I want to add somethings, this could be better if we could put videos as profile photo, not only a picture and also, update the version of stickers, something like telegram stickers. I suggest also, while adding an animated sticker on a video, I wish it remains animated, not being like a basic stickers."
"Have been very happy with the recent developments. Never had any problems with using WhatsApp and have used this in a business environment and never had any issues changing phones or with my other apps. Always take a backup and restore on new installs. Recently have been using the new linked device feature and now have two installations of the service on my Galaxy without any service issues, it just works! It's taken a while but WhatsApp have got this right rather than rush a feature out."
"The best app for messaging and all things related to communication. I do wish you could have a feature wherein when someone sends you a voice note, and you listen to it, it could appear on the recipient's phone as ""Listening to voicenote"" for you don't really know when someone is listening to you voice note or not."
"23 March 2023 This is a very nice app. My personal rating is 8 out of 10 because I don't like the backup process here, it would have been better if there was a permanent backup system, I never had to do the backup. Also, to see the active status here, I have to go into someone else's inbox, like in messenger if the profile picture. It would have been much better to see the active status with this and also it takes a lot of time to view your profile It would have been great if there was a profil"
"I love WhatsApp's simplicity. I believe that's why it's able to load faster (unless you use a ram that's 2gb or less). I even had a dream one time that, you could hold down a chat, and edit it, before 24hrs, instead of having to re_write it below the wrong one. It's a good app. I love it."
"Already fixed : Please quickly fix for split view feature. There should be button to turn it off. I have been waiting for a long time already. I will turn my star to 5 again if it's already been fixed Thank you for the new feature, locked by finger print What if clear chat feature can be set for the time/period (example: from what date to what date) so it can help users to clear message"
I think a feature where all normal chats and group chat are grouped together under one column would be really useful and helpful since it's hard to look for a specific group beneath all the private chats. And it is really annoying when you accidentally press voice call or video call and the other person can see it even though we end the call before it even rang. Please make it so that it doesn't register in the call history when you end the call before it even rings.
Great to use. I have been using this since 2014. But I want to recommend something. You must bring an update where we(users) can opt status showing facilities. If any user doesn't want to see other's daily status then they can easily turn the status section off.
"I would not recommend WhatsApp to be used for businesses. However it is very helpful for individual usage. It delivers quick, timely, functional, and consistent communication between any two individuals over half decent Wi-Fi. It has its kinks to it, like kicking you off once you start running low on storage, or automatically downloading the photos of friends when you forgot to unselect that option. But over all it is a great program to use!"
"Hello! I've been using WhatsApp for a while now and I have had no problems with WhatsApp. You guys make some good updates with good features! I just have a recommendation though. I wouldn't mind if we had an option to decide who should see each of our status. For instance, I posted a few things on my status. But, I don't want certain persons to see the second thing or at least 2 out of the 10 things I posted on my status (for instance). I really hope you can do this. Thank you!"
"WhatsApp is an essential app that I use every day to stay connected with friends and family. The app is incredibly easy to use, and I appreciate the simple and straightforward design.I highly recommend WhatsApp to anyone looking for a reliable, secure, and feature-rich messaging app. With its easy-to-use interface, end-to-end encryption, and variety of messaging and calling features, WhatsApp is simply the best app for staying connected with friends, family, and colleagues. So five🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"Thank God for the new update. Tablet users should think about updating. They’ve resolved all the issues. You can chose to split your screen or not from the chat option in settings. Swiping, redirection to messages and statuses are equally back. I don’t get how their developers got that mess anyway. While thinking about updates can we have a different interface for groups? Like can we view them separately from single chats? It’d be great, specially to delete unnecessary groups."
"There is a small problem with contacts sync, we often contact many people and talk to them on phone call and we have to save their number sometimes, but that doesn't mean that every person is our known or friends whom we are comfortable sharing our statuses and not always everyone remember to update status privacy, so there should be by default a use case where until you talk to a particular person on whatsapp they won't be able to see your statuses and this should be from both side."
"Made new feature for status privacy in which user can made different lists to share his status to choosen person in the list like if one need to send his status to his friends, family, school, collge etc mates, or to his job mates So he can select hist specific list and share his status for them. Anyway i love❤❤ this app too much all features are outstanding 👌👌"
"WhatsApp is a messaging application that has been popular worldwide for several years now. It has become a primary mode of communication for many individuals, families, and businesses. Here's my review of WhatsApp: Pros: User-friendly interface: The app has a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy to use for everyone, regardless of their age or technological background. Cross-platform compatibility: WhatsApp can be used o"
One of the most used and favourite app of all around the world now is WhatsApp. One feature must added to this app now. I feel it's very much needed also. When we select multiple pics or files we can only forward them to others. Instead if share option is provided it will make us easier to share them in other apps also like Facebook messenger etc. Please provide this feature in the coming updates. Thank you
I loved it at first but the new update with split screen is a HORRIBLE user interface. It is quite annoying and is not pleasing to the sight. I have no idea what the developers were thinking by making the interface on a phone scree the same as on a desktop screen. The next update should get rid of this. I wish I could give 0 stars Edit: Good thing they added the option to disable it. I'll give 5 stars now
"I love WhatsApp, I can post stuff to my 3 brothers, 1 in NZ 1 in London and 1 in the US, message them all at the same time. Then I can also text all of my friends and wish them greetings, I love WatsApp. I didn't like Facebook. Once when my daughter was living in Dubai, two Arabs with the same outfits on, popped up. Being nosy I went onto their page. It was so awful the image I saw, I'm never going on it ever again, it was that bad. I can still see it now, cruel things. So don't leave me."
"I cannot scan this qr code, to use web what's app. It's out for over a month at this stage. I can scan other QR Codes no absolute rubbish. A complete nightmare. Even their 'support' are telling me it's outside their support. I've lost so much work over this it's unbelievable. There's no option to log in or out either. However, there is a problem code. I'm not sure whether it's the app or just my phone. Every time I send a message. Please need sending me this. What's app is consuming a lot power"
"It's really great messenging app for personal use. I would suggest to add some features which I faced difficultly in. While sending status, we select who we want to send status everytime (in Status Privacy). Isn't there any way we can make shortcuts just like ""Friends"", ""University Friends"", ""Family"", ""Business Contacts"". These should be like Labels which contains a group of contacts in it so we don't have to select individually each time. This is so hectic beleive me 😒"
"i was transfer my WhatsApp Data from IOS (iphone 13 pro Max) to Android 12 via transfer tool (Tenor share) total data is successfully transferred, but i am facing a backup issue. when i am click for backup, after 15% of backup the WhatsApp application is going to restart and percentage start again from zero. Please fix this issue ASAP. Now i am using WhatsApp without backup. Thank you."
Recently I'm getting few spam calls per day in WhatsApp. I would like to propose to add a new feature to WhatsApp which is to only allow calls from contact list when it is enabled. This feature is very helpful to stop spam calls and hope you will consider this.
"WhatsApp is simply the best messaging app out there! 💬 It's user-friendly, reliable, and secure. I love the seamless communication it offers, from texting to voice and video calls. The end-to-end encryption ensures privacy. It's a solid five stars!"
"Everything is great, but it needs a setting where you can put a password cause the finger print one does not work that well. Not saying you should remove the finger print password I just mean that it's better to add other options of passwords like a number password or just a password, something else that isn't a finger print password. That way you can have better privacy whit out being constantly frustrated that it's not reading your finger print."
"This is a good update for type easily in other languages like tamil ,hindi , marati Japanese , traditional Chinese and etc. We can keep voice message for status. Lastly there is a option I'll tell you if you delete any message they will give you a option for undo till 3 seconds. Thank you"
"Good for texting people from your contacts, No ads (AT ALL) plus you can connect different devices to your Account so you can text from your mobile, PC Etc. Etc. You can also Call people and video call people. Works well on all devices highly recommend if your looking for a new texting, Ringing App 👍"
"This is the best app to use when messaging friends and family. There is only one thing that I want in the next update is to be able to edit your messages, because I make some mistakes and I would like to be able to correct then be editing it."
"It does what is labelled on the package - some good ol' wholesome videochat, phone and text is just exactly what the Doctor ordered. On a serious note though, I have used WhatsApp for many years and its an app that even my non-tech savvy 76yr old mother can understand, especially during the pandemic of 2020...and now she finds some excuse or other to use it all the time - thank-you, WhatsApp! 🙄 I highly recommend this app. Its very easy to use and not as technical as Zoom."
"App is very useful. Status privacy should contain broadcast list also. While updating status ,there should be freedom to make list of contacts to whom your status is visible. So I kindly request to add these settings in status privacy."
"I really like this app. For mobile, computer is quite more difficult tho. Ppl r complaining about the back up thingy, you can set it to automatically back up every day or something, thats what i do. Obviously it could improve but this is just my point of view ^^"
"Dear WhatsApp Team, please allow both sender and recipient to add notes to voice messages. This feature would be very useful when a chat is full of voice messages and users would be able to quickly find messages without having to listen to all voices again and again. Thanks!"
It's a very good app for communication and it's gives a better entertaining experience. I can easily transfer a lot of pdf with a few time. It's just need a small level of network for messaging friends. We can easily share our beautiful moments as status and we can hide our status from other strangers. This app gives a better privacy and a good experience. I love this app❤️.
"Best messaging app. Would recommend it to anyone, unless you don’t want strangers messaging you. But then again, no worries because you can block (and delete) strange numbers. Just found out that I can’t send videos longer than 3 minutes. If that is true and remains that way, it'll be the only thing I hate!"
"Thank you whatsapp for the new update that finally solved the split screen issue and provided the option to switch it off. One trick, though, you need to change the app aspect ratio from 16:9 to full screen from sitting to get the correct view"
"I love using WhatsApp for messaging my friends and family, but I really wish there was an edit message feature. It's frustrating when I accidentally send a message with a typo or mistake and can't go back and fix it like I can on other messaging apps like Telegram. Please consider adding an edit message feature in a future update. It would make the app even better and more user-friendly. Thank you for your hard work"
"This is a great app for communication, one of the best infact. Thanks also for the update to make chatting oneself possible. It's amazing. But I want to ask if it is possible to lock chats, for instance, the usage of a password, pin or biometric to enter a DM, particularly the one written to myself. Thanks."
"Dear Facebook Team, I appreciate the updates of Application that we are using now. But, we all need one option is TEXT EDIT Option. If there is any error in typing a message, rdit text option will helps us to make corrections wherever necessary. Kindly update the Field. Thanks & Regards PAVAN JOSHUA THALLAPALLY"
"My experience with whatsapp has been great. I just have a question. In the upper left hand of the app where it says online or typing every so often there is appears a number that that gradually goes higher. What is that for, and y doesn't the person I am texting see these numbers."
"February 28, 2023 This is very friendly and very easy to use. But I would like to give a suggestion that I Think is important and will be helpful for the users around the globe. And The Suggestion is as: 1. Include the option that shows when people are inside the chat screen or they are out side the chat screen. The option for which i am talking about has already been included in Facebook Chat. I think it will really be helpful for the people in many ways as per there need. Thank You"
"This is a great app. I see it as better than the built-in phone calling feature as with just Wifi one can make cheap overseas calls. But, I have a bug/glitch report: sometimes when Whatsapp is opened and i unlock my phone, the chat would show in messages from some time ago instead of the lastest messages at the bottom of the list of messages. Update 2023-04-26: Pls add the feature of letting me edit the messages I sent."
Personally like that messages and media is encrypted for personal privacy of messaging and content. Been using for long time. Extremely useful when sending several pics @ the same time OR videos that are a tad longish. Calling feature is very very very useful when traveling outside US and ur phone has no service from ur service provider - can use it to call home with WIFI service in a hotel.
"Poor, time consuming , I have been trying to update and download the new versions of Watssap for the past 24 hours with no success. But today 6th of May 2023, I tried to download the app again and it worked like magic. I will advise users to update the app late in the night. Mine was done around 4:56am."
"Excellent! It's safe as well as super easy to utilize. It's ideal for remaining in touch with loved ones in a risk-free and also safe and secure method. Nobody can review your messages or listen to your calls, so you can feel confident that your discussions remain personal. Very recommended!"
"You're really doing well in your updates and the new development you're adding to the App. However, don't stop until you're able to add the enabled ability to edit message posted when typographical errors are noticed. This will make this App more superb that AAL others Keep up the good work"
"I would not recommend WhatsApp to be used for businesses. However it is very helpful for individual usage. It delivers quick, timely, functional, and consistent communication between any two individuals over half decent Wi-Fi. It has its kinks to it, like kicking you off once you start running low on storage, or automatically downloading the photos of friends when you forgot to unselect that option. But over all it is a great program to use!"
"I love the app. It's mostly efficient and easy to use. I just have a problem with when you send multiple pictures and some reflect as unsent when they are or don't send at all until days later. My suggestion would be to have an option to disable automatic downloads for specific groups and not across all chats. Another suggestion would be to allow audio files to be sent on the status. That feature used to be there in 2016-2017, don't know why it was taken off. All in all, the app is great."
"Need help with respect to my old WhatsApp messages. Today, when I opened my WhatsApp, I got only today's messages, however all the older WhatsApp messages, audio and video files are not appearing. Request you to help so that I can retrieve those messages. However, I take the back up of my WhatsApp data on daily basis. All my previous chat history is not appearing in my WhatsApp group. Please help me to retrieve all my previous WhatsApp messages asap. Thank You so much"
"Good experience overall, clean interface with easy to reach menus/icons. I would suggest you include an icon which gives the ability to switch to voice calls only, from the video call interface (as the only option available is to switch from voice only to video)."
Thank you so much WhatsApp for easing communication. It's great to use this app. Also I request for your attention on editing sent pictures. I discovered once I edit a sent picture in gallery....the edited version appears still in the receivers pictures received.. My suggestion is if possible please you stop this issue...such that sent pictures can't be altered even after one has edited in his gallery. Thank you so much
"It's the best messeging app ever! I am using it for many years. I haven't seen any problems till now. You can use it whenever you want. We can chat with whoever we want, we can watch status of others, we can do voice and video call to anyone around the world. It's just the best app that's why i am giving it 5 stars. And i hope you will update new features ☺️ Thank you 😊❤️"
"WhatsApp is a popular messaging app that allows users to send and receive messages, voice calls, and video calls over the internet. The app is free to use and available on both iOS and Android devices. One of the standout features of WhatsApp is its ease of use. The app is simple and intuitive, with a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to find and use all of its features. Users can create groups for messaging and easily share photos, videos, and other files with their contacts."
"I love the app and the new features! Something that would make the app even better is if you added more than one reaction to pictures sent, because my best friend will spam me and I'll have multiple reactions to each snap because she's gorgeous but I can only pick one ☹️ also if multiple pictures could be put on view once💀 it's quite tedious having to select individual pictures to put on view once, the excitement dies ngl."
"Lovely app with very thoughtful updates like the poll questions. Can we have some kind of clock/alarm feature in chats too? Especially group chats to help remind the group of events, like an online meeting for instance. Also can we have an ""@everyone"" feature. It's so stressful to @ each person on the group just to make sure they see a particular message. Or at least the option to ""pin"" a message for a period of time. I'll be back If I remember more. Thank you!"
"Functionally well-made, Graphics & Features are good. Only problems concerning is my issue with backups. Especially with the chats when I delete my app & redownload it. Hoping for furthur Improvements. & Better using experiences. Thank you to the admins. Much Love & support to your team. Sincerely, Conqueror of the Wilderness"
"personal messages and calls to friends and family are end-to-end encrypted. No one outside of your chats, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them. Simple and secure connections, right away All you need is your phone number, no user names or logins. You can quickly view your contacts who are on WhatsApp and start messaging."
"WhatsApp has been functioning well, however I have a suggestion. Can WhatsApp create a feature to schedule a sent message for a particular time. Most times when I want to send a very important message, I can be conscious of the person's time and wouldn't want it to look intrusive and yet I would not want to postpone sending the message."
App is wonderful I love using whatsApp for messaging my friends &my family it wouldn't make tha app even batter and more user friendly. But even after these much features you are failed 👎 to given an option to export multiple files it's possible in I phone (ios) if someone send me multiple documents/images and I have to email then please work
"Really a good app.. WhatsApp is mostly used. But there is one problem. Many people would like to have a status duration of more than 30 seconds, because 30 seconds is not enough time to upload some video status. So I suggest whatsapp LLC to give status time more than 30 seconds in next update. Many people will like it. Please consider my request. This is everyone's request."
"This is a feature request: the ability to group chats together into folders. Right now my chat is a mix of family, friends, and my intermural sports teams. It's messy and I can't even sort the muted ones together so that they're less in the way. It would be great to have folders I can slot chats into and keep the chats I want to see daily outside those folders. Hope the request made sense."
Nice app works perfectly for business recreational purposes and friends only one problem is the backups. They seem to have a glitch where i cannot recover my backups. Please fix this because i lost my everything here. All that aside great app
Really awesome App. Thank you for creating this App for people who really can't afford to pay the charges that even the best mobile phone company's these charges can really add up so quickly! I have given you all five star's The only problem ⚠️ I have is that the phone calls or video calls always will stop! WHAT THE FUC! IS WRONG NOW? WHY DOESN'T SEND ME THE CODE? MY PHONE WORKS JUST FINE YET IT CAN'T SEND ME THE CODE IS WHAT IT KEEPS TELLING ME¡! NOW I AM PISSED!
"Sometimes WhatsApp backup can be a bit slow and hangs while using the phone. At times, it affects usability while doing google drive Backup and can slow down things when I need something quickly off hand and makes me unhappy/frustrated. Increasing storage space on phone causes it to stop working unless it is backed up very often. As of 14th May 2022, many issues with Google Drive backup, it keeps stopping up until a certain percentage and it goes back to the profile screen and options, 81% stop."
"Feature Request: Give an option to receive voice and video calls from saved contact/known people just like the option provided for story/status. Lately I have been receiving calls in WhatsApp from unknown number thats likely are scammers. I don't know from where they are getting my number. Humble request to kindly implement this feature, if possible."
"I have been using for years and it’s very convenient to use. It helps me to communicate with different people and with each update, many surprising n handy features added. It has never failed to surprise me. I also love the sticker feature when I wanna be cheerful and fun with my family and friends thru message exchange. Good work developer!"
"I just want to suggest ,u should add one feature where selected chats can be hide from the rest all as there r some private chats which we don't want to show anyone if they open our WhatsApp .....U have given option of archive but that can be seen on the top which is of no use then.... otherwise overall it's a good app for chatting with dear ones 😄☺️🤗"
"Very easy to use. Has many easier features to use than messenger and SMS....stores an abundance of photos when sending to friends.....by far the best, to date, messenging service available."
It makes it so easy to do a quick search and post to the Community or group. I use it while playing my games and it allows me to talk to the entire group at the same time. This has truly put my players on the fast track. I love how i can create sub groups for teaching or events. Brings the players closer as friends and it's just plain fun to hang out in.
Very good app I'm able to send messages and make calls and when I even don't have internet it lets me send messages and when I don't have recharge I can take anyone's internet and call my friends I think that when we buy a new phone it provides us Netflix and many apps but it should also provide us whatsapp
"So far, WhatsApp is really doing a great job. I would also request if you would consider adding a feature that would allow one to lock a certain chat and also increase status time from 30 seconds to maybe 120 seconds. Otherwise, WhatsApp is awesome and i enjoy using it."
It's a nice app for messaging and stuff. It has perfected messaging as we know it. They should add a search feature so we can search for those who check my status instead of scrolling to look for names. And I think they should add the feature to change your captions at anytime.
"As a tutor on GuruQ, I have had a great experience so far. The platform is user-friendly, and it was easy for me to create a profile and start my classes. The payment process is also straightforward, and I appreciate the convenience of being able to receive payment through the platform. I would highly recommend GuruQ to any tutors looking to expand their client base."
"As of my opinion this is the best messaging and photo video sharing app. I am old user of this app and till now I never have any issues except when you don't have good internet connection or you have to share a large storage videos upto some hundred mb, but we can share that also as in parts. And also it's different features available. I strongly recommend this app to those who don't use it or want to try but having doubt for the security or anything else."
This Is an amazing app you can express your self through status and other people can respond to them you can create groups with lots of people and if you don't want to talk to somebody just block them. You can also choose who to see your status. Your profile most of the times tells something about the person. There is just so much stuff I can't put it all in Overall review:100/10
So far the most convenient communication across the world app I have used. Cheers to the makers for especially improving the audio and video call quality. Though I would like to know why the quality of pictures and videos reduce when sharing.
"So far so good, I've been using WA since 2014 and there were so many changes and improvements. Personal suggestion from me: Please add a feature that allows users to create a group (kind of folder) of groups. For example I can have a group/folder of family groups, a group/folder of office groups and etc. So that I can differentiate and organise incoming messages systematically."
Can you add some awesome features like message scheduling ? It would be very amazing feature if you add this . But in this new update there is something problematic like the undo option. When I am deleting any messages and in that chat if anyone is sending me message I can't see the message quickly It would be better if you put the undo option on upper side.
"4.5 GB free space, caches cleared, turned off and on and still, for what is now in excess of 20 attempts, not installing. Not surprisingly they keep deleting my one star reviews cos they don't like their half baked system being embarrassed 🤬🤬🤬 UPDATE MARCH 2023 I did eventually get the app installed after some more head scratching and it's worked perfectly ever since. This is why I now rate it at five stars."
Actually Amazing i use it to text my school friends i love the feature where you can share moments on your status! There are no adds but the sad thing is you can't get it on your ipad. You can facetime voice call add people to the call and join the call even if you left! I am really proud if this app it's came a long way.
This website s very helpful to user like me who s not very much computer literate. I 've enjoyed using it. I always look for the green icon of whatsApp. Let it be shown on my page so I won't be always searching for it. I notice that the font on this app s hardly recognized. I do not know what to click in order to increase the size of the font.
"I've been facing ""reconnecting"" issue for a long time. Whenever I receive or make a call, 1st thing that appears, is reconnecting and then voice breakdown starts. It happens time and again during every call. That makes me hard to have a conversation with anyone. I would like to request to resolve this issue. I'm unable to have a conversation with anyone while the issue is there. Thank you."
"Fantastic app.. doubt you'll see this but anyways, one problem, though, when you mute a conversation because the person's getting on your nerves, it doesn't mute their whatsapp calls, and it's very annoying it takes over your whole screen and the only way to get rid of it is to decline the call. Please allow us to mute the chats and their harassing whatsapp calls. Thank you, brilliant service and free with no ads. There'sno way you can fault this app with the service you get from it,for nothing"
"Such a great app with lots of amazing features. Was just wondering if it could be possible to pin individual messages too, and not just chats. It'd also be nice if ""play in background"" can be enabled for voice messages"
"Ideal messaging and also video calling app on the marketplace. It's straightforward, trustworthy, and personal - ideal for interacting with your family and friends. WhatsApp services both mobile and also desktop, also on sluggish connections, without subscription costs."
"WhatsApp is a great messaging app. It has become part and parcel for the modern generation. There are other messaging apps too but we feel more affection toward WhatsApp. It's interface is so simple that most of the people use it. It's new features are always surprising after updates. But Unfortunately, I think it lacks a thing that, in WhatsApp group the newly joined people cannot see the older messages and it creates a trouble for them. I hope you will have a look at it and keep growing."
It is one of essential apps. WhatsApp has many features but one feature needs to be looked into. Messages sent in the last 1 week doesn't show dates. It only shows days. It makes us difficult to quickly recollect the date of message
"It's a great application! I have been using WhatsApp from many years and I would say this is really an amazing app we can communicate with people and can share photos,videos, documents etc through this app. The more exciting thing about this app is that we can easily upload our status to show our day-to-day life activities and that status lasts long for about 24 hours. I love this application but I would suggest that you should some more new features to this app to make it more interesting."
"WhatsApp may have its downsides, but overall, it's a lifesaver. I can't speak of all the ways this app has made life smoother for me. If you want an app that encapsulates every (almost all) of your digital communication needs, download install it now."
"Sometimes, the connection is poor. However, I'm happy to stay with WhatsApp at the moment (this is what I said three years ago)and Over the years, WhatsApp has improved quite a lot. However, technologies keep adding new things, and WhatsApp is not an exception. I'm sure WhatsApp has a few tricks up their sleeve to delight us all soon."
"Good ,but we want some more features like mod WhatsApp.It also very very super features like save status and caption,hiding chats with fingerprint in the logo of WhatsApp, Translate automatically to which language we want and many more.I more like the font changing option in modWhatsApp"
"Please add a feature whereby you can remove a person from the group by just clicking on their phone number or name after they sent a message. It is hard having to look for the person in a group of 300 people just to remove them. Thank you, I trust you ""Meta Team""."
"The app is fantastic, but the only feature that I'm missing is the"" double tap to give heart reaction"" to the message, like the other platforms like insta and tiktok are providing, with the feature to give custom reaction that Whatsapp is also providing, but the only thing is: we have to hold a message and then tap the heart emoji, which is quite long step as compare to double tap Hope that in the next update this option will be added.."
Its a good app to use communication wise with family and friends with there new features upgrading each time .. But what I would really love to see is when the developer of the app brings in the LIVE feature now that would be a good move and be able to select themes and more inapp setting privacy wise and chat wise
"It's the best at what it does and I'm trying to get my friend and family to all use it. A few things could make it so much better though: 1. PLEASE REMOVE READ RECEIPTS!!! There is a reason this wasn't implemented when email was invented, it is unhealthy for communication, and people hate it! 2. Video calling is buggy//laggy across multiple devices and networks. 3. Sometimes sending a video only send a screenshot instead, can't remember what triggers this... Overall great app though, 5 stars"
"Such a great app! Smooth experience with regular updates and great free features. I love all the little details, like the ability to edit photos before sending, the cool emojis you can tap for effects that everyone sees real-time, being able to set who can see your profile picture and which picture they see, and themes you can set globally. Also, you have so much control over your account's privacy! Additionally, the app has a pleasing design, good security features, and no ads. ✨"
"I really hated the new two tone themes (I don't like green or pink, I want flat telegram blue), but eventually I figured it out. Back to telegram blue and darker background. You have to go to theme editor and then click the three dots on the color circle and then tap the bubble to change the colors of the bubble and put all four to the same color if you don't want a two tone. Back to the old theme! Just like I like it. You should make a default ""classic"" there so people can quickly switch back."
"Hi, Telegram! I would like to request a feature for a future update, if it's not already in existence, and I'm just not aware of it.. Something that would be really helpful, would be a way to break up specific messages into folders, for quick access. I use Telegram as much as a note pad, and place to share ideas, and brainstorm with my family (i.e. lots of think-tanks), as I do to just send messages; so, having a way to organize specific messages into folders, would be awesome!!"
"Telegram is the best messaging apps in my opinion. Better than anything else. What I like about it is because it can share a much better pic resolution. I even have the option to select a specific pictures(out of thousands sent to me) to be saved in to my memory card. Save me a lot of hassle. Plus the privacy in this app is very good, if not great. The interface is smooth, and look professional."
"No doubt it is the best app for communication. Moreover, it's cloud storage system and bots automation is on whole another level. What I like about the app is privacy, user friendly, constant updates (new features almost every month). I am using telegram since 8 years now, and I can proudly say, there is no such app till this time, that can even stand in competition with Telegram. Thank you!"
There are two features that I find missing. One is the ability to choose sender/recipient sides (e.g. my messages to be on the left). On the desktop there is a useful feature to disable the bubble effect and to get classic chat style - all messages aligned to the left. The second is a public message box feature where anyone (no account needed) can send a message to you. This can happen with just email or a phone number. Keep up the good work :)
"Certainly Telegram is the best communication app. Amazing updates in short period from a clever and creative team. A note: In the new updates, when playing a voice message at a speed higher than 1.5, if I do something outside of Telegram and the audio file is still playing, the sound of the audio file will be interrupted. This problem is more noticeable at higher speeds."
"Such a great app! Smooth experience with regular updates and great free features. I love all the little details, like the ability to edit photos before sending, the cool emojis you can tap for effects that everyone sees real-time, being able to set who can see your profile picture and which picture they see, and themes you can set globally. Also, you have so much control over your account's privacy! Additionally, the app has a pleasing design, good security features, and no ads."
"Previous review was about a persistent ""gift premium"" button issue, which was quickly resolved with developer feedback, so kudos to them. In general, Telegram remains my main and favourite messaging app, so I hope their monetization strategy won't become more aggressive with time. That is to say, I'm all for people getting paid, but please don't achieve that through changes to the UX for existing users (which I thought was the case with that gift button issue)."
"Amezing features, good interface. And it's a lot better than other social media applications, only the problem is we are not able to retrieve our chats messages and the groups once the app get deleted or the account status get closed, it's complete itriversible process overall the interface is very smooth."
"All is sorted, app is functioning well, the connection issue is much less frequent now. The calls can be a little weak sometimes, as it takes quite some time to establish a call and then once it does, There's a big delay. Although this may be due to the other person's connection."
"No doubt it is the best app for communication. Moreover, it's cloud storage system and bots/automation is on whole another level. What I like about the app is privacy, user friendly, constant updates (new features almost every month). I am using telegram since 4 years now, and I can proudly say, there is no such app till this time, that can even stand in competition with Telegram. Thank you!"
"Telegram is an outstanding messaging app with a user-friendly interface and a wide range of features. I love the seamless synchronization across multiple devices, which allows me to stay connected with my contacts no matter where I am. Additionally, the app's security features, such as end-to-end encryption and self-destructing messages, give me peace of mind when sharing sensitive information."
"THE BEST messaging app EVER. I write after almost nine years using it. I can't believe that other apps have just thought of the features that Telegram has been offering all these years. Telegram features are unique. For example, infinite cloud storage. And interestingly, despite the maximum satisfaction of users, Telegram is still getting better day by day. Personally, the relationship I have with Telegram is the relationship of a person with a very understanding friend. telegram is my friend."
"Hey Team, I am Rilesh. Here is my honest opinion and suggestions for improvement of the app There is no doubt that app is great But there are some features that you can include or create to make app even more better There are channel where you can store files but the management is not so good if you add feature to creat folder inside channel or may be customisable grouping of items inside group and channel then it will be easier to group or make folder of same type of data."
Best platform with more features them all other platform combined. Awesome groups. It just takes time to get to know all the features and settings. Don't forget to link up your contact list. Theirs another more private telegram version that's downloadable on @ telegram . Org.....
been using it since 2011. a user friendly interface and supports group messaging and big files transferring during my construction work back in the old days. with more easy to use and better UI update makes me still using this app. keep up the good work
"I 'm a telegram user, great app, smooth experience & no doubt it is the best app for communication. Moreover, its cloud storage system and bots automation is on whole another level. What I like about the app is privacy, user friendly, continuesly updates with new features & security features almost every month."
"I've been using telegram since some years ago and it's a great app. But, I have an issue I wish you could fix. The maximum number for photo profile is 80, it's not enough as I love using a lot of photo profile. I hope you can consider expanding the number. Thank you."
"When my friend told this app, I have just ignore him but when all my friends told to use this app.I Thought that I may try it, when I try it I was shocked. I have never seen an app with all accessibility, the background change button, some search, invite friends and music etc. BTW I do not understand that when I download one video from come channel it gives me a black screen and the voice is going. ThNkx"
"It's a pretty convenient app, it can be a better alternative of WhatsApp and other messaging platforms. Other than being able to express your words to other people you care about, if you plan to store a tons of files, telegram is a great choice for you as it offers a huge capacity to store whatever files you wish to save for future use."
"I've just one problem in telegram, and that's the ""mute"" bottom position in the down side of the channels. It happened a lot that coincidentally my finger tapped this bottom and unwillingly a channel become unmute or diverse, so if it's possible can you move this option (mute bottom) to another side or in other options of the channels. Tnx"
"This app extremely good for those who ain't capable of purchasing subscription like Netflix, Amazon prime etc platforms. It gives us latest movies & webseries right to their releasing date. So, according to me, it's one of the best apps I've ever seen!"
"Telegram is a great messenger. There are just a few things that I think should be added in it. 1) Ability to reorder your avatars. Now it can be done only by feature ""Set as Main"", which is long and annoying. 2) Ability to restrict messages from bots. 3) Ability to hide messages in channels. Some channels make great content, but ads in them are just cancer. And I would like to hide it."
"SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DEVS 1. I would love if I had the ability to accept certain types of messages from all or from specific people in order to have a more focused an intentional experience, like accepting only text messages and not media. 2. Having the ability to create sections/topics for different part of conversations is crucial for any community. I hate Discord and I would love to use Telegram for more complicated groups and communities with many topics inside them, but right now I can't."
"This is an amazing app. It allows me to send messages with ease. Though I find it difficult to upload a photo, video or chat. But I enjoyed every other features in the app. Kudos to the developers."
"As a Telegram user, I highly recommend this app for secure messaging. Its interface is user-friendly, and the end-to-end encryption ensures that my messages and calls are safe. The app also supports file sharing and group creation, making it versatile for communication. Overall, it's an excellent app for secure messaging."
"Easy to use chat app. Telegram provides Telegram Tips which are really helpful. I like how the app organises my personal chats from all chats. The app is useful in other ways too. You might find yourself invited into some Telegram channel, but you can hide notifications if you find it annoying. It just depends on how you use the app. I would say Telegram is less restricted compared to other chat apps, but yeah..."
"Overall nice app and very helpful. BUT ! I got spam by a mistake , I can't use this app properly. I've been writing to official spam bot since January . Now it's May ! Nothing is changing. I have a lot of limitations in my account. Please lift the limitations so I can use this app with pleasure. Thank you very much. Thank you I'm free 🥳"
Excellent communication app. Easy to get up to speed and use whether you want to use advanced features or not. Even when my absolutely horrible cell service provider Visible was not supporting calls/texts I was in the loop with friends thanks to excellent Telegram's phone/message service.
"This is the most innovative, feature rich messaging app that exists. Far & away better than anything else out there. Been ahead of the curve consistently since inception. It is fast, secure and best of all, doesn't have Zucks nosy fingers all over it selling your data and info to advertisers. So many innovations way ahead of when Whatsapp got theirs. And continually innovating without forcing updates down your throat. Just a breath of fresh air all round. 10/10 recommend!"
Very active and flexible app. Growing faster than users expectations which leads to our satisfaction. I have just a problem which my phone doesn't show some characters ( square boxes ) and I did not find a solution on web.
"The apps so good, I been using it ever since I downloaded it but the recently problem I encountered, the app needs an update, I been scammed by a stranger in telegram telling that he is a part of customer service I tried to report that maybe he will be banned but the problem is that there's no report button. I hope you added for protection if someone are going to scammed. Overall, the apps is so good."
I don't know what I'd do without this app. I mainly use this for transferring photos with friends due to the ease of exchanging in higher resolution but it's also great for joining channels to find information regarding specifics events
"Telegram is good for business chats and the photo/video sharing here is efficient, easy to use. It's also nice that there are many stickers to choose from."
"Hi telegram, I love your photos quality, how your chats can be divided into folder, how it is easy for me to use in any gadget.. however can I make suggestions? I wish Telegram can also make us to upload folder in chats, for example folder of photos, to make it easy for us to find photo. Thank you, I hope you can look at my suggestion 🙌"
"Hi, Telegram team. Recently I notice that lots of people suffer from the screenshot hack. I would like to recommend one thing to stop the ""screenshot hack"" from happening. You can add an extra message after the login number message so that the login number wouldn't show on the main chat session. This will put a stop on it. The extra message could be anything lol. Add it and it should stop the scammer for a while :) Hope you consider this suggestion. Good app."
"Great for musicians! Outstanding to be able to edit and delete after sending, video and large files can be sent without being compressed or truncated, well done!"
In one words it is Godfather of every application. No app can made even a little bit of its comparision. We can get everything here. But only things to improve it is it's downloading speed. After all it is the best application in every aspects.
"It had been very wonderful the best out there. I have a suggestion, how about adding a pause function to the voice note recording. Therefore, if one is interrupted while making a voice note, you can continue from where you stopped."
"why not add features to choose between high quality media files and compressed? If that too advance for most of your users, then leave it at settings, my company needs high quality media, for fast sharing and access to everyone, since e-mail were not fast as your service. Also, discussion topic on group or channel, sad to see how its cluttered chat in group. Thank you for your kind understanding. Hopefully the feature implemented immediately."
"Best messaging app you can ever imagine. Always a step ahead of every other alternatives out there. I've reached a point where I don't really feel like this app needs any more improvements, but they still add some new features out of nowhere that makes life a ton easier. 5/5"
"The Telegram app is a fantastic messaging platform that offers a high level of security and privacy. It has a clean and intuitive interface, and its features like secret chats, self-destructing messages, and customizable themes make it stand out from other messaging apps. Whether it's for personal or business use, Telegram is a reliable and excellent choice for secure communication."
"My opinion this app is an exceptional messaging app, boasting top-notch security, speed, and a minimalistic user interface. Its powerful encryption ensures privacy, while the cloud-based architecture allows for seamless syncing across devices. With features like channels, bots, and large file sharing capabilities, Telegram goes beyond traditional messaging, catering to the diverse needs of its users. Constantly innovating, Telegram has become an indispensable tool for secure communication."
"No ads. Quick and simple alternative to standard messaging. Fast, effective and efficient. Great app to have. Automatically connects you when your personal contacts join telegram they are added automatically which is nice. Also is nice and private."
"Such a great app, smooth experience with regular updates and great features. Like the ability to edit pictures and photos before sending them to others. Nice emojis you can tap for everyone to see real-time. Can control your account's privacy."
"Perfect app! Been using it for about 6 years now. The lastest update had some profile photo problems that when you open a profile, their main picture isn't what they chose as the main one if you know what i mean. Please fix this thank you very much."
"I've been using Telegram for several years now and I absolutely love it. The app is fast, secure, and has a ton of features that make messaging a breeze. I love how I can easily create groups for different topics and the ability to send files up to 2GB is a game-changer for sharing large files."
"I really like this app. It is light, fast, unique, user friendly and most importantly, could based. Also it is less hardware demanding which means it won't consume much of your RAM or CPU power. The only thing that make it special is it won't change the quality."
"Helpful in many ways in my experience I can only say that I've encountered this app as a way to make things easier and accessable to anyone in need of it's use to top it all up it brings more joy to have access to other apps and be able to install it by the way I see it now it is fine with me but maybe some may argue that it needs a little bit of work there and there cause not all opinions will be the same, but regardless to me it's fine until I find something missing to add a little something"
"Overall Telegram is the best and has a user-friendly interface. Its available on multiple platforms, including mobile devices and desktop computers. It also allows users to synchronize their chats across devices, which makes it convenient to use. Moreover, Telegram is free to use and doesn't contain any ads. Thank you."
"WhatsApp was and still stays on 1st place but now shares with Telegram. I recommend this app to all (age is not important so it's good for kids & senior citizens. Customizing the app is Neverending story in a good way, there is music, culture, sport,politics and more from official channels to make a channel in 5min suggests a theme and you can relax, so also you can get pretty lost in app.. talking about time lost, just customizing it, or quality of video calls = 5 ☆"
"Love the app, use it every day to keep in touch with friends. Only complaint: please remove the feature that rearranges sticker packs automatically. I have them in an order on purpose Edit: the option to turn off auto-rearranging was adding, so I'm changing my review :>"
"Everything is great about this application as it is perfect messaging app however telegram should listen that delete for all feature should be limited for some time period after that the person should not be able to delete, currently you can delete the conversation any time and other person does not when it was deleted. Think about this it is very important"
The app represents an awesome experience while communicating with social friends. Everything is what it should be. Though I thing the only feature the app lacks is a material you desing and theming. Just hoping that the feature will be added soon.
Editing my original review - That latest update seems to have fixed the crashing problem. I haven't had any crashes so far since the update. Seems whatever it may have been that was causing the random crashes has now been resolved. Thank you!
"Best messaging app ever developed. I'm using this platform for about 9 years and nothing beats it. WhatsApp looks like absolute garbage in comparison with it and in terms of security Telegram is one of the best. Remember, this is a messaging app, not a calling app and the features exceed anyone's messaging requirements."
"It's been a long time since I've been using this platform and everything is perfect that really makes Telegram a great messenger app.But there has been a bug which always bothered me and as time passed I hoped it would get fixed; Which didn't and that really disappointed me. There are uncountable types of gifs that I wanna save and use them, but unfortunately the limitation stops me. Either I have to let go of my old gifs or the new one I wanna save. I really hope sooner or later, it gets fixed."
Really like the app..good messaging app that's easy to use. Interface is simple and straight forward & i appreciate how fast messages are delivered + i have plenty of options to customize my chats.. This app known for strong privacy & security features. Highly recommend this app to my friends.
"Easy to Navigate. Fun Emojis! The best message app I have used so far. Quick movie downloads. Can edit messages after posting, and add bold letters to emphasis. Can delete message for all persons if I make a mistake, great group message app."
Telegram seems very fast with mobile data. Texts are quick & Calls have been clear & haven't dropped yet. Telegram is a very simple app to use & I love the lockout screen to keep wandering fingers out. As long as Telegram is truly encrypted & secure then your corrupt government won't know your business.
"This one is my personal favorite. A messenger with the best UI/UX and a lot of useful features. Voice-to-text, translations (Premium only) and a lot of smiles/stickers, along with all that any regular messenger/video & audio calls app needs."
"Overall, Telegram is an excellent messaging app that offers fast, secure, and reliable communication for both personal and professional use. With its user-friendly interface, versatile features, and robust security measures, Telegram is undoubtedly one of the best messaging apps on the market."
"From my 3 years of experience, I can say that Telegram is the best messenger in all virtual networks, the best design, the best security and the best speed. What else can you say? It gets better and better with every update, please continue"
"This is very useful app, you can contact with your friends. You can download media without having full storage problem. I can watch movies with my friends here. It is very useful app for me"
So far this is the better app when it comes to image and files storage. Didn't necessarily auto download. I like how we don't have to save a number just to message them. An ideal for office workers 😄
"All the Bells and whistles of messenger with better emojis, no interference, censoring and it's just cool. You can have 200000 people in a group plus 20000 can watch on video and 2000 can interact with that video. The numbers could have changed since it's posed but again I just liked the app"
"Telegram is a great app for messaging and calling, but it could be even better. If I off my last seen, then I am not able to watch other's people last seen. It would be a great way to detect other's people last seen quietly. I hope that you will work on this issue very immediately."
"It was great, but the new update has bugs, it's not as smooth as it used to be. And there's no proper way to stop the bots, I don't wanna block the bots I stop them and they can easily message me and spam messages. Please fix that. Thanks for your great app"
As a Telegram user. I highly recomment this app for secure messageing. Its interface is user-friendly and the end-to-end encryption ensure that my masseges and calls are safe.
One of the best communication application. It is super quick and have a privacy control. Such a great application where you can get in touch with loved ones in a touch away.
"It is the best messaging app ever made. Doubtless. Highly recommended to fellow friends all over the world. It works perfectly although, I am not sure about the searche engine circle... is it limited or searches based on characters written globally? 🌸 Sincere thanks and warm handshake with the design and software teams.🌷🌷 Weldone Telegram Team👌 reza"
"One of the best social apps in the market. Good interface, user friendly and alot of options for sending important media or files. Also does not resize the file sent."
"It's the best messenger ever, especially the latest update was awesome. However, I've had a tiny problem with the last few updates. My problem is that the music won't pause when the bluetooth device disconnects and the music continues playing with the phone speakers. I wish this problem will be addressed in the next versions."
An incredible messenger with user friendly ui and the most important thing is they keep making telegram better and better every moment. Each update contains new and useful features. In some last updates i had a problem. It keeps hanging again and again But thanks for everything
"Very very happy that it's fixed on Version 9.4.4.After this update version 9.4.2, I am not able to translate Chinese words anymore. It automatically selected not to translate ""Chinese"" in my settings and I totally cannot undo the setting at all."
"I think this is the most powerful, reliable and secure app ever made in the world, ..this have everything you need once you started using it, you would love it. I personally wants to tight hug the developers for such a revolutionary app. Most amazing features i found is the photos, video, document files and everything will be stored on their own secure cloud forever, you can access it from anywhere in the world and from any device. Thankyou telegram to make my life so easy. 🥀✨💝"
I like this app really very useful one 😍.Really very easy to download films and tv series through this. And very beautiful interface ... We can change our chat theme too I love that ❤️. And we can make folders 📂 to chats it's really very good 😊 very helpful 💕.
I love using this app because I can store as many photos and videos as I want without using my phone storage. It's a convenient way to transfer file as well. Thank you for developing such an amazing app!
"I have now uninstalled this via the Play store as Google was censoring content, like replies to posts in certain channels. Channels I myself signed up for. I hate censorship so I downloaded the APK directly from Telegram and installed that. Then uninstalled the Play store version. Worked like a charm."
"Absolutely wonderful app, and social platform. If not one of the best, in courtesy, professionalism and thoughtful interaction. Keep up the good work, telegram."
"Thanks for this wonderful application. My suggestions: 1. Please provide option where ARCHIVED CHATS REMAIN ARCHIVED when new message arrives similar to WhatsApp. 2. Sort chats into Personal, Channels and Group in tabs form by default. 3. Please do some work up on contacts. Everytime they ask to sync on opening the app. Love from India ❤️"
"Such a great app! Smooth experience while using this app. Very stable, fast features in this app. We can also secure our privacy from others. Easy to download the files"
"The subscription fee button is intrusive, it blocked away the scheduled chat button, I got mistaking thinking that they make it a paid service. I hope that's not the case Update: Developer replied, I see that it is a mistake bug, back to 5 stars as long as the above is not paid, good job developers 👍"
"Has good features, but also bugs and inconveniences. For example, the bubble feature in android randomly stops working (I get a black screen). I then have to close the bubble and open the actual spp. Uncool. The video call quality is bad when talking to other countries (huge delays). Last but not least, the notification sound system is simplistic. I would expect a way to ring only once if many messages come at the same time (within 10 seconds or so). Now I get tones of rings - VERY annoying."
"That's the best app for chatting. When it comes to others' complains, their phone may not support new versions of telegram. It is easy to use, fast, and i think secure"
"Miles better then WhatsApp! Much smoother, a lot more features and just so much more control and intuitive layout and features. Also i trust them a lot more with my data than FB/Meta and they still have the to end encryption. Must better experience sending media - my photos aren't a blobby mess from overaggressive compression. I wish all my friends switched"
"very stable, fast, reliable and feature rich but without making the app feel slow, laggy or crowded. yesterday there was a small bug which didn't affect functionality but when i tapped a notification it opened the list of conversations instead of that certain conversation and today it's already fixed and it works as intended once again. keep up the good work guys!"
"It's a great app. I have no words to express gratitude as all my preaching activities are smooth and efficient with the new features. Dear developers, please fix the following: 1) usb mic not working with telegram voice chat 2) view option for number of participants in a voice chats , it's there but when participants speak it displays who is speaking instead . Thanks"
Excellent features and cross-device compatibility. Works great on all device and has a lot of cool features and there's no limit size of video that we can share with others.
Thank you for the great experience. Here is a recommendation: a feature for opening multiple chats/groups/channels simultaneously. Somewhat like a split screen. For example I'd like to have two channels open side by side so as to not have to constantly go back and forth.
"user-friendly interface and a wide range of features. I love the seamless synchronization across multiple devices, which allows me to stay connected with my contacts no matter where I am. Additionally, the app's"
"This app is very good I have never given any app 5 star this app deserves it. It is thousand times advanced than whatsapp, twitter, viber, signal, facebook messenger etc, it has all the features, except one feature is missing still I will give 5 star, if the developers can bring the feature of add folder in saved messages this app becomes truely awesome without any next thought. I bet the best chatting, messenger app in the world telegram. I have not tried call quality as yet but it is marvelous"
"Absolute applause for making an app for tablets. Finominal app! I am insanely impressed. Keep it up. I will now be your loyal fan and report any bug I find here. Seriously, though, the telegram app across devices is a top-notch messaging app"
"This app is utilized by my hero Edward Snowden. It uses end to end encrypted text messaging and calling. Great for privacy minded persons who are highly against government (NSA) eavesdropping legally without a warrant or even permission from a superior to listen in to your conversation or mine or your grandmother's. If you have not seen the true story, the film named 'SNOWDEN' IT IS IN MY TOP 10 MOVIES OF ALL TIME ALONG WITH CASINO, GOODFELLAS AND THE DOORS. I EVEN USE THIS APP OR SIGNAL.apk."
"Telegram is one of the best communication applications, and it was still like that, unless everything changed, because I can no longer enter the application, as it exits on its own. I do not really know what is happening, but I hope that you will find a solution to this problem, and thank you for your efforts"
I would first applaud the developers of this app for doing a wonderful job by creating it. But I have a small problem with it which is I have put a password on it and now I can't remember it. So I was hoping if you could put a forgot password feature which will some of us. Thank you. It's a great app though
"Good app. I have one issue. I am not able to send multiple videos as videos as per filename sequence. Even if I send via gallery and filemanager, it uploads as documents."
Telegram is an amazing messaging app. I find it to be more than that. It's amazing when you need to send pictures to your friends without losing resolution. It also helps to build a communication network.
"I like your platform. Very popular app and the story/ reels are my favorite. The effects and sound I can add to my edits are your best feature. Is there a way that you can change or amplify the quality of the postings? I would like a to see a difference in that particular area because it's getting old and decreases my/your audiences interest, when there's some really good pages that deserves attention. Motivational, encouragement etc."
"Idk I like the messaging system, it's easy and works really well, posts and feed are what you like and you can scroll endlessly Edit: I've been having trouble with putting music on my story if it's a photo. I pick a song and when i do, it just says to try again because it didn't work. Please fix this."
"Instagram has been one of my favorite sources for the content that I like to view and interact with. It is easy to set up the account and does offer a Pro Account option that offers more features. You can link this account to other Meta apps, such as Face Book, and the link allows you to post reels and images from app to app. You control what to share across both apps and can change it as desired."
Older adults can benefit from a service like Instagram if they use it to exercise their memory and creativity. It is also very entertaining and often informative. I have saved many product ideas into a folder for future reference. Useful and fun products are advertised. Many of these make excellent gifts. It also helps me become more adept at using my phone's features.
"Instagram, I love you, but please help me. My explore page completely reset. I spent months building my page with things I love and enjoy... But it reset, and now there's generic, boring stuff that I'd never look at. It's like it's not my page. I looked it up and others are having this issue and you guys haven't posted anything about it. Please fix this and please tell me how to fix my explore page. Thanks!"
"From the stunning visuals to the endless array of creative and engaging content, Instagram truly has it all. Whether you're looking to showcase your own talents and creativity, connect with others in your community, or simply get lost in a world of incredible photos and videos, this app has got you covered.And with its intuitive interface, easy-to-use features, and powerful tools for editing and sharing content, there's never been a better time to start exploring all that Instagram has to offer."
"Suddenly these options ""keep watching or watch again"" from reels dissapeared,it keeps playing on loop. Unable to view it in full screen mode on tapping it just mutes the video. Have to visit the peraon's profile to view it in full screen mode. Even for long videos(more than 16 sec video), ""keep playing"" options disappeared. Somethings just went wrong with the instagram! A"
I have been using Instagram from a long time. Its an amazing social media app. But there is some issues that didn't fix by instagram. I can't upload stories with musics I would like to share. It have been a long time the music library is worst. There is no updation and I couldn't search and find the musics I want to share with stories.
"The Instagram is not working so well. When the user update a photo to edit, this session performs a random actions, like copying the same photo. Story's screen have some problems too. I'm receiving random followers from around the world, but are strangers profiles, that's can't be normal. About the translation in the comments is something to solution too. That's it for now. Thanks's for think in the user :)"
"From the stunning visuals to the endless array of creative and engaging content, Instagram truly has it all.

"I find the app very satisfying except when I am occasionally stifled by limitations imposed on me by the app or management. I Love Instagram tremendously and am finding it the best forum for promoting my Pic-App-Art to as many folks as I am able to, & quite invitingly! Thanks for the app & the format to share our artwork, photography, and personalities with people around the world! We appreciate it much! I would only suggest more outlandish filters, & stickers, As well as special effects! 🤩"
"This app is so good for social media. But from two months onwards the reels button had disappeared and i updated my app but even though I can't see any changes in my account. I've reported bug also but still I didn't get any changes. Please resolve it ASAP, give updates"
"A lot of good reviews and I enjoy this app as ❤️‍🩹, but in modern day this and almost every other app, is breaking up homes and relationships across the world. They are all sex sites and dating sites. However I like it for the beautiful places I'll never go, and the extreme weather report reels."
"I think app is quite good! Since you can communicate with friends, post about social life, have updates about others mutuals, movies, celebs. But i have one issue i wish we could change the text colours of the messages to others it would be cool!"
"I didn't expect the ads/""sponsored"" videos and images, but I should have - considering it's a free app. I enjoy nature photography, so that's mainly what I'm here for, and there are many nature photographers to choose from. Overall, I'm really enjoying Instagram."
"Good app and works as should. The only complaint I have about this app is that it was awesome the first few years it came out, seeing all your friends and family post pictures was a good time but now it's been taken over by advertisements, which I understand they have to make money but I just miss the past, I guess."
All features is very useful in thise app . Its the platform where we can easily share everything . And the reel options is one of the best part if Instagram . But there is one problem when we call somebody the notification badges not showing on the screen . You need to improve it.
The best social media app. Every feature it has is very unique. Overall great user experience but i want instagram to add one more feature is that to send multiple saved reels in one go as there are two option in saved unsave or add to collection please add one share button also so that we can send many saved reels in one click.
Instagram is a great app . You can easily watch a lot of content and ideas from all over the world. But sometimes there's a glitch while uploading photos or videos that one cant add music to the post or the videos just buffer too much .overall great experience. Keep it up(⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠)
"It's amazing to share things on Instagram. It's really helpful for business and connecting people. Instagram is helping People to follow their passion, Actually it gives wings to all those, who wanted to fly and explore the sky but couldn't be able to do for some or the other reasons but, with instagram, they are exploring the new fields, they are exploring themselves and that's the best thing about Instagram. So yes, Use it wisely, use it purposely, try to share some goodness Stay Happy 😊"
This would have been a better app if all those glitches are cleared and made this app bug free. Some messages are cannot be seen even after it is delivered and I couldn't zoom the profile picture. There are more and more bugs that I couldn't list all out. Some features are available for some users and not for others. Hope those bug would be cleared at the earliest
"""I absolutely love Instagram! This app is a great way to stay connected with friends, family, and even people I don't know but share similar interests with. The platform is so easy to use and I love how it lets me express myself through photos and videos. The filters and editing tools are top-notch, and I can always find inspiration from other users' posts. What's more, Instagram Stories is a game-changer! It's the perfect way to share daily moments with my followers."
"I am not able to use the new cross app messaging feature in my account. I have tried doing everything, uninstalled, updated, everything but there is no option to update the messaging. And when I exit the app and turn off the screen, I don't get any DM notifications. And even if I get, I get it hours later. This is annoying me."
I've had a really great experience..... But from a few days I'm unable to open reels.. And it shows 'We're sorry something went wrong' and I'm unable to see reels even if they are shared with me.. It's a real problem here please do fix it.. Other than that ......It's an amazing app..
"Overall, the app is convenient to having to use the site all the time. Love being able to connect with friends, family, and everything in between. Appreciate the constant updates to keep up technology changing."
"Why did you remove the manage likes thing? The main reason why i give a like to a post, is to be able to find it again. ""Oh, but you can save it"", yeah, i save what i know I'll like to find a again 2 years in future. Just opened the app, wanted to find a particular post i liked yesterday, and i couldn't; it's lost in the empty space of data. Just give us this feature back, its very useful and i believe it wouldn't be that much of a thing for you to care whether if it's there or if it's not."
"absolutely love Instagram, it has the best short flick clips that are hilarious... thought provoking... etc. .. It's fun to interact with other with short comments on every subject under the sun & great introductions to new music. I love Instagram as a relaxer to unwind. ✌️😊"
"I dont know what the problem is, but for the past few days the app is not loading on my phone. It looks like a bad network where the loading icon appears for everything, but the network is fine. Tried reinstalling many times and the issue persist. The lite version works just fine. I cannot even access the help centre from the app. Hope I get a solution."
"Superb app.. I like it most... Go for it all... It helps in showing your talent in various ways.. Very much supportive.. We can creat and post videos easily in it... We can keep our privacy safely... It doesn't likes your informations to public.. I am really enjoying this app.. It keeps secret to your information.. It publishes your talent in various ways..we can post photos, videos, posts, easily as quicker than anyother app... It motivates our mind in a positive ways.. I love this app ver much"
"So far it's been pretty great I have no complaints and I look forward to seeing all the new skills I'll have and memories I can make and share even better . This experience I speak of , of course is in reference to my Google pixel 6 pro phone . Also if anyone has any tips for me about this phone I am opened to suggestions ."
"Up until this last update, I was very happy with Instagram. However now I haven't been able to use Instagram video calls in over a week despite uninstalling and reinstalling the app, clearing my cache etc. I've sent in a dozen support tickets, but none of them even show up as saved once I submit them. Also tried emailing the team with no one responding, very frustrated. New update fixed, thanks Instagram!"
Insta filtered photos dont get saved nor reels are getting edited properly.. lot of issues from long time.. thought my phone is having issues but only on Instagram!!!??? Why not other apps too... Please help me with this!
"First of all this is my most favorite social media app. I can do some kind of stuff searching people nearby or celebs is very efficient. But a little thing that I don't like and that is replacing of things like notifications shift upwards and you sometimes reels option disappear and these things happen without any update. IDK why it is happening but this app is overall great, so you can easily interact with others to know more each other"
#GodWithUs thanks you right now for the smooth and enjoyable experience thus far the interface is great and I have to say as I look back upon my experiences in the last 6 years or 6 months with the ability to go straight to live video or recording a video from not even being inside of the app in the ability for the actually work and say without crashing or stopping or losing the information or file is amazing and exactly what I was looking for as opposed to every other one that did not.
"It's good and all kinda getting used to it now because I am new, ☺️ so after update it gets better so every bug is fixed by updating it pretty cool app! But not until the developer has to find out thst whenever i try yo upgrade my account (exist out and log in again) i spend hours to log it which always gets me worried that i thought i wouldnt be able to log in when i try to put in my number to recognise the account i have to wait till tomorrow please fix it!"
Very interesting and I am still a little bit of a novice user. Would not be long before I am a good person to whom will be able to have some fun time with the app and I would be able to get to meet up with people who are able to have some fun time together and then go for a drink or smoke or do something with that Person. I'm old but I am still a very good young person at HEART ❤️❤️❤️
"The app overall is alright but I have had a lot of trouble in positing my Stories and messaging, I don't have any emoji reactions and I can't even reply to one particular message, it is so annoying and I have tried everything to sort it out but it hasn't been a success. This version lacks features and has a lot of glitches. I hope these can be fixed at the earliest! Thats my a/c @i__prince__790"
"I love Instagram, it is really a wonderful and beautiful program, and I love the developments that occur every once in a while. This is a wonderful application with which I can get acquainted, communicate, have an effective dialogue, participate, and even build beautiful projects"
"I like this app for it being so convenient to use . It's a good tool to promote your page ,your business and to attract attention towards your page.I like how well it's connected with Facebook and syncs our contacts. It's a good experience."
"Everything works great i love it using this app for quite a time i really enjoy using it, only one issue i dont know why my reels option suddenly disappeared. I contacted support but i got no response."
"It is a good app, dont get me wrong. Yes there are adds but still the quality and work put into this can be seen. In this we dont have to purchase any memberships or put money to get this working and for that reason i give it 4 stars and to do editing it is very simple so, extra 1 star"
"i don't really have any major complaints or compliments because i only use this app to text people, but sometimes i want to find something in the chat and it takes a long time to scroll up that far, so a search bar in the chats that let you find specific texts would be VERY helpful! thank you for reading"
The app does not seem to stay consistent with what version it should run. One account runs the latest version and the other runs some previous version of the app. This has become truly annoying as I want the same experience even when I'm using a different account. I even unsubscribed from being a beta tester to see if it is causing the problem but it isn't so. Please fix it!
"If you're trying to find a great method to share your pictures with your good friends, then you require to take a look at Instagram. This mobile app lets you easily share pictures and also video clips with your buddies, in addition to follow other individuals to get their most current images and videos. Instagram is certainly a great method to monitor all the images and video clips you take of your favorite minutes."
"I really like Instagram, and I hope it can be better in the future here I can make friends from people all over the world even I also make friends with artists, but I want Instagram to remove the unfollow feature and free everyone to communicate with each other, prohibiting people from using it. or harsh comments Like this, this is also very good, it will be great Like this"
Having fun with this app. N so glad I can reach around the world with my family n friends. And use all of the benefits this app. Love the filters and making friends n stories n Reels. Love posting n finding art.. How to use it n always trying and inquiring about how to make it more fun.😎✌️it's cool keep it up.. Instagram 👍 I'm always looking for more fun and games and friends.. thanks 😎✌️👍
This very good social media app I love this aap but there is something that I think insta have this feature in which we edit music also after posting or deleted music is also show on our posts and stories and delete multiple post after posting so plz... I requested that u should add this feature in Instagram as soon as possible... 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I am very impressed from this social media apps. I really loved it and it's giving me an inspiration from others people to learn more skills and build personality over this platform...so it's superb app for me and I get my love 💗 also from there.... lots of memories had connected with it....so l never forget about anything that happens in this app....
"It's a complex app. I love the fact that you can make professional and artistic reels and that almost all the musicians have accounts here. It have some issues like every single app, especially with the boots, but they can fix the issues."
"It's a been year that I've opened an account in Instagram. Neither i get the feature of reacting on text messages with emojis nor swiping right a text message to reply to that particular text is available. After a lot of updates, it still ain't available. Also there's no theme option. Please do something."
I'm in love with this app! As a calligraphy artist I sale my artwork through Instagram people find my page to purchase easily. Thank you Instagram! I only have a problem that an unknown person can't send me a request message I don't receive it from non followers please do something to fix it!
Instagram is a social platform that allow user to share photo and videos with friends family and followers it is a visual platform that can be used to show case ones creativity hobbies interest or daily life many people enjoy using Instagram because it allow them to connect with other who share similar interests discover new content and stay up to date with latest trends. Instagram also offers a variety of features such as filters editing tools and hashtag that allow user to enhance theirphoto
"Fairly easy for a moderate user like myself. I have not advanced to using it to promote my writing, which I would like to do, but am still a little overwhelmed by the advanced functions. I also get too many ""offers"" from people to help, that just turn out to want $$."
"I wanted to let you know that there's a minor bug. If you save a reel and right before selecting a collection you swipe down, the app gets stuck on a single screen. Nothing moves but you can hear other reels if you swipe either way."
"I personally love Instagram, I am in android user and I find Instagram easy and not laggy at all, its so simple to use and its perfect for work and just making content in general, highly recommend, so simple, easy, and reliable definitely give it a go. It's so good for any online purpose, you get to express yourself to others and show the world your unique lifestyle! 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟"
Cannot invite anyone to collaborate. My account is a professional account. I have uninstalled the app multiple times. Have updated the app multiple times. I have reported this issue under the help/report section multiple times. I did everything that can be done from my end. The app is great just fix this problem for me
"It will be good if we will be able to post our photos as per our year. For example, if I want to post a photo that's two years old then it will be good if I can choose that particular date and time and post that photo. if possible, do work on this scenario as it will great for those people who started using this app later on. Also, do add a feature for editing already posted comments because it's difficult to delete the entire comment and write it again as we don't have editing option."
"""I had a great experience using Instagram! The platform is easy to navigate and offers a wide range of features for sharing and discovering content. I love being able to connect with friends and family, as well as explore new communities and interests. Overall, I would highly recommend Instagram to anyone looking for a fun and engaging social media experience"
It's very good app to use and it has lot of features . But every time i update some of the features are not working properly in other 2 accounts . So it's very inconvenience to use while texting like reacting through emoji it's not updated yet . Please kindly fix the problem as soon as possible . Thanks in advance.
"Love the app, I like the fact that you can post pics and videos unlike tik tok and editing the pictures is really good. All the functions are great, maybe it could be a bit more saver because I nearly lost my account so... but apart from that this app is amazing and I wish I knew about it earlier"
"This app is addictive and also it is easier to make friends on this app than any other applications out there , but my advice is that Reels recommending algorithm should not make loop , it depresses me . Even though I have submitted not interested for 2-3 times still same reels are showing up . Please fix this issue. I really appreciate the guys who are working behind instagram everyday to give us best experience of using this app💕💕 . Thanks you guys .😄"
"This app is awesome and efficient, it is the new frontier in social media networking, it's fast and connect you to your desired market and audience. Everything you need to make your photos and pictures come alive is already in Instagram. I'm having the best time, posting my products on this app. insta... Continue the good work."
"I take back my nice and kind comments on this app, at least for now, somehow the app just started hanging and before I knew it I couldn't access my instagram account, whenever I try to log in it says that I should wait a few minutes before trying again or error. It has been doing this fot quite a while now and I even tried uninstalling it then re-installing it and that still didn't work and the funny thing is, I downloaded the lite version and it works smoothly. I would appreciate any help."
"And very pleased with Instagram it is properly maintained and patched on a regular basis. I just a regular home user not a commercial checkmark purchaser , or content creator , I love photography that is why I came to Instagram back in 2013. I hope it returns to more still image based and less tik tok oriented"
"nstagram is one of the most popular social media platforms out there, and for good reason. This platform has something for everyone, whether you're into photography, fashion, food, or travel. As someone who has been using Instagram for years, I can confidently say that it is one of the best social media platforms out there. One of the things I love most about Instagram is how easy it is to use. The interface is sleek and intuitive, making it a breeze to scroll through your feed and discover new"
"Very Good app .. attractive interface, Good UI, minor bugs. Good to use and to interact people and being connected. The major issue I notice is with reels ..Reels are getting more and more offensive and bold. This needs to be stopped"
"Love Instagram so much. I watch reels first thing in the morning to get me in a good mood for the day. I'm not really all that savvy with social media, but I've started using the features Instagram offers, and they are so fun to play around with. Very user-friendly."
for oldie once understand '#' all systems go. Truely...a picture paints a thousand words❤. So lovely to share with people and see what different types of talent/ viewsthere is the world through pictures. Just wish there was a folder system so organise and access photos quicker/easier than scrolling forever 2023..ditto
"I love the app's user-friendly interface, which allows me to easily create and post stunning photos and videos for my followers. The latest updates have been impressive, with features like Reels, IGTV, and Stories providing endless entertainment and opportunities for growth. The app's algorithm ensures that I consistently see relevant content on my feed, making it easy to discover new accounts and connect with people worldwide."
App has been much slower since the latest update. Everything takes forever to load. It's been nightmare. Not too sure whether the new update was there to fix bugs or introduce them. This has never happened before. I've deleted and reinstalled the app several times and the issue continues. Thought I was the only user but several of the recent reviews Ive read reflect the same issue.
Instagram is the best. I love watching all the awesome videos that people put up. it's amazing to see all of the things going on in the world and you can see it right here on Instagram. the most awesome videos in the world from people doing awesome stunts too. people flying jets at mock speed. so awesome! Instagram is definitely one of my favorite apps. thank you guys!
"So randomly features that I've been using for years won't work anymore, you know how you add music over a picture to post on your story, that feature is gone now suddenly, then it was the add 2nd picture button that disappeared and now I can't add pictures to my reels, I'm getting frustrated with it. I used to be able to pick a photo then put the amount of time I want it there for and then the next photo and so forth, now I can only add 1 photo."
The best social media app you can get on phones with low RAM or storage. It works smoothly on mobile with many smart features.I would suggest this one for everyone as it is safe and easy to use.No kind of problem or issues can be found in this one.
"Even though I rarely use it, I can say that this app is actually good. I love the filters, and also the visual of the chat area. Though I'm still sad why I can't make the duration of the song in my story up to 30 secs."
"My instagram account @susanti_____ has been suspended, even though i did nothing wrong. I have entered the data correctly. I've been waiting 4 days. Always shows up"" we're reviewing your info"" It's not about followers, it's about memories. Please solve this problem. I'm done !!!!! Nb: previously I have given ⭐️ then after writing this review, my account is back. thanks, I will give ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Every things instagram is awesome... but now a days don't know what happened but I was totally enable to just. Double tap and open a reel... It goes on increasing as I tried to do so but I failed. I request instagram to improve it or your users will be decreased day after day. It's totally wierd.😏😏
Brilliant very entertaining and definitely would suggest to others to use. Any topic just type in and ya have several different options o just one topic to u can follow or ya can make friends also on it.even send pictures to others like tinder.fb. so yes brilliant in my opinion.
"It's a good program, hello, there is a program called pinetwork (pinetwork), download it, and it's like bitcoin, you can extract pie, you can extract pie without using the internet, it only uses you to install it, and your phone will work again if it's turned off. Now, phase 2 is 60 years away, phase 3 is coming and the price will be set, and then you can extract more pie and sell it."
"My name is shubham I am from balrampur. I would like to give you some information about instagram. As all of you know my friend instagram is most popular in this world. This website is so good. Many people used this app I also use this app. In this app provide many types of filters and you can use any filter. You can make reels with trending songs. You can post your photos with song. I like instagram so much. I want to tell you, you can't use wrong word in instagram. Because instagram is good"
It's a very nice opportunity for people to be famous. I liked this app very much. But two problems is i don't have any swipe option in message box and i don't have any option for gift box message
"I love to use Instagram. It help me to keep attached with the world, trends and more. In Instagram keep our memories as a post and highlights. I love it so much I just have little bit problem as well and I want Instagram to look into these matters. Instagram would not give permission to such cheap video and that video who spread violence🙏"
"Instagram is very good and simple app for sharing pics as well as videos. You can share yours personal pics and professional ideas. You can make funky, funny, educational, motivational, spiritual, children, lifestyle and many more videos with number of topics. You can share funny and good reels and posts with your friend and family in their personal chats and also make grups that make you easy to share anything. You can tag yours friend anywhere in post, reels, story everywhere."
It is amazing but you should also install dislike option and also the maximum length of posting story is 15 seconds from insta you should extend the length of that . I explain again that when we apply song on our story so that is just for 15 seconds which is disappointment I guess 🙂 although it is mind blowing 🫶
"A great way to post your companies products or find a way to show the public your talent. Kind of like facebook but a different platform. Your posts and comments are still probably saved in a giant computer system like pretty much everything on the internet, but that's pretty oblivious now... Sorry but maybe it's all for a good cause? I haven't figured out yet..."
"It's a great app but still needs a ton of work. Scheduling, better account switching, easier way to find the thing you look for, the music suggestions for stories, etc. There are a lot of things they need to update but they just change layouts and add music to posts and try to change the business suite but screw it up and make it clunky to use."
"It's a good networking app. It's the best and useful social media app for artists, creators to reach a wide range of audience and to influence people and creating an impact in the world. It's amazing for visual creatures. It gives a good experience."
This app is absolutely amazing I started using Instagram 1 month ago and I already have 60 followers and my friends and family who don't have sim card can use to send me messages and calls it's absolutely amazing. And if u open professional account and only upload reels u are able to become a bit popular very fast! I recommend everyone to use this
The app is very nice. One thing I would like to request Instagram is to please add a rearrange grid option because I'm a person whose never happy with my profile arrangement. If you could add that option then I could make my profile look a tidy a bit cuz sometimes post Colored pics and something in monochrome. So the pics are making profile look untidy and I just don't like it please do it ASAP. I will be very thankful if you could do that. Besides this overall all app is very nice. Thank You...
"If you're having an issue with the home screen being just a white screen, or the app randomly closing, you have to wait for an update in order for the issue to be resolved.. Edit 3/24: Thanks a ton for fixing the app! My Instagram works fine again 🫡💖"
"Thank you guys. But the little issue I'm having here is the fact that I can't post anything without using pictures. It's not always one has to post anything with pictures, there must be some days to decide posting only texts. Please try looking into this for rectification. But all the same, It's a great app. Please keep up the great work you are doing and Thank you once again."
"I love that this app is more picture and video sharing (good vibes) VS facebooks constant drama and people ""venting""all the time. So far I haven't been put in Instagram jail so I'll give it 5 stars. Until I get put on restrictions or something.. then I'll be back to change it lol. But for now, good app!"
"Instagram is a very beautiful and awesome app. I really love it. But I want to call your attention to something. The posting place where we get to add topics, it would be really nice if a topic involving ""family"" was there too. I was going to post something family inclined but couldn't find the topic there."
"On home there are multiple options like search , create your own post and my account , it would would have been better is saved posts was on opening screen qlong with these options and in saved post we can make multiple genre / folder for saved post but there no criteria to sert them by sort by - alphabetical ascending order , if it was it would make the experience much more manageable"
"Great for personal use, professional use either to socialize or to promote your business, products. I used it for both my Youtube channel and for my restaurant and really it was always a great tool. Instagram represents the apex of the era of social media influencing we are currently in. Instagram can boast one of the largest user bases of all of the social media apps.... 😇😇"
"Great for sharing photos and videos with friends and family. Great for meeting new friends and finding family, classmates and coworkers. You can also video chat or make private calls without the video chat. I love IG or they call it ""The Gram"". I would recommend this App to anyone and give it a five stars. I wish I could give it more than five!!"
"Instagram is app where I spend my most of the time at, scrolling down the memes it's all fun using this social media platform, but their are some bugs, like, if click on a link which takes me to browser and when I later come back, the app doesn't work properly, I think instagram should add more features like extending the poll to more than 2 columns and comment section polls (polls which can be held in a post by just commenting down your choice)"
"After few days of posting reels on Instagram, the music added to the reels was deleted by original content creator and reel has no sound or music. Please add editing option to the reel post, so that we can choose and add different music to the reel anytime."
"This app is honestly so great! You can meet new people, text friends & family, make your profile to your taste, show people who you are and what you're into. The only thing I wish they'd change is allowing us to change our post covers. But other than that it's really cool and you can search and follow anything you want. 5 out of 5 stars. I really love the new notes updates and all the updates it's coming with."
The app is amazing and all but please make an option to turn of reels ...I literally can't focus on anything and that's just making me delete insta for a lot of times...so as a humble request plz make an option to turn off and on reels for everyone !.. Thank you
"What can I say; the experience on Instagram is vast... The app itself has become real user friendly; in the sense that it goes above and beyond to accommodate the user .. I have yet to use the business functions of the app... But go @morbid007 see whats new or what's up with me, the guy himself.. as an artist I should have something to sell, or portray for interested buyers and seekers of gnarly, funny, and moving stuff... Soul stirring is what I seek to achieve"
"I Highly recommend this app to all girls user, this is the only one app that you can be able to earn money if someone's calling you. You can earn beans wich is converted to $ , if you looking for extra income you can try this app."
"Ive been in this app like 2yrs from now, and i meet a lot of people and a friend, ive been cash out on this app many times and it helps a lot in my needs. Ive been recommend this app to all of my friends I know.. pls keep updating a good experience for the host and please keep away all those bad people who wants to ruin the reputation of the hostest. Keep spreading Love ,happy and earns a lot"

"I really enjoyed using this app, because first of all you can meet a lot of different people around the world anytime and anywhere. Its also user friendly and easy to use, just one tap of your finger you can meet a new friend around the world. I hope that we can access our msgs while doing our live so we can see their msgs as well at the same time..😊"
"Since then I learned about this app and I tried to use, my stress was reduced and relaxed myself even at home. I do not expect that I will have new friends not just here in my country but also nationwide. Another fun in this app is possible to earn you because of your communication or talking to your friends. So i am very grateful to who make this dating app because of the proper system. So if you think you are boring at home try using this app and it will definitely change your life. Thanks.💖"
Overall very outstanding experience! Ive tried way alot of dating apps and so far this is the best way to meet new and interesting people not just in my country but from all sides of the world. I have social anxiety and this app helps me to build my confidence esp when talking to men. I love the cam and its beauty feature and they way it enhances my look thus helping me to get callers. So far so good.
Hide and unhide option for the name of the user is not working under Gifting of each gift. . It's just freeze what's on last time.. Please enable the old switch back so that we can control hide or unhide.. Please keep an Icon for messages to check all messages from party room as well as live.. That will helps a lot.. Otherwise we need to exit from party room to check all the messages..
"This is a really good app i meet lots of people, doing conversation.This easy to use, but there is a some problem with frauds msg."
Don't have much information about but I think so 🤔 that it is everything.
Awesome.! I would give 5 stars and i like the concept. This app could be better. Very outstanding i ve tried way alot ao dating apps and so far this is the best way to meet new and interesting people not such in my country but from all sides of the world. Some of them cost 1000./ minute Or if the user can without charging after buying diamond land enjoy every time to talking people . And we enjoy the time in friends with share talks if you want be happy person with wants friends.
the chamet very nice and vedio talk beautiful but h chargeable Very nice good work
"Ive been using this app for almost 3 months now. Overall i am satisfied with the app, the user interface is neat and very easy to use.

But overall 5/5 stars. Nice app!"

Very very good app video cal the best app chamet
"Really entertaining app. It's useful to make friends on here around the globe. but, several times the app crashes if it runs in background of Android device, I'm hoping for a patch soon."
Nice app🙂 but please battery consumption and internet consume more in 3 hours all 1 gb complete please fix it.
Facing some problems with app. Daily rewards and monthly rewards are not crediting even after recharging
excelnt ۔great app i love this i have already agency on this app
"This app is very useful and helped me a lot, but there is no way to delete posts as far as I am concerned. If you have irresponsible people using your website, this can be exploited. I also found that you can put in a fake email, and it accepts it. Other than those 2 issues, this is a cool and easy app to use!"
Very very good experience .i used this app last 2years with no problem .highly recommended .very friendly to use.beautycam for this app is too good for girls❤its really magical transformation .the voice quality is too good .thumsup for graphic team and support team keep it up thank you!!!!!
For my opinion about these apps. I can say that its very nice apps that can help me save even a small amount of money. I am training and to accumulate a lot of beans. It's fun because you can meet and see people from different countries. There is good talk and there is also rude but it 's okay because I know that is the purpose of these apps.
"Its a great app to meet and mingle with different people around the world.. Lets you earn, play, and meet new friends.. Hopefully the amount of diamonds will reduce its price in the future as i am always doing a recharge and play games and also when its update of make up filter, the app is so lag when doing go live."
"Nice app everything about this app is perfect the free calls free messages well done, do more than these"
"I really enjoyed using this app, because first of all you can meet a lot of different people around the world anytime and anywhere and all user is friendly and easy to use just one top you can meet a new friend around the world"
Chamet app is great .you can be friend with someone. You will meet lot of people from different countries.its nice.easy way of meeting someone to be a friend and good listener on my all time stories in life ..☺️ I'll recommend this app especially to my friends ..
It's a legit and paying app ..thanks a lot GodBless! Thanks to the developer and to the chamet team ! It's also help a people .who also needs part time job like me ..thanks 🙏👍 a lot !it's really good and easy to used !
The app is very good and fun but one downside is that you can't talk to anyone for a long time with a free card for more than a minute if it can be updated a little it would be great
"Worrst app. I don't suggest anyone to use it. It wastes your time, data, money & energy as well. U can't reach even at level 1 until u buy diamonds. Call rates too high. This app causes device overheating which damages device very fast & consumes lot of data very fast. This app always try to reach to your privacy. So please don't try to use this App 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
full on entertainment
Very nice this app then we happy clearety camera
Nice apps. I used many dating apps..but this one is real good..you met real people here not fake coz you can see them live or in calls..I met here many guys and I friends with them. Nice and easy to used this and you make some fun and more friends and of course having a good relationship. Keep it up and add more games. I top up always for the game ahaha..lol..
"Chamet is good :) even though i loose much on betting but it is really a good application, meeting new friends at the same time learning their languages is fun.. thumbs up for the Hosts also :) i highly recommend this application to everyone :)"
"Hi chamet 😊 I just wanna to share my story here why I join this and why I really like it. First I have a lot of friends to the other countries I enjoyed talking to them making me laugh every day, Second I can practice my knowledge of skills through to them I learned more English, I learned how to speak in English or the other countries. And the third one is though to this apps even I have work you help me through financially, and I really appreciate it ❤️ . Thank you so much"
Look like a amazing and interesting 🥰🥰🥰😘
"Seems better now. Was confusing a bit b4. Under rated really when you see the amount of lessons. I like the program & multi language options. I don't like the heart system. I don't feel it motivates me when I get cut off in the middle of a lesson. Otherwise fairly good. Some things are not always correct translation, as in idioms."
"As a complete beginner to the new language, Duolingo has been fantastic. The repetition is very useful to memorization, each level builds on the last, the app is smooth and fast. I find it to be much more useful for beginners than Babbel, which gets too complicated too quickly. A couple things that could be added is a word list and stories (not every language has them). I appreciate that the old discussion threads were left in. They are very useful."
"Been using the app for 5 years now, recently upgraded to duolingo plus. I always have enjoyed it, but I really wish that I could have a little more focused lessons. If I could have the option to select lessons that were completely speaking/ listening exercises, or have access to some grammar articles outside of a lesson, that would be awesome. Update: focused speaking and listening exercises have been added, and it is fabulous. Thanks Duo team!"
"The free app has a comercial after every event or practice or lesson. I like the app but i was ready to give up for the commercials. I took advantage of the free two week trial for the paid version. It is much better with stories to listen to, practices, reviews, a place to go over your mistakes. For me that paid version doesn't fit my budget at all so I'm trying to learn all that I can before the trial is over as I don't know if I will be able to afford to continue. But The app is great!"
"I love duolingo! It has helped me branch out and try new things, like learning a language. It has a very simple user interface and is very easy to use. I have no complaints, it's a very nice app for beginners, just trying to learn. However, it does not really dive deep into learning the entire language, more of simple/complicated conversations. I just feel it is TOO game-ified sometimes."
"I've been using this app, off and on, for about 8 years. This is only one of two apps I've ever paid for because I feel it is worth it. There have been many changes over the years, with the PATHS the most noticable as of late. The paths force me to work on a greater breadth of grammar outside of my comfort zone. Do know that I necessarily supplement Duolingo with travel, listening to music/shows in my target language, and free grammar resources because no one source will teach you a language."
"I do really enjoy duolingo. I have a few suggestions, though, if they're possible (japanese version) It'd be great if we had a simple list of learned vocab or each unit's new vocab. Also, learning the ru and u forms of verbs might help learning to conjugate them, not sure. I noticed on the ipad version that the little animated characters on the main unit ""map"" actually have a purpose; click them to test yourself and try to get all 3 stars. It'd be cool to have that on android as well."
"Currently using Duolingo to learn Japanese. So far, it's been a wonderful experience in learning the language. Only downside, is that there's no support or anything for questions pertaining to language structure. It's to be expected though since it's an app. You have to be self sufficient and do the research and be passionate about learning. Wanting to study independently, I love this app a lot."
"The Duolingo app is fun to use. It's a little too soon for me to say that it's effective, but the lesson seem right with a mixture of repeating words and phrases starting with the basics and expanding vocabulary. There's reading, writing, listening and speaking lessons. I do wish they had a way to review the words learned and also to see the verb conjugations and pronouns and other grammatical information instead of only. Always presenting it in an instructional format."
"I've been using this app for years. Some times I drop it and I don't study any of my languages for a while but when I'm ready again, I'm able to pick up right where I left off. Anything I've learned I've retained and it's fun. You can talk to people and actually read through a whole load of really helpful tips from either duo, other learners, or native speakers."
"I was nearly fluent in Spanish, but when I stopped taking classes, I didn't continue to study on my own. The adage ""if you don't use it, you lose it,"" is so true. The thought of starting all over was daunting. But Doulingo somehow sensed at which level I should start learning again, and it turns out that I retained more of the language than I thought. I'm excited to keep learning through this method and also reading books in Spanish while I read their English counterparts:)"
"Fantastic! Duolingo allows you to learn a language conversationally which is much more natural than in a textbook. I was terrible at languages in school. I like the methodology and am working toward comprehending the stories in the Duolingo podcast. I quickly became a daily user and find the motivations, goals, and reminders helpful. This app is great in both the free and paid versions."
"I really like the exercises providing doodling. I think that the repetition and voice analysis and stories of great ways to learn a new language. The owl reminder is so great to keep your consistent which is what is needed for you to actually pick up the language. I've only been using this about a week, but I feel all of the modules are extremely well put together and I've already learned a lot in one week. Duolingo"
"Fun and quick way to learn to read and speak German, decipher the spoken word, build vocabulary, and learn sentence structure. More immersive and observational style of learning, rather than rote memorizing of grammar. Repetitive review builds memory. You can make it more challenging by speaking all sentences and writing sentences before checking the clues."
"Duolingo modifies it's presentation of material very well. If you miss a word or phrase in a sentence, it presents it in another manner, until you grasp the intended word. Wish they would have been around when I was in school, I'd have taken more language classes. After a year, I'm learning faster and retaining more. A little practice each day is the key."
"This app helps me learn Japanese and Spanish. My skills have been so good so far and this is one of the best language learning apps I have ever tried. The others are just straight up garbage. And duolingo is the opposite. The good things are there are not a lot of disruptive and obnoxiously annoying ads which almost every app has ads , but if u get the duolingo membership , super duolingo , it is so cool. You get daily reminders to tell you it's time to practice. I rate this app 5 stars!!"
"So Far , So Good! I've been using the app intermittently so I cant say I'm even close to fully saying full sentences but I'm starting to easily memorize your everyday words in Spanish. The colors and the characters are a nice lively touch , and I like that it reminds you everyday. If I had to rate it on a scale of one to ten I would say it's definitely as nice as my Spanish teacher from school lol ! Keep up the good work guys I appreciate all the work you've put into this !"
"I've had some time to get used to the (what I felt were very annoying) changes. It's not bad. I found that I can review by tapping on the heart❤️ and Duolingo chooses the lessons for review. I have progressed twice as far as I had in November, when the changes were made, and I am almost halfway through the course, now. I guess the course pushing me a little bit is working out for me. Thanks, Duo. (I still want the option to restart a course, though.)"
"Very good app for learning. The only downside is that it does not explain rules or basics, so the approach is really intuitive (a guessing game sometimes, and left to your interpretation of the rules as you go along in learning translations. It does explain SOME when you make a mistake several times). The approach to learning is fun and easy, though. No boring lessons. Would be good if they had a reference portion you can access if you want to understand grammar rules."
"Lots of language options, easy to use and understand. The game format and leagues helps keep it entertaining. Can be as active or casual as you like. Would be nice if there was more of a way to interact with friends, especially when both work on the same language, tag-team challenges so to speak, or where you chat to each other in the language for additional XP."
"Opinion on the newest update: I think the sectioning of the courses is very effective (IMO) because it gives you a clear goal to work towards, rather than just picking a random unit. Also, it gives some kind of explanation as to why the last 21%~ of a course is just personalized practice (percentage fact from the Finnish course). All in all I like it. The app I.G is very good, and I highly recommend it."
"I love this app. It feels so supportive of my journey to learning Spanish. I'm personally learning so I can understand my family better and be more included. I'm so happy to have found Duolingo. It's really easy to use and simple. I like the layout and all of the challenges to encourage you to learn more. Unlike other apps, even if you don't have Super Duolingo, it's not impossible to learn anything. Overall, it's just really great!"
"It's not perfect, but it is a great way to learn a language or to brush up on one. They contnually upgrade, which is nice except that you get used to how it works and then it changes. I have gone through 2 major changes while learning one language, and on one of them I felt like the change set me back, progress-wise. I miss easy access to grammar rules, verb conjugations, etc. But Duolingo is surprisingly effective even without them. A tiny lesson each day is much easier to stick to, too."
"As others have said, it's not perfect but they keep improving and the free to play experience is actually great. Duolingo wants you to pay for the premium version, but it doesn't push it too hard. My biggest complaints are that 1. the speaking option often just doesn't seem to work, and 2. the listening options sometimes glitch out and sound robotic. If I could, I'd still give it 4.5 out of 5 stars though."
"Love this app. Easy to use, go at your own pace. It doesn't take long to feel like you can communicate, though listening is a challenge. Unfortunately, only the most popular languages have the fun extras like story interpretation, and more in depth listening exercizes. I am still gaining proficiency in reading and comprehension, but it would be hard to understand a native speaker unless they spoke very slowly."
"So far, it was good. There arent too much ads, and all of them are skippable after a few seconds. however, ive been having a problem with the audio. It makes noise for whenever i get something correct, but when im trying to listen to the voice for the speaking practice the audio won't play, and ive even made sure that the volume was all the way up, but i still couldnt hear it. But, other than that issue, its a good app to have if you wanna learn a new language."
"Great for learning vocabulary! The app feels much better than a couple of years ago. The pace of learning does not always feel steady, and I don't think it's a one stop shop for learning a language. But it's definitely a useful complement to lessons. I feel like the difference between monthly vs yearly price plans is way too steep, so I'm sticking to the free version for now."
"Easy to use and funny scenarios they use in stories. I'm currently learning Spanish and French, and both are easy to learn, and really help you to get to your goal. It's challenging and fun at the same time. They have hard levels and easy levels. They have some ads, but overall an amazing app and teaching capabilities. A friend's kid was learning Spanish too off of Duolingo and soon we could have a small conversation in full Spanish in less than a month! Overall a great app."
"I love this app. The free version is great, I'm in a trial of super Duolingo and it's good as well if you want access to a few more features like competing for XP and practicing mistakes unlimited. There was an option that if you referred new users you could get super Duolingo for free but I don't see an option anymore. Please bring that back. I am already picking up words and phrases and know what they mean. Wonderful!!!!"
"Duolingo, awesome is the only word I can use to describe this app! It does have small little things that'd be great, but other than that, it's awesome! I'd kinda like there to be ""Activate Contacts"" so I could friend my contacts in the app! Just a request! I would recommend it for everyone! German is literally the easiest to start, or Spanish! Just a tip for starters!"
"I love using this app. It makes learning fun, easy, and challenging all at the same time (particularly for review). It has been a good way to re-learn an unused language. I like that it is interactive and easy-going. The free version feels just as inclusive as the paid version as well, which is very refreshing. I have been pleasantly surprised by all the various content this app offers. The functionality and aesthetics are also pleasing. Very much recommend."
Duo lingo is the best. Not just because I specifically enjoy it. They don't shove ads in your face and everything is free! There is an option to upgrade to premium but not being premium doesn't keep you from completing the course or learning languages. You can learn multiple for free! They're the only non-corrupt business I know of!
"The majority of language learning programs, especially big names like Rosetta Stone, are almost worthless for actually learning the language, but Duolingo works very well. You'll need to do a lot of review since the pace is pretty fast, but there are some review systems built in. It teaches by repeated exposure rather than explanation (although there are some limited explanatory pages available), so you'll struggle if you try to fit your target language into the mold of your native language."
"It is a great language learning app. But the only issue I have is that you have to pretty much almost yell for the app to hear you when they ask you to pronounce the sentence. But other than that it's amazing. So far I have started Japanese, Russian, and portuguese. And I'm confident to say when I want to learn a language, ""I start with Duolingo"" -Ethan an 11 year old learning languages on duolingo. (May 12th), by (June 1st) I'm hoping to read my first book in portuguese. Thank you duolingo. 😁"
"I haven't gotten into duolingo for a while, and I sort of don't understand much. It would be helpful if there was a brief summary of some advanced stuff I would likely forget, and It would also be nice if there was a little hint button for the first three days you come back after month or longer. But I never created an app to help people learn other languages so this recommendation is sort of a stretch."
"Duolingo has made it easier for me to learn Spanish. I like everything about the app, the curriculum, different lesson types, the social part of it, and that you aren't penilized for typos. If there was one thing I'd like to see in the app, if you could put in certain words or topics that you would like to learn about. For instance, my friend and I like fishing together, so if I could add a couple of words to the lesson like fishing, lake, pole, lure. Or add a subject like camping or outdoors."
I've only been using it for a few days but it is definitely helping me brush up on my Spanish Have been using it for a few months and have added two more languages. I appreciate the ability to switch between multiple languages at once. Only have the unpaid version and it is frustrating that the hearts given are as a whole and not issued per language but it does force use of more practice lessons and the reiteration helps my retention.
"Duolingo is a great way to get into learning a language. There is a sense of competition weekly, with fun goals and a playful sense of community. I've really enjoyed getting into it. I do feel this is more for conversational learning and is not as thorough as other language learning apps. The ads on the free version aren't annoying, as they basically promote Duolingo exclusively. I did find the 5 mistake limit a hindrance to learning efficiently, so I payed for the family plab. No regrets!"
"I tried a lot of language apps, but this is the only one I've stuck to because of the way they try and gamify learning. Plus it's free. If you just want to casually learn another language, this is probably the best app. If you need to seriously learn it, you might do better with something like babble bc duolingo doesn't explain grammar rules. But all in all, definitely a good casual language-learning app."
"I love it, it is so helpful to help me understand my in-laws better! I remember when I first started using the Duolingo app I needed to listen to the phrases in the shower option. Now I'm very proud to say that I no longer need to do that and I more often than not get 100%, until I have to write what I hear and I don't catch that a word had an accent in one of the words. But then in reviewing the mistake I can pick up on the slight accent in the word."
"The new version of Duolingo gives you a single learning path you have to traverse without getting to choose which of six skills you will work on. I thought I would hate the restriction, but it turned out that the single path also includes built in review of old skills/vocab that I was previously struggling to add that in at the right times myself. The friend challenges and daily challenges have also convinced me to work longer per day and I'm improving much faster than before. Really helpful!"
"Great app, the incentives and the way the rewards system works makes it feel almost like a game while also effectively teaching the language. As long as you actually put the determination required for learning a language into it, you can learn a language quickly (compared to how long learning a language would take without the app). Your doing a great job guys, keep up the good work! 😁👍"
"I have no complaints. I have had this app since 2019 and don't always use it consistently but find it easy to navigate, and a lot of fun honestly. I like the way in most exercises you can tap on each word to see the translation and piece phrases and conversations together. In the beginning it can seem slow paced but after a while it becomes a challenge. There are lives that run our after yoy make roo many mistakes, but you earn gems through successful lessons and quests, that allow you buy more."
"This app is great, I'm traveling in Spain right now, and I've been using the app everyday to learn Spanish. I love the new UI. It makes the learning a lot more streamlined. There are ads, but they aren't disruptive. I feel like I actually have a decent grasp on Spanish now. Some people aren't fans of the heart system, but I feel like it helps me be more careful during my lessons. Also, there there is a TON of different language courses you can take. Overall, this is a SOLID free language app."
"I love it, it's easy to use to learn the different languages that you want to learn and while the wait for more hearts is frustrating, there's the ability to refill your hearts to learn more. Plus if you want an app that doesn't try to make you buy premium or sign up. Then this could be an app you use to learn any language of your choice."
I absolutely love this app I've been studying Spanish for approximately 6 months now I can read it I can write it I can understand most of it my hardest part is sounding good and remembering how to use the past tense and present tense has but I'm getting there! I am going to do the podcast to help me become better at speaking I recommend it to anybody it's an excellent app I appreciate all the people that put their time into teaching us a foreign language thank you very much!
I enjoy it personally. It has some obnoxiously long ads on the free version but overall what seems like slightly monotonous repetition of similar routines actually builds a strong basis of recognition. Words I didn't know easily stood out to me after each lesson and I found myself flying through them. Later easily following conversations and slightly being able to respond in kind. I'm still working on it but I truly have learned quite a bit from a completely free app.
"Light, short lessons and stories keep things fun, and the daily rewards and streak counter are great for building a habit of consistent practice. (Streak freezes allow you to accidentally forget a day or two without losing your streak.) Heads up... you'll be missing out if you don't check out the podcast. Interesting articles from different countries featuring native speakers telling their own stories. Really fun and instructive!"
"If used on a consistent basis, this is one of the best language teaching tools I've found. The one year subscription is by far the best deal for the money, I now have 6 people I share the experience with included in the subscription. My only small gripe is that I wish they would have me interpret the sentence in the structure that it is spoken in the native tongue and not in the structure of English. But that being said it clearly works."
"Great app, been learning a lot of Spanish. The app really motivates you to practice daily with fun little exercises, competitions and reminders. At first I felt like I was practicing too much (so many incentives to keep going), but then I learned when you get the rewards that make you feel like you need to give it 15 more minutes & now I can find a good stopping point when I need to take a break, so it's not so overwhelming. Could do with fewer push notifications, but overall it's a great app."
"I started using Duo about 2.5yrs ago. I upgraded about a year later. I took a break & just came back & I'm enjoying the new look & format. I don't see ads because I use a paid plan, but they didn't really bother me for the time I was on the free version. I upgraded to get unlimited retries... Not sure if it is still this way, but if you got too many answers wrong you had to wait some time before you could use the app again."
"One of the absolute best learning apps I've ever installed. I'm currently learning Arabic, and I haven't had that many problems. I hate the fact that when I try switching languages, it takes a while to load. And some of the voice questions where you have to put which sound it makes is EXTREMELY difficult because it cuts off at the end. It may have a small impact on my lesson, but not that big of a problem. I love how there are quests/challenges. It's been 2 days and I can already read fluently."
"Doesn't throw too many words at you at once. Always goes back and reviews earlier lessons, but adds part of the one you are on at the moment too. Stories are nice because you can understand in the short sentences because of tone of voice. I do wish they had a slight more leniency with typos. And maybe conversations spoken a little slower."
"The app has updated and there's now some speaking bits! Learning how to say the words and the words lighting up to let you know if you got it we'll enough is excellent. It doesn't perfectly teach you grammar, but watching shows dubbed or in their native languages can help you figure out the grammar is conjunction with the app! Feel free to play your favorite games in your learning language, as well! It's not perfect, but it's free and helps a lot."
"Great tool but not a replacement for real conversations, you will get the hang of grammar and vocabulary but you will need to use it in real life situations to remember it outside of the app, and it is important to get a cultural understanding through videos and tutoring for more context. I enjoy the leaderboards and daily goals to keep you motivated. I usually spend 15-30 minutes a day practicng. I have been using the app to learn Korean and am almost at a 1300 day streak."
"As of now I have been using the app consistently for almost a month. I am learning Spanish, and am on unit 17. There are over 100 units and each one has quite a few lessons in each. The other day, I was watching a TV show with Spanish speaking actors and subtitles, no English translation, and I understood over 90% of what they were saying. Invest the time to actually learn, and you will ACTUALLY learn with this app. The free version is all you need, but the pro version has its perks. Recommend!"
"Very fun. Team quests, incentives, and rank advancement make this an easy habit to make. I really miss the little books though! Some languages are better developed to teach you to write foreign letters/characters. An excellent game with fun updates. But there is room for improvement; a vast work in progress. Every student should play this game. Wish they had more indigenous languages though."
"This app is captivating, well designed it let me learn in the most easiest way I ever tried. It has lots of subjects and levels and lets you know your own level. The free version has short ads at the end of every lesson so they don't bother me the screen is free of ads while you're learning."
"Because it makes learning a language a bit of a game it taps into the competitive juices. If not with others, with yourself. The way it works news words into my lexicon gives you clues as to the context. So it isn't just a list of words you're trying to memorize. Also the typing of the sentences helps to solidify context."
"Helpful. A bit more on the grammatical 'rules' of possession, plurals etc might useful. Not quite sure where I find this but i've felt my way through plurals by trial & error! Also not quite sure where to find Portugese accents for the written exercises. Only a beginner so this may become clear later. Fun and engaging."
"I absolutely love this app and I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone who wants to learn any of the available languages. My only complaint is that the daily quest system is a bit buggy. You may open a chest sooner than the game should've allowed you to, invalidating any chance of you getting the reward from that particular chest on that day. Other than that, however, if you like video-games and you want a gamified learning experience, this app is perfect for you."
"Duolingo definitely makes learning fun! I also appreciate the social aspect; there's only one thing I would add. I think it would be a neat idea to be able to send encouragement to our fellow league-mates! Something like a ""Hang in there!"", ""You're doing great!, ""I believe in you!"", ""Don't lose that streak!"" Pre-programmed response. I think I would be more motivated if I knew real people were encouraging me, and not just the automated notifications of the app!"
"I honestly don't get why this has become a meme. I have improved in my Japanese A LOT to where I can have full on conversations with my friends and family, the only thing that I did not like is that the hearts limit your learning but overall this is a really great app. EDIT, This app is amazing, i am now (pretty much) fluent in spanish as well. I've been on vacation in Mexico, and knowing spanish has really helped. Definitely recommend"
"Hands down the best free* language app. I poked around with a few apps before and never could stick with any of them. This one's different. I found out about this app through a co-worker, it has opened up opportunities for him personally. It motivates him to motivate others to join the app and learn. Today I just hit my 28 day streak. My goal is to hit 365 when I hit that I am going to double it. I cannot leave more than one review so I made modify with my progress."
Doulingo is perfect. It teaches you based on what you already know from the language you select. I recommend it and it also has a fun teaching style. The daily streak concept also motivates users to log in and complete a lesson every day. I personally love this app it is perfect. I will forever be loyal to Duolingo anytime I want to learn a new language. This is by far the best app for learning new languages and it breaks everything down enough for any age to understand. 💚💛 Duo 🦉.
"I havent learnt a language yet, but that's because of me, not the app. Anyway, when you choose what language you learn, you can select ""Start from scratch"" or ""I already know some of this language"" so if you already know a bit of Arabic, you can skip right through learning the alphabet and get right into the words! It says ""contains ads and in-app purchases"" but don't worry! They only play ads after the lessons, and the ads are just for their one thing. Anyway, its overall great app! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Duolingo has always been a convenient way to learn or refresh a language, but more as a support tool adjacent to more hands on language schools/platforms, but recently it has evolved in ways that challenge the nay sayers. There are conversations, podcast recordings, different formats of lessons, everything is dynamic and makes your brain think through what you are learning in multiple ways which really adds to vocabulary retention, and more fluid recall in actual conversation. Thank you, Duo!"
"I absolutely love Duolingo: the cute animations, the funny stories, and all the sound effects. Learning a new language was never so easy and fun. And we can even include up to 5 friends to my subscription. Additionally, the price for a no-adds version is fare, so I'm more than happy to pay for it and support the developers. Congrats, Duo Team!!"
"I had this a year ago and after 50+ days I gave up. The updated version is so much better, it took away hints from the characters, you can't just assume that is a boy when a girl. That helps me when I get frustrated, I still have to pay attention. I wish there were chapter vocab or flash cards to practice what you just learned, I may have not seen it, if that exists. But I have a habit of getting through the lesson, but not retaining a lot. ❤️ this app!"
"Duolingo is an easy to use language learning app. They are constantly improving this app's Spanish Lessons. The lessons include vocabulary, reading, listening and writing in short approximately 15 item lessons. Most of the little glitches are being worked out. Very useful app to learn a new language. I'd suggest a notebook and note taking to keep track of what you are learning."
"Great Experience. App is interactive, colorful and offers a variety of ways of learning your desired language. I especially like the timed exercises to see how many you can correctly answer in a set time. There are many modules in my desired language that you can learn basic words and phrases in no time. I look forward to every lesson."
"Duolingo is a very great language-learning app! However, I do have a suggestion: Flashcard Feature - You can see a word in one language and view it in the next. Match madness is a good version of this, but it would be great for a gem-free, not timed version. I like the new way of sorting things on your experience. Great choice on duolingo's part."
"Good tool for learning a solid foundation to continue upon. Some sentences are a bit unorthodox but they do the job in getting you to remember by repetition. This app is not magic, just downloading it will not make you a polylinguist, you must put forth the effort to learn and go above what the prompts ask you. Study outside the app. I wish you all a prosporus learning :)"
"This app has been very fun AND useful so far! I've learned quite a bit in 2 foreign languages now, as has my husband & our son! I wouldn't expect fluency out of it however, unless you already have a certain level of knowledge going in or are in a position to fully immerse yourself! But that's to be expected with ANY language app imo. I DO wish however that they'd go into grammar & sentence structure more so I'd have a better understanding of past & present tense, & WHEN to use which word forms?"
Great app for improving foreign language skills. I started using it after a work trip to France. My French skills had been collecting dust for 20 years. This app is helping me keep up my newly found motivation pour d'améliorer mon français. The repetition and intuitive exercises and learning method have dramatically improved my vocabulary and grammar skills in just a short time. Wishing I'd started before leaving for France.
"I enjoy the ease of learning this way however i get lost since all of a sudden a new verb pops up. Not many pertinent study guides to reference for congugating these verbs! I don't recall anything explaining the how to use app. I just dove in! Still do not know numbers, days of week, months, or everyday words i can look at like bed, tv, window, etc"
"Duo lingo is pretty incredible. It does an excellent job of teaching and refreshing my limited knowledge of Spanish. I'm not sure, though, if I had never taken Spanish in middle or high school, if it would work to learn entirely from scratch on this app. It probably would work well if used in conjunction with a beginning Spanish class."
"The app works great, with short ads that play after most lessons. Game lessons are engaging and casual to learn new words by reading, filling in the blanks, writing, listening, and speaking. Honestly, I have not been consistent and on it long enough to say it can fully fluently teach you another language. But it is helping me speak another language better that I previously took in grade school more than a decade ago. Duolingo along side practice in real life on a regular can result in fluency."
-I really recommend this app for learning a new language. -I've used the free version for quite a while now and I prefer it -I've tried the paid trial but I prefer the free version because I like the challenge and I it helps motivate me. -The ads aren't as overwhelming as most free apps. -I haven't encountered any bugs as far as I know. The app seems to work well. -The incentive of seeing your daily lesson streak increase provides good motivation
"This has surprisingly turned into a fun activity for more than half of my family. Nice competition and learning all the same time. Nothing beats immersion learning, at least for languages, but this is a very good job of helping multiple people in my house with different backgrounds of previous learning of a foreign language."
"Love the app! But i cant retry the levels! No matter what you do, levels cannot be retried! Once you finished them, they are locked with no way to retake them. But if you made a mistake, you can retry those on a seperate practice course. Everything is free but you have limited amount of mistakes before you have to retry the level."
"I love Duolingo so much. In my experience, it's a perfect way to steadily learn the basics of a language. I don't know if it's the best tool to achieve fluency, but it definitely helps you gain a basic understanding of languages for things such as travel, business and casual communication. Best of all, it makes language learning fun and exciting, so that's a win in my book. I think I'll always be learning (or refining) a language in this app."
"Duolingo has made learning Spanish for my trip fun! The example phrases can be useful and I like that Duolingo gives you the English translation (many language platforms don't). When you have the paid version you get tips if you get anything wrong, this is very helpful. It's easy to get my kids to do it because it's gameified and keeps them going. I wish you could pick your category of conversation for situations you will need. Ex restaurant ordering."
"So far, going great! Doing the Russian and Ukrainian courses. Lots of incentive to keep a good streak and perform well. Only complaint: could use a lot more variety in the sentences and exercises. They recycle a lot of material. Also, not recommended for mastering a language from scratch. I was already at a B1 level before I started the Russian course, which helped. With the Ukrainian course, I knew next to nothing, but my knowledge of Russian has proven useful. Prior knowledge comes in handy."
"Wow, my favourite language-learning app ever!!! It's SOOO interactive, instead of just telling you to memorize something. It's also a perfect tool for learning to read and recognize alphabets/scripts, comprehend sentence structures and basic grammar, translate, arrange and find missing words, plus waay more!!! It's got to be the most fun, interactive way of learning a language using a really supportive, fantastic app tailored to your current level of learning!!! I'm using it to learn Hindi✨🙂✨"
The game like design makes it fun. The fact that I can do it in short bursts helps because I don't have much free time. Also it tracking itself is helpful. I like that the way we get hearts is through practice because it still keeps you imursed in learning. This is all just through the free version.
"It's very helpful and teachful, but sometimes it just repeats things from a lesson long ago like, 20 times. Also, it might wanna work on the grammar. It also wants you to do the accents, but I don't have all of them. Overall, it's a really good app!"
"Absolutly 5 stars, So much fun and interactive, helped me learn Spanish language very easily. I recommend this app to all, it asks if you want to test your knowledge of that language or start from scratch. If you do choose duolingo prepare to have a blast. Well... I'm going to leave the rest a surprise!"
"It is a fun app, it keeps you motivated to comeback and do a lesson and it's like a game where you levelup bit by bit. No intrusive ads. Clean interface. Easy to use and flexible. Love it. My only complaint would be that the lessons can become repetitive. A more varied and challenging exercises could be added. Or atleast an option could be provided for increasing difficulty."
"Earlier this year duolingo was having trouble with speaking and listening exercises as well as stories. I'm happy to see that everything is now back to normal. There have been other changes as well and the jury is out on how much I love them. Overall I think duolingo is a great language learning platform, it has reminders that encourage you to practice, very interesting characters which are just fun, and really provides challenging and interesting subject material, great vocab and grammar."
"I highly recommend this app. Really well designed and functional. Especially if you are a complete beginner. It has really helped me get started with the language and learn key phrases, sentences and helps to motivate you as well with the leaderboards point system and streak. It has so many great features, it is also very encouraging which is really a key in language learning. It doesn't teach too slowly or too fast. And I'm only using the free version and it's great! Thanks Duolingo!"
"Fantastic app, I am absolutely loving it! It's really user-friendly and breaks things down into small, manageable sections that are repetitive to support learning whilst keeping things light and fun. It's great if you're planning a trip and want to get up and running, but also if you're returning to a previously learnt language (I studied very basic German over 30 years ago!). Have already recommended it to loads of people!"
"Speaking as a monoglot MA in English and Communication and 77 years old, I have found this very helpful with French. Clear, consistent, incremental, well balanced between speaking, listening, reading and writing and entertaining. It is sort of free, but somebody has to pay for it, so you have to excuse the occasional pay wall which you can navigate round."
"Really helpful to me as... I'm someone who travels a lot in different countries and because of that I need to learn various languages for communication purposes. And in that case Duolingo has been an great and awesome tutor.... It's an amazing app as it is so easy to use, the graphics and other features of app makes it very convenient for the learners to understand any language easily"
"This app is really very good for learning any language available. The best part is that it's free , but the only problem i see here is that the lessons and excercises sometimes become way too repetitive and sometimes not repetitive at all makeing us forget some words, also there should be a option allowing you to talk to your friends and followers there."
"Hi there, I was never good at taking the time to learn languages as I hated it in school. I've recently decided to give learning a language a chance and if you're the same this app is definitely for you. I have audio types for German and books but this app gets me to do all the stuff in one place from specking, learning to spell and reading all in one go in a fun interactive way. Out of all language apps I say this one is the best even my brother is learning a language."
I find the app very useful for revising my Welsh language learning. I use the paid for version as the free one places too many annoying barriers to proressing. The adverts aren't too annoying in the free version. For some reason the app sometimes refuses to load-up when I try to open it and I have to re-start my tablet to get it to work. Otherwise I recommend the app.
"This is an mind blowing app. I love this app so much! I am learning German and I liked it very much as- 1. No ads 2. It repeats the mistakes we made so we master it. 3. It has quests, which are quite fun. But I have a few things that need to be repaired- 1. Too much repetition. 2. No language letters. Overall, I would recommend this app for everyone."
"When I found out we were moving to France, I searched for language learning mobile apps and I found Duolingo among others. I found this app to be a more fun and a well thought out learning experience. Now, less than a year in France, I've been told by the locals that my French is improving well. I'm not taking any other classes and I have not yet completed the entire course, but I would highly recommend this programme to anyone thinking of learning a language from scratch."
"Easy to use, challenging, fun and genuinely helpful. I have tried to learn Spanish previously and due to having ADHD, I could not stay focused and used other apps that would not allow me to revisit old material if I forgot a lot of it. Duolingo has turned it more into a game and made it fun and easy as well as having a leaderboard and a streak so that I have reason to go back to it every day. I've been able to learn a lot with this app and I've actually enjoyed it."
"Cool platform to meet genuine people around the world but language is a very big challenge in communicating with some people. You guys should fix it up, maybe adding a voice translator or something. But its all good"
"Very entertaining. Never lets me down. I have made some life+long friends here. Easy to use as a studio, a dating service, or a bordum breaker. No adds, at least to my knowledge, within the app! Beautiful girls galore!!! They sing, dance, flirt, chat. Most importantly they chase the the blues off. Love you all"
Worst experience I have had with an app. Everything was cool and entertaining . But got i banned with out knowing the actual reason and I have appealed several times but it still not working. Help me get my account back.
"Th8s app is incredible for sharing time with other people who are also lonely and it's not about pornography it's not like that but I like to dance & my fans enjoy it or just putting my makeup on give it a try you don't have to anything other then sharing your free time with others. It really is incredible how it brings people together and hopefully helping other lonely eople helping our mental health. It's safe & fun to hang out together. Vtgank you Bigo you have something very special here,"
"It's broke. It keeps on saying I'm underaged but when I go to appeal it automatically says that's it's been approved but it doesn't unban me. Other than that I always have a blast, BIGO has a good crowd and the AP does a good job of keeping it from getting to seedy."
"It's good and all it's fun but the quality it's much better on an iOS device without wifi connection... They need to up their quality connection or whatever for the not so iOS users (android) but all in all , all stars 4 me"
This is one of my side hustle and I enjoy this app. Become a paid host. This app puts extra money in my pocket to take of my family. If you stay focus and consistent you would make good on here but you have to work hard it's not going to come to you if you don't put in the work.
"Pretty solid, all around way to live stream and make new friends. App tends to be completely full of drama and tends to break the bonds of close friendships due to conniving jealousy created from the app and it's ability to distance it's user from reality and degrade social skills. Other than that, not half bad of a time killer."
"I love this app, its fun, you can be yourself and meet some of the coolest people. Really worth having plus the bonus is you can get paid from this app, i mean real money"
Very good app when applied correctly there are some issues with customer service but eventually they get the job done overall a great experience!!!! if you're looking to find something to do there's always content for everybody and it is actually amazing the people that you connect with it's not like any other app out there. hands down this is the best app to meet and chat with people and the streamers tend to be very polite and open forums to discuss just about anything within the guidelines!!
"Awesomely relaxing app! Keep it up BIGO! PLEASE DO HAVE DISPLAY SETTINGS LIKE FONT SIZE AND FONT COLOR AND BOLD TEXT OPTION. Am only Tunnel Vision and I NEED SETTINGS LIKE THESE. SO MUCH. THANK YOU. BLACK BLACKGROUND AND WHITE LETTERS TOO. PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDNG !"
Bigo is quite a unique streaming application that allows people to have a go at streaming. Bigo helps individual to build confidence in presenting and in socialising. Bigo is a very general streaming application in comparison to other platform like twitch and so on. It can be additives and people should watch their spending while being supportive.
"This app is extremely phenominal! Of course, like everything else it has room for improvement. The opportunities are infinite. Not to mention the multitudes of amazing people I have had the pleasure of meeting. I utilize this app to share my experience, strength and hope with others to inspire them to exude there highest versions and to empower them to use life's lessons as their future blessings. If you decide to give it a try, don't be shy and stop by. Empress Kimani/Empress Ki The HP"
I have NOW been on the app for 2 and a half years. There are so many opportunities to grow and I love that I can be myself here even YEARS later. Thank you for capturing my moments!
"This is my favorite streaming app by far!! Best looking graphics, most amazing events and just an incredible place to go live and meet new friends!"
There's really no experience that I've had that's bad. Had a couple of sicko pervert but that's about it cuz most of it I'm doing live streaming and nobody really ever talks to me I had yes I had a black man decided he wanted to bring hate into the conversation and there was no need for any started attacking me he wound up leaving in a hurry cuz he realize he chose the wrong battle hahaha it wasn't because he was black it was because he was just filled with anger... Another words great no proble
"It's a great way to meet new/talented people from different places and cultures. Now, we have a problem. The African region can no longer get support from the outside regions. What is the point of being a worldwide social app, yet separating people from friends and loved ones?"
I have one of the GREATEST times on the BIGO platform. I network and communicate with others in many other places across the world. I would recommend BIGO to others around the world to try it out at least once. Learn the app and enjoy!
Performs well even on relatively poor internet. Need to unlearn the habit of scrolling up to wake up the screen it will have you leave rooms accidentally :) Good app and experience.
Love this app! Cool to connect with people from around the world. Lots of fun masks and filters. Love it all really nothing negative to really say at all!!! It meets all my requirements
I was introduced to bigo by my cousin.I was skeptical at first and reluctant to download the app but once i did I found I really enjoy the app and all it's cool updates. There's something for everyone rather you're an gifter/watcher or host bigo keeps everyone in mind. You can meet all types of people and find your Tribe. The live functions are nice for any type of event you want to stream or watch. Bigo is for everyone of age.
"I plan on spending all my Time watching Robert aka God Zeus. It doesn't matter what time it is,he's always has that smile that light up any room. Content comes as it goes,or what people slide across his desk. And his makeup tutorials are the bomb 💄👠👗"
"Love it!!! So far it's the only live streaming app that I have actually met people that live in my country and actually in my state LOL and although there are in app purchases available, there is no need to spend money if you don't have any or don't wish to, also their opportunities to make money!!!! LEGALLY 🤑🤑🤑🤑💯🌈👨‍❤️‍👨👩‍❤️‍👩👩‍❤️‍👨💑🌈"
I love this app. The only problem i have is that i dont understand why they come with that SUSPICIOUS VIOLATION and interrupt the show But in the same app THEY CALL IT COMMUNITY theres a more VIOLATIONS with those posted videos almost naked BUT BIGO DONT CALL IT SUSPICIOUS VIOLATION
"Changed my review format 1 star to 5. Bigo fixed my problem fast. I have so much fun on this app. It's boosting my business, creativity, and connections. The app has many great functions to have fun and make money."
I had a really great experience wusing this app I just wish the translate was easy to use also! other than that this app is great I would recommend to friendsthank you very much!!!!! DA.
This is an awesome app. I have lots of fun on it. Had a little issue. Turns out it was my stupidity. But all the Great people at Bigo live did a wonderful job helping me. I thank them all so cool Great app!
"I really enjoyed Bigo.I have met a lot of people from all over the world and interacte with them this place. Or should I say this app is amazing for those who don't know or are interested? Yo can learn a lot, not just Having an account,but you can learn so much in here. I never thought I would be where I'm at and never thought I could learn with others are doing and guess what I'm doing It thanks to these great people that are in here I appreciate Bigo and all the people whom I connected with."
Its real and easy to use and one of the best. Easy to creat an account and log in. Im in zimbabwe and its work very good. If you havnt download it uum plizz download it now and enjoy
This bigo live stream is a five star app it's number app online but sometimes it sucks the people on the online they are on games they came in your notification and when you go click them on they kicked you out for no reason and another thing it seems like some people scanned your it's give you a line when whey scanned and at times its sticks.
Literally sooo fun but addicting the very first time I went onto this app witch was yesterday now I was on it for 8 hours straight !!!! Really enjoy it rate this app very highly
"A great app where you can meet people from all over the world. All kind of talents, all kind of personalitys, lots of laughs and smiles everyday. I can't believe the progress I have made in my life from five months ago until now. I have found love I have found friendship and I found hope I cannot wait to see what else it has in store for me."
"Really I don't see such, quality, speed & easy in group or individual video communications app"
This app has helped me.. Really. I've met some really great people. Got me through some really dark times.. gained self confidence back that I had lost.
Really cool place to meet with people you'd never know existed. Alot of posts literally are random creators just standing there or doing chores off screen..but give it a chance because the creators that you are looking for are there and the chat you'll get attention if you're looking for that.
"It's always fun the interacting with often strangers at first! Is exciting and educational I do enjoy Bigo Liveand I love all the sweet friends I've had the pleasure of hanging with and all of the time exploring real people and being able to make a good friend from all over the world people you may never have meet or known if it wasn't for Bigo Live Thank You, LillBull N.W. NEVADA Ten miles to LAKE TAHOE CA. ""cumseemesometime"""
"this is the best live streaming app i ever encountered. When i play PUBG mobile while live streaming, it got no lag and pretty high quality.."
"Streaming, is fun. There's times, to also, development, positive pen pals, for feedback."
Became a host not even thinking I'd ever do this. They made it easy and hella fun and enjoyable. Great place for friends and to escape. Thanks BIGO. I hope to bring great entertainment vibes and all around positivity. Peace.
I like the comfort of being entertained and being able to entertain back but I seen people down to there knees asking for help wondering why sigh with no help but I think it a good way to mingle and have fun
Wow it's awesome but at least let there be ten to fifteen minutes grace for someone to fully express or show some interesting part of their body or nude before cutting them off because that's what makes many to stream this app thanks
"As with every app it is all about how we use it! It was built as a space for people to connect, to share experience, to enjoy performances :)"
"I love the app but i don't like the way you guys ban people on the app,they should be allowed to catch some fun.I always go to the app to catch fun but you guys restrict girls not to express themselves as they want to,they're there to make money,so allow them, rather put a restriction to the age limit of people downloading and logging in on the app. Please,allow us to enjoy ourselves to the fullest,they girls are there to make money and they willing to do anything to get the money so allow them"
"I thought this platform is only for something sexy, but when i got here i found different genre and different entertainment like music and singing and making friends. Thank you Bigo-Live😎😎😎"
This is one of the most amazing apps I've ever ever experienced it's so vast has a lot of options you can make money and network and just create a whole new fan base and experience that just moves you of course it's got its bad apples but as long as you leave those out you can be very prosperous I give it a five
Bigo is like only for girls but not but beautiful girls that I see in live so this app is great for me and I wish I will find my destiny here🤣🤣🤣 just kidding🤣🤣 but this app is better that I thought even very strict
I enjoy bigo live because actually have a chance to win real money. I used to be homeless when I got on bigo live I was able to provide for my kids my man and most of all myself whoever made bigo live not only thought about themselves they thought about others. I would most definitely recommend it for 18+
"Great app for friends,family,Extra Money or Promotion.... it's also a tough app if you can't handle all types of spirits or personalities..SO TREAT THE APP LIKE REALITY"
I have met some really cool people on here and found really good support system. This is now part of my daily life. I'm grateful for all the people and all the events and everything that goes with this app. I have cancer and coming on here is one of the things that helps me a lot it makes me feel less alone.
"Hi everyone❤️: if you filing lonely and looking for socialising,meeting new peoples and culturs it is the best one ever app +very quick response of customer service as well 🙏❣️ you never experienced before 💯 enjoy your life and time here"
Why did I download this app! It's great but I have social anxiety and well I'm not cut out for this! Also can't really find the right people to chat with!
Amazing I download this app by accident and I'm gald it happened I have meet great people and it has gave me my love for playing music again. Truly life changing app.
Good way to meet people from other countries there are a lot of fakes scammers but all in all it's a good app
At first I got so disappointed 😞 and thought that this app is not good but being with time I realized that it's actually depends on users how they use anything. Use or abuse . But it's my request that there should be some criteria for broadcasts .they might be educated.it will be in favor of BIGO s rapotation spacily in Pakistan. And there should be control over kick out anyone without any reason just on base of broadcasts mood . Hope I can get your attention by these words.

"Par for course,seems set up for failure. But it's hilarious 😂. The funniest thing ever.. lot of laughs , Godspeed 🫡"
"This app has my attention, not sure what to do yet but def something I will learn quickly because I love getting to know other people and their way of life."
One of the fantastic platform for meet new people's for new friends it is a easy way to find out good friends
I feel nice for this apps have a lots options to communicate and as beginner I'm still searching on how to work more. And finding some nice friends globally.
"I have never seen such app, with very awesome and easy way of meeting new people around the globe. The experience is superb as meeting new people get to be easier, a place to share ideas and even sale out your skills easily without looking for help. Easy to operate, as it is well designed with so many unbelievable features, which are mind blowing whenever these features are used. To attest to my words give it a try!."
"Nice chatting application .. Good time for everyone .. However, some hosts are way more interesting than others .. It's worth attending some hosts :-) Yesssss :-)"
As a new user I'd just fan of watching the live of some user's since still learning the process of the mobile apps.
"Wonderfull app , everything is there. Fun,social meeting new people ! The best. I meet a lot of friends because of bigo so thank you."
Bigo has changed my life for the better. Once you get to wrap your head around the functionality of this app. You will see that making money isnt so hard. This app is always improving to help the users. The graphic are simply the best and the earning potential is great. I have recommended it to so many people and will continue to do so. I am a real testiment of how great this app is. Visit my broadcast and I will gladly tell you in person....Bigo- Teasehost.
"Excited! Friends are coming very quick! ❤️❤️❤️ Though the idea is unknown, and you have to explore just to discover, still find it interesting 😍😍😍 Hello viewers ! Next time we can chat one on one maybe? Thank you for those who follow me! Promise, will follow you back🙏❤️ I don't know what will happen in the next few days but will stick for sure! Your new Host, Treasure 4ever🌹"
I Love it ! it's just that i jave a job in which i am inchafge of a three man crew and k have to be there all the time day and night I am always on call so there are times that i am very tired when.i get off work..
"I just started coming here recently, but I have been pleasantly surprised. I'm not used to any of these places. This particular one a decent site. I have already found several really good people here. Not that I didn't expect nice people, but I guess I thought they would be harder to find.? There are things that you can purchase, but that's entirely up to you. No one will be bugging you about anything! My favorite is Isabella, who works on thebb and r6 off the"
"I love it, I have aot of friends because of this app, I have friends in other countries, also our country Philippines, thank you bigo live, I hope you gave me money hahaha 🤣😂"
I'm thankful and grateful for the opportunity to meet people from all over the United States of and around the world on this platform thank you very much for the ones that created this App may God continue to bless you is my prayer. I love this App.
Very easy to interact with other people and it's is very much easy to use
Bigo is good plat from to play games with friends and sport to earnings method and all people excellent app
I love 💕💕 the app the problem there is the broadcasting they don't need to keep any ladies out let them feel free
"It's just what I need to fulfill my craving for attention, and the opportunity to really express myself.."
I can only say that this app is so fun you can make friends and anything you can also play something like that and that's it I like it it's so fun
"I love this app, it takes more challenge's and entertaining. Thank you BIGO💕"

"I really enjoyed this app, to show and share my singing talent during Live. 🥰😇 Thank you!!"
I've found different content on her every time I log on. There's a lot of good people with good energy on here and I have enjoyed the more mature chill vibes of most everyone.
It was wonderful I learn a lot I had fun that device was easy to use
"An Independent Broadcasters Dream. Developing n' Creating Content. An Evolving into Notoriety, Fame, Celebrity an Monetary Gain. All in Due Time. A Great Place to Meet All The Different People of The World's on Earth. Local to International. I'm Having Lots of Fun."
This is a good app for live streams and broadcasting..
"So fun! I'm having a ball just playing around w it after downloading it. It's easy to learn as you go! I just clicked on a template & ended up making a 3-slide, 20sec graduation announcement for myself! It's such a fun & versatile way to express your creativity & jazz up your photos, videos & social media! It's totally beginner friendly w lots of goodies even if you don't have the Premium version. I definitely recommend you go for it! Have fun! 💕"
"My absolute favorite app. As someone who is colorblind and in general doesn't excel at design, this app is a life saver. I can quickly put together professional looking graphics for my business. It is very intuitive and friendly for those of us without a graphic design skillset. Sometimes I just dabble with canva for fun and it makes me feel like I have some sort of artistic ability ( I don't lol). Highly recommend, well worth the cost for the pro version."
"This app is literally AMAZING I've been recommended it many times and I just started using it a month ago, there are many things to do, like adding text, pictures, colors, animations, litterally anything you can think of for an editor, here it is. I love adding effects to my text and making them look cOoL😎. I totally recommend to newbies, amateurs and pros. It makes editing SO EASY ! I can't find an app better, and YOU can't find any better. It's a video editor, which i don't use, but you might"
"Besides the fact that this app/website is one of the best free graphic design programs I've ever used, the support team is incredible! I accidentally forgot to cancel a subscription and emailed asking if I could get a refund (which they definitely did not need to give, it was my fault after all) and the team responded to me within the minute letting me know my money had been refunded. I would recommend this to anyone!"
"Canva is the best graphics app I've found. The functionality is a bit unintuitive, though it's because they cram so much into such a small space. It can be a little hard to find the full functionality of the site on the app, though it's there. It's excellent."
"I was having issues with the text boxes adding new lines and the cursor jumping everywhere, but it turns out the problem on my end. In case anyone else has this issue: In my keyboard settings (Samsung) I had to disable ""Suggest text corrections"" and ""Enhanced accuracy"". The app works well, app support was very responsive to my concerns, overall very good. I usually don't leave reviews on apps but this is an exception."
"I was having technical glitches, but it turns out it was a Samsung issue with the keyboard auto-filling and not the app at all. Customer service was very helpful. This app is amazing and so easy to use on my device. All of the pro options I pay for are easy to access and use. I am constantly creating on it!"
"Wow! I love Canv's capabilities. I'm in an Indie Rock Band. I am also the band's designated artist/designer for album covers, single covers, Videos, YouTube covers, etc. I've tried quite a few other apps. There is nothing that comes close to Canva, for ease and flexibility. I'm new at it and have much to learn, but, it's coming easy. Very user-friendly!"
"Easy and very easy to use. Affordable with great features and updates all the time that actually improves the app instead of making it complicated. User friendly and adaptable. Fun and supportive, I love the encouragement and achievement reminders. Saving process is the best. Works well on Android. Experienced no problems with the app software. It's professional yet also very bespoke so you can easily tailor functionality to your needs. A great experience. Makes life easy."
"I enjoy using canva a lot, it has so many great features ranging from all sorts of designs to video editing, text to image generator, i can't just mention it all here, the most beautiful thing is that the interface is user friendly and the price is very affordable. I have never come across such an amazing product before... Kudos to the developers 💯"
"best canva User-friendly interface: Canva' interface is intuitive and easy to use, even for those who have little to no experience with graphic design. The drag-and-drop functionality makes it easy to create professional-looking designs without any design skills. Wide range of templates: Canva offers a wide range of templates for various types of designs, such as social media posts, posters, flyers, business cards, and more. This makes it easy to get started and customize your design to your l"
"Canvas is graphics simplified , it's simply incredible. 3 more faetures can make canva more excellent #Real 3d text, 3d objects & 3d background which implies adding perspective rotate. #Gadient Coloring for text and objects #Direct Printer sync/ projector sync. #Lite offline version for note taking on phone. @EDIT Almost everything is done, Powerful AI tools but I really plead for one more thing, it's really headache to some of us, PLEASE ADD MULTI COLORING ON TEXT IN THE TEXT BOX. PLSSSSSSSS🙏"
"even in the free version the function of the app is still very good, the templates the smooth trimming of videos and fast download of your design is just too good. For me the devs really put their best in this app so I might consider going for the pro version. but I need some testing to do first, before that."
"What an incredible app! I've saved SO MUCH TIME and MONEY I don't have getting a design I want, not only that, but im able to test very quickly and on they fly different options of how it will animate. I made a logo for a business idea, usually I would burn out pretty quick in this area, but instead Im dialed in and stoked going forward. I can tell Canva and I are going to have a very long and strong friendship! CHEERS!"
"it is an amazing app! unlike other apps, it makes everything easy to do. A few years ago, I was trying to find an app which can help me do editing easily, KineMaster etc looked very hard. Then I found Canva. it is truly a good app! It has good fonts templates and i absolutely love the every week challenge where you are given a topic. Thank you!💫"
"I'm impressed!! Canva has more content creation features than any other app I've used. I was able to brainstorm and complete my first flyer within minutes, and it looks great. Magic Write is a useful and convenient feature. Great job on the UI/UX!"
"I Love the Canva application to learn more about designing, poster making, PowerPoint presentation and may more! This applications can be used in Home, School, Offices and even in Furniture usage quality! Even in factories we can use, for editing, javascript, Python, In Cricket to make it look more fantastic. This application can be found in Google Play and The App Store! I think it can be used to make ppts and presentation, even for Arts and Craft too! We all together make changes on the best!"
"Canva is a changer in the world of graphics. The concept graphics on the go has made content creation easier. As a creative teacher also, It has assisted a lot of my students in having the required confidence to venture into content creation. My 100% recommendation."
"I can't say enough about it. Use it multiple times a day. Quick, easy to use and saves small business owners hours and hours of labor by being able to accomplish amazing, high quality images and videos right at your finger tips. the templates are life!"
Canva is one of the best designing app I have used. I will suggest everyone to try it at least once. It provides a variety of outstanding features specially for graphic designers. It is also very user friendly. Great work by the developers.
"I think it's such a great free editor, it glitches a bit other than that I think it's just perfect for me as someone who works a lot with graphics. It's a bit tricky to nagivate for but once you learn works like magic."
"Perfect for students. Some bugs from time to time and that makes the experience somewhat worse than you would have compared when you are using a desktop, but still good and very helpful."
"Long time member, and it's my favorite! Go to when making my music videos, presentations, social media posts. It has everything you need to edit your content! Amazing app idea, it's the all in one."
"too many professional and quality of life features, and for free the only stuff hidden behind a paywall are things that require ai and software on their end, but everhthing else is free. even notes and a comment section for the singular effects (which they have for some reason) im new, so even if there were problems i wouldnt notice them, but really recommend this software. its the most user friendly free software with the most features"
"Very good,I Uninstalled it once for personal reasons and installed it again it didn't need too long to recognize my device and took me straight back to my profile and everything was still there,incompletes and completes. I love the app 10/10 definitely would recommend this for everything graphic"
"I've been using Canva for 5 years now, and the experience for me has been one progress to the other on the part of the company, with the services and ease of use being well improved with time. If you're looking for an app to also help you professionally and easily improve and do graphic design, then Canva is your app."
"Very glitchy after the Canva Create launch! During photo editing, in 'Adjust', the sliders/buttons don't respond! When adjusting one of the properties, it displays the 'Design' menu. I am using Samsung Galaxy S8 Tablet, interacting using either by tapping or using the stylus. [Update March 31, 2023]. After an update, the app went back to its usual self. Lost 4 days of productivity, though. Still like it!"
This app is amazing and near flawless even on smaller mobile devices like cell phones. Many times design apps will not be able to offer the full range of options on hand held devices but after the latest round of upgrades Canva can operate just as well as on a computer. It is well worth the money for the paid version as this company really delivers on making sure their product is not only high quality but user friendly.
very nice app. I love photography but i wanted an app which can make my photos look more aesthetic. so basically I loved to do aesthetic photography. so this app helped me really well. the only problem is that it takes too much time to download the image in my device. maybe in other devices it does not take that much time.
"It's been amazing using this app to create. Very equipped for all my needs in design. Easy interface to achieve complex results. A lot of awesome templates. Best of all, no ad pop-ups. Thank you Canva crew."
"Canva just makes things easy. As a Photoshop user, I struggle at times with the simplicity of Canva, but as a tool to empower a team to make designs it is amazing. I am learning more each time I use it and it's definitely a win for team use."
"I really love this app... it allows me to be more creative and it is very easy to use. It would be nice if you guys can create a function to manipulate the shape and size of the typography, it would be instrumental when creating logos. Please consider."
A great to; for the novice and creative types. It can produce greate reasults and is easy to navigate. Lots of excellent tutorials are avaiable to guide you through small to large projects. Highly recommended!
"This app has been amazing, it's free it's easy to use and instead of having 7 different apps for similar things all i need is Canva and it works better and it's simpler. And it doesn't give me a headache on mobile like other apps. The link sharing and downloading is simple and i do all of my digital school work on Canva now and I also love it for my personal non school related use. This app has saved my butt so many times and it's a holy grail to my grades. Thank you for making this app."
"I don't know what I'd do without Canva... I use it all the time to create many different things from resumes and CV's, social media posts and headers, to logo's and branding. It's a great place to start and somewhere I always come back to. The free subscription is great and will suit many of you but with premium it's much better - more images, more templates etc. Suits everyone from someone updating their CV to business owners needing professional documents to social media creators."
Canvas has been a great app Have been using the premium version for a sometime now. It's amazing. You can't miss out from it. It make your graphic design easy and faster I recommend it to you.
It's an amazing app it helps with your school work and when you write you don't have to make a full on textbook just to write and that's what I love about this it just makes it easier and you could also do basically the same thing as Google docs but better! You can also make wallpapers (just get a portrait) and then download it see easy!
"Android app is great and always has been. You can go from editing a graphic intensive resume to editing a simple promo website - all in the app. Just like the iOS app. It's great when a company keeps their app designs consistent! I've always been a mobile power user and Canva is such a key piece of my toolkit! Also, their premium plan is ridiculously accessible enabling me to cancel other creative service plans and allocate that budget to more meaningful things like an OpenAI subscription."
"I really like the app Cavana! It's a great way to keep track of my daily tasks and to-dos. I love the user-friendly interface and the ability to customize the app with my own colors and designs. The reminders are also really helpful and make sure I don't forget any of my tasks. I also like that I can easily add notes and photos to each task. Overall, I think Cavana is a great app and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs help staying organized and on top of their tasks."
"I recently began utilizing Canva, as well as I'm currently crazy! It's so very easy to make use of and also has lots of functions to provide you full control over the feel and look of your layouts. The totally free design templates available are terrific as a beginning point, as well as the capacity to individualize them is absolutely incredible. Whether you're developing leaflets, posters, social networks article, videos, or logo designs, Canva has everything you require to make your jobs attra"
"Love it. Just wish more graphics were free and not premium as not all of us can afford 40,000 subscriptions per month. I just have too many bills to justify buying premium as this is a hobby. If it was for work and I made money from my designs I'd be able to write it off as an expense of my company. But until then... I'll just use the free stuff. 😊 💚"
"My updated review: I love Canva! It's intuitive and extremely user friendly. A couple years ago I left a 2-star review as the mobile version of Canva was difficult to navigate and glitchy. I'm so impressed by and grateful for all the updates this app has gone through, and appreciate all the work that must've gone into these changes. Thank you for this outlet for my creative process!"
"To be honest, as someone who is an art prodigy in drawing: Canva helped me in the pandemic by helping me work on my digital art and graphics. It was really relaxing and therapeutic to be sure. I just hope they have more of those cute Y2K 2000s K-pop presentation templates. They look so colorful and the possibilities are endless, for real bro, give it a try. Trust me."
"Easy to use, even for technophobes! Fun designs, wide variety of free choices and options to upgrade for taking it to the next level. Love it!"
"The best program for flyers, book covers, and advertising hands down! The mobile version is easy to use and it already has your projects. You can create YouTube thumbnails and so much more etc...."
"Used to be a premium account, happy at first but ended up dissapointed coz everytime i ""download"" file whatever file extension that is, it keeps me forever to download and success rate is too low, i always screenshot my final draft and unhappy with resolution outcome. Unsuscribed and just continue free."
I love this app I have over 500 designs and counting I use it every day for so much it's the best designer out there with so many features for free and the paid version is even better. Never have I found thousands of fonts for free on any designer and never have I see such an in depth program that allows you to make so many different types of designs from shirts to websites to business cards to signs to social media posts and videos Canva has it all I as strongly as I can recommend this app !!
Canva is one of best editing software. The interface of the app is so cool. Easy to use even you don't need to use pc/laptop for editing. You can use all editing parameters in mobile also and that is another good thing in canva. Thank you team ❤✌
I think for an App that can produce such results with only an option of touch screen to get complex designs done is amazing. So far so good.
"One of the best app with lot of free features to give wings to your creativity ❤️ I really appreciate the auto save feature ❤️ and one can sync it on different devices, so if you make file on laptop, you can download it in your mobile phone also..! 🫶 I suggest to fix slow processing Bug 😇"
Amzing experience with this app. It saved my millions of seconds. There is one suggestion that canva must include audio and sound effects for videos so that it becomes easy for users!
"As a student, this proved to be a very good and useful but also simple to use app. Did not disappoint one bit and went higher than my expectations. Overall I highly recommend this as a great way to finish my infographic Projects and such. 👽🦤🌝☠️👺🤓👕💩💀🕳️"
"it's a great app. can edit at any time, anywhere. There's absolutely nothing I don't like. Especially free Editing which is great for new business owner to save a bit of cost until business is established. Then you can subscribe to Premium. Five Star to this amazing app 😍 👌"
"I Love Canva! It's such an easy way to make creative flyers, posts for social media, and cards/invitation. I also love the fact that you can create everything from scratch, or use any of the beautiful templates they have on file if your not in the mood to be be creative. I would highly reccomend."
"Canva - A wonderful app ,really helpful and simple enough for anyone to use. I highly recommend it to all ,go for it., you will more than glad to have it. Its'n amazing app for editing or making invitation card , pamphlets etc."
"Simply brilliant..!! I haven't seen such an amazing, user friendly, beginner friendly app for editing almost anything and everything! A 100% recommended! Even the free version is good enough to edit amazing videos and pictures and documents and create what not! superb. Highly recommended!"
"Best app ever for editing literally anything. I am now using Canva for my university, my business, my other personal works, and literally on anything. It really makes my work easy. But I would be really happy if a little bit of premium features were free😅. But yeah, you can still get your work done with the free features."
"My favorite app!! As a student and small business owner, I use Canva for just about everything. I don't think a day goes by where I don't use it. It is very easy to navigate and project possibilities are quite endless. I use Canva for making lists/print outs, coloring pages, invitations, IG posts, IG stories, business cards, etc. I even make designs on here to upload to my Cricut or to get printed out on transfer film. I love all the additional features included in the pro version."
For creators starting out the free version and it's UI is extremely useful. And if you're creative you can take advantage without having to pay for the premium version. But the premium version does have its benefits so I wouldn't mind trying it out since other creators on there are extremely skilled and you can use that and try to make it your own (as in edit it to show your own style in it).
"Had a technical difficulty a few months back where the system kept glitching making it very hard to work with, thier support team took it very serious and actually fixed it. I was impressed not only at the individual check ins they made along the way bit the follow through of customer care and concern."
"Absolutely love this program, and completely worth the pro version. The amount of graphics, templates, photos, and tools in one easy to use platform is fantastic. Learning cool new skills with it all the time."
My 1st with Canva! Learning what the symbols meant was the most time consuming. But once I got it... ZOOM!!! The templates are very nice and easy to redesign. Also Canva saves your work and you can start again anytime from whatever device you choose ( as long as you have the app😊). 5 stars is nice but this deserves 10!!!! Sheilah G
"I've been using this app for a few weeks now, and I have to say, it's the best logo maker app I've found! The interface is user-friendly and easy to navigate, and I love the sleek design. One thing I appreciate about this app is the level of customization it offers. I can tailor it to my needs and preferences, and the app remembers my settings. This is a huge time-saver, as I don't have to constantly adjust things every time I open the app. The app's functionality is top-notch, too."
"I've always using canva, it has almost everything I've ever needed when it comes to designing.... some of my best features are the way it saves your design even when you're not done with designing, it's very fast, and the templates are too good to ignore.... keep up the great work👍"
This app is so amazing I can't even deal. Beautiful content and so aesthetically pleasing. Big yes!!! I can create a stunning piece in less than 5 mins. So simple to use and I love the feature that lets you resize a design to fit different social media platforms.
"I have used this platform through high school, college, as an influencer, and now owning my own business. On the FREE option. 100% will upgrade soon as it does have more perks. But even on the free program, this platform has carried me through 2015 to now 2023 successfully. I've attempted to use other spinoff platforms, and this is truly just amazing and user-friendly. 10/10 recommend all the time and will continue to use."
"User friendly. Lots of images, you'll get lost playing with all the fun designs and features. 😆 Whether is be for business or personal crafting like Me, it's worth the 13$ a month. When I don't need it, it's easy to unsub and they'll let you finish out the month you paid for after canceling, which is nice. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Canva is an outstanding application! It's very easy to utilize and also packed with functions that help me design remarkable visuals. The personalized design templates are so valuable and it's wonderful to have the capacity to add individual touches to my developments. Very recommended!
"Canva has been the best discovery while planning my wedding! I have used them for my Save the Dates, Invitations, Christmas cards, and now my thank you cards. Everything is easy to use and personalize, the quality is fantastic, and the shipping is fast! I ordered too many invitations and customer service was amazing. And I absolutely love the ""every order is a tree planted,"" mission. I will continue to use them for all my design and print needs!"
"I love Canva. It's so fun to design my social media posts and more. When I can't figure something out there's usually a great tutorial available. If I'm still having trouble, the support team is friendly and helpful. Most of the time it is trouble free creating!"
"it is the best app in Play store. If you are a designer or not it needs to be in your phone. it does all your media work. Video editing,image editing, posters,flyers,menus just name it. the UI is also great and it's pretty much free 🔥🔥"
"Canva, in my opinion, is simply the best design app on the market. You can literally do anything & everything in terms of designing logos, letterheads, email signatures, webpages & even editing video clips. Now that they've updated the payment method allowing full access to all their content, which is a BUNCH, it is more affordable. (Pay month to month when you need full access versus an annual subscription) Start-up businesses & people who want to dabble in social media apps, Canva is ideal."
"Everyday I am finding something new. it's such an awesome app. I have tried a few apps over the past month to see what has the all around best and Canva has got my subscription. I can use it on my computer or my app. it's amazing especially starting my brand as well as my new channel. Try it, you won't be disappointed. so much to choose from and to create. they give me all the tools to be me and more 💜"
"CANVA has been part of my creative life for more than 2 years. The App is easy to navigate across most platforms. The picture quality is perfect. It is great for work, entrepreneurs, school projects, content creation, presentations and so much more!!"
"Good afternoon. This is a wonderfully made app that is saturated with various designs and features. However, the only conflict users experience are: 1) One may experience slowness in the Canva app. and 2) Users aren't able to use ceratin designs and features unless they've paid for the Canva premium pro. Other than that, I highly recommend anyone to use this app."
"My experience with Canva has been nothing short of remarkable. It is the perfect platform for designing just about anything with its amazing tools and resources. Whether I am creating graphics for work, personal projects, or for fun, Canva is my go-to for fast and easy designs. I love that Canva offers tons of pre-made templates and graphics that you can simply plug and play. They also have hundreds of fonts, images, and icons to choose from to create the exact design that you want."
"Canva is so easy to use, Is FREE, and has no ads. I love canva for making posters and flyers. Although a lot of the templates and shapes use premium(which I don't have), it's still a wide variety of templates, etc. I would highly recommend."
"I've been using Canva for the last 5 years and looking forward to use it for more 50, hopefully. It had made my life much easier and helped me become self-sufficient in designing professional documents as well as personal digital elements smoothly. I don't have undergone any designing course but only because of Canva I can now design creatives like a pro. Sincere thanks to the team for gifting the world such a beautiful application which made our digital lives much easier as well as creative."
"excellent experience I am able to do many posters for my business. Creating resumes, presentation etc is too easy now. Highly recommend application. Easy to handle. Beginners can also work easily in this software."
"it's an awesome app. especially the new features! And on computer the bluish purple thing gives out glitter! Better then put. but only 1 request, just pls make premium things free! or if not give something like points you earn and then you use it, by buying with points or this is better,m you buy chances , from a small store in canva, and then you use your chances to do so and so using premium stuff"
"You guys have simply outdone yourselves with the app. It's basically like having Photoshop on your phone. You've got a plethora of features and new stuff keeps getting added. I'm a regular premium subscriber and this has really helped me design a lot of stuff for personal use, and my YouTube and TikTok channel. Had a few complaints before but it's all good. Keep it up and I hope you guys don't relent with the app's quality overtime."
"This app makes my life a whole lot easier as a designer, especially for designs needed urgently while on the road out of office.. thanks y'all 👌👌👌 can you please add an option whereby one can be able to modify a pdf document well please 🥺😁"
It's the best! The monthly subscription has opened a new window for my business. Everything looks professional after rendering and I couldn't be more satisfied. Excellent for album and single covers when releasing my music as well. 🥰⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"I'm a happy user and have been proud of how Canva grows everytime. The updates are fresh with the features I never expected would be here. It's an all-in-one app! The designs are stunning but sometime I confuse for elements that used random coded, so it's hard to find by keywords. Could you please make the Website available to make form like for survey and other purposes? And make Canva more 'drawing friendly' perhaps? Thank you and I can't wait for any other Canva'a surprises!!"
all editing options are excellent but can you add much more education related pics like elementary students that needs to make a cover for their essay that cannot find anything but highschool related.In overall it's excellent by the AI they use on one effect.I much recommend this app it's really helpful.
this aap is were well and good here we can easily make editing. And best graph are there and many more things you can get to see. This i will suggest every person those who are not knowing how to make editing it can be helpful for them also and and those who knows they can get bet and better experience of the aap .And it will be useful for every one best aap is this good 💯
"I legit come to canva for everything. #LIKEAPRO canva makes me feel professional. I love it I've been using it since 2016 and I don't think I need any other platform. Its structured so beautifully, tools are easy to use and find OH! And another thing B4 I go I have to say BIG BIG shout outs to yall for the Auto Save. 🙌🎯 Best designing/creating app in the game.💯❣🤟"
"I've been uisng canva almost 3 to 4 years now. Its really helpfull! Lots of designs and elements that we can use. Easy to use and very user friendly. I'm so excited know new features coming out soon. For the new features this year 2023, it was amazing!!"
"""In my opinion, the comprehensive range of features on the application was really supportive and this is highly recommendable. It increased the amount of views I had on my channel (@YourJapaneseTutor) and help made me popular. I love this application so much and is again highly recommendable I rate it a five stars. No lag, nothing. Just clear vision on what I'm going to make. Keep up the upcoming work Canvas!"""
"It has to be the number one design and graphics suit for all your needs, ever. Im even using it more than I use Photoshop now.Just a great bunch of people who look after everyone's needs, perfect"
"LOVE THIS! I just started streaming on Twitch, and I wanted to make my own overlays, ect. I definitely plan on paying for the membership if things keep going good with Twitch :) There are tons of free options for everything!"
"really amazing app. so many options and resources to really make your board unique. There's a premium version of the app, but it doesn't even feel necessary because the free options are just as gorgeous.No ads, and the app doesnt force you or make you feel obligated to purchase anything. Very user friendly and easy to figure out how to use the editing features. Lots of options for altering photos and images that come with the app. just an amazing app overall and I very much recommend it to all!!"
"I've loved using this app for the past 2-3 years. I do hair and it's been so helpful for all my appointment updates and such. minimal issues and typically even the pics with ""premium"" elements and be switched around to be free. HIGHLY recommend"
"👌really nice for editing ppt, resumes, stories, etc! It's just really sad that some are premium so sometimes you have to download it with a watermark."
I love this app. I used to always ask my elder daughter to make e -cards for me but I had to beg her to do it because she is a digital marketing manager and Never had time. Now I can do my own stuff especially because she is going to turn 40 in Jan 2023 and I am practicing to make her several cards.A big thank you to all at Canva. You guys rock !!!
This is a good app that makes my work easier when composing a presentation especially 16:9 presentation is excellent for me. The templates are unique and quality is what this app gives... Its a 5 star for me🥰
"I nowadays use Canva for everything, I always get compliments on my presentations. Using Canva is easy and fun, I don't have premium but it's great anyways. There aren't ads at all. Best app for projects, presentations or just designing!!"
"I use this app for very simple purposes to illustrate my poetry and songwriting. However, I've only been using it for a few months, because before February this year, I wasn't even aware of its existence. But regardless, it is a brilliant tool for giving a little flair to my creativity."
"I love the new features, although it is a little hard to design in the app on my phone. However, that is a phone issue and not an app issue as I have an older LG Stylo 6."
"A perfect app to create posters, price lists, flyers etc. I absolutely love the designs and ideas that pop up after each search. Multiple ideas to choose from."
"Easiest app for communicating with my online gaming friends. Connecting with people is always easy, with direct messaging and calling if I don't want to jump on a server. The only addition I want to see is a free option for an individual profile to have a personal emote. Regardless, unless they break it, this will always be a 5 star app for me."
"Great messaging app with a lot of thought put into ergonomics. It just does the right thing most of time. It is great for voice communication with groups it has, rich text and image messaging. It supports screen sharing and video. Other squashing the very rare bug I literally don't know how I would make it better."
"Discord is very useful for guilds/clans, etc. on games of any platform. The app is easy to learn, but when something isn't working, the help section may not be much help. The desktop version of Discord gives server owners more options for personalizing their server. I wish the mobile version were the same as the PC version. Otherwise, this app is a good app."
"Discord is such a wonderful place. I've made friends that I can no longer think of living without. There are only slight annoyances i have with the app. the friend requests popping up in notifs instead of friends, but that's alr. However calling people while listening to music is a nightmare, especially on mobile, you can't play Spotify over your mic (reasonable) but if you're on mobile, it's very hard to adjust the volume of music, and being in a vc warps the sound. But overall I love this app."
"Edit: The Discord team is extremely active in the community and the app is constantly evolving in response to feedback. This doesn't mean every response is always changed immediately, and it doesn't mean every change is good, but kudos to the team for trying their best and rectifying what goes wrong at a respectable pace. The app itself is not flawless by any means, but it's convenient and I like the fluidity of its state. If something sucks now, odds are it'll get patched eventually!"
"I like this app a lot, however there are some bugs. For example, the constant notification of ""Voice activity reduced"" at the bottom ofy screen, blocking out things. If the bugs get fixed, then 5 stars. I have a lot of good memories of this beautiful app. Edit: It was fixed a while ago, and while there are definitely some different bugs, this app is absolutely amazing. Been a Nitro subscriber for a few months now."
"The best messaging app for sure. Beats any other form of messaging. This app allows you to meet new people, join large and small communities of people who are into the same game/media as you. You could use it to just message friends too. Recently it even has its own built in games and soundboard. It's very very user-friendly friendly and extremely customizable with more customizable options for a cheap monthly payment."
"Awesome 😎 Everything I want as a social media app without being a built in texting app. I also really like that I can have it on multiple devices, PC, phones, etc. Super glad that there is only one way to become friended so that you are safe with wh ouou are friends with. I also like that there aren't intrusive ads or anything inappropriate. And it's free! 😁😁😁😁"
"Single best app ever. Literally the most versatile chatting app ever. Can also be used for streaming, server making, community making... And the interface gets constant upgrades. Literally the discord community has done no wrong for the past 2 and a half years. The only negative is that it takes time for them to finish their updates 😂. It's just simply the best."
"Bro it's discord idk why people meme on it so much it has way more features and way smoother looks than damn near anything. You can have multiple text channels which is amazing, and multiple designated voice channels, which is even better. You can set events, it's just all so GOOD. 11/10 would definitely recommend 👍. One thing, though, is that I wish AMOLED mode was available for PC. Still 11/10"
"Honestly, I don't really use the Discord app on my computer, but I gotta say, it's not bad on moblie. The only thing missing in the moblie version is that you can't join a group, you need a link. Also, when you press the compass icon (which is supposedly to find groups), it sends you to find your school edu. But, as of now, it's perfect for messaging my friends. (EDIT: After giving a revivew, I use a different browser, Opera GX, so it might send me back to the app.)"
"I use this app regularly on my computer to talk with friends. When I'm outside the game it's useful to message and contact people aswell. Overall I enjoy the app, I'm still trying to figure things out that you can do but all in all I'd say it has a good experience. User friendly for the most part but there is always information available be it in settings your changing or people who already use the app. The friend who had me download it showed me a lot of things you can do. Good app."
"A few years in and the app has yet to suffer any irreversible damage, the voice calling and ease of life updates are more often better for the user than a hindrance. Everything available to the basic user is well more than enough to satisfy their experience on the app. It can be used as a means of contact, discovery, and maintaining a relationship with your peers. A solid app with very little errors"
"How did Discord beat its competitors? Discord's combination of a user friendly interface, great flexibility throughout, a focus on gaming (or any other hobby), great community building tools and security, and excellent mobile support contributes to its success. Best part all for FREE! I've been using it 2016, and it is one of my primary software for communication with friends. I hope they don't do anything silly."
"I've been using this for years now and this is all I have to say. While it does have issues they're issues any social media app would have, and because the users can monitor each other to a level similar to the way moderators in other apps do everything is much more thorough, making it much harder to end up in toxic situations compared to apps like Twitter or TikTok. It's constant updates improve and build upon it's already beautiful interface and communication abilities, I heavily recommend it."
"Edit: this seemed to be an issue with my phone system, fixed via update. Discord reached out immediately to help resolve too. App won't refresh without force closing, I'm not sure honestly if this is a me issue or not, but the app refuses to refresh any channels without me closing it and reopening. If I change channels within a server, it shows me whatever was on the channel I was previously looking at. It's frustrating and I've missed out on pertinent information regarding competitive gaming."
"Discord is actually one of the only ways I talk to people.. Mainly because of how good looking the app is and how easy it is to use.. Daily conveniences such as sending important images to friends is quick and easy to do with just the tap of a button. (Unless you have to browse your images which include another app.) Discord is one of the apps I wish more were like/similar to.. I rarely experience bugs, but the ones that occur can always be fixed by refreshing the app (closing and re-opening it)"
"I rarely have time to sit at my computer, so majority of my time on discord is on mobile and it has served me very well, talking to all my friends while on the go. There's minimal difference between pc and mobile app features, which I find impressive. The only drop in quality is when watching shared screens or video in a group call on mobile, but that could also just be the phone unable to process it all."
"Enables free voice chats, video shares, chat rooms, servers, and a huge variety of methods for communication. It is very easy to organize conversations based on topic, and doesn't affect the performance of the computer much when playing games. Have used this app for school, work, personal projects, information sharing, and just for fun. Best way to communicate with others virtually in my opinion."
"Amazing app when communicating with others. I've had discord since January of 2020, and while I do miss the older Android version, I've grown use to it. I don't really like the newer font but I can grow use to it as well. Discord does update frequently with them adding unwanted/unasked for stuff, but at the end of the day, everyone's okay with it. I've made many good friends on here (planning to meet 2 in July) and use discord to talk to my old friends from my hometown after I moved. Great app!"
"Its been a really good way to talk to and make new friends but I've experienced a few bugs such as; sometimes the top and bottom of the screen will go very small and I cannot click them, and 2 it has turned my phone off and glitched my phone before. Otherwise it's an amazing app."
"Despite the Discord Moderator memes and all the other stuff, it's pretty good. Serves it's purpose well. I've met some great people through it, and I've had some of the best memories of my life from the friends I've met on there. Good for gaming or just hanging out. Can be a little confusing when they change the UI, but after a brief adjustment period, it's back to business as usual. Overall: 10/10. A must-have on every new phone of mine."
"love discord, been using it for years. though i've been having a mild issue as of late (since mid-may). the app doesn't let me send photos anymore. sending photos works fine on my desktop, but through my phone it just shows the uploading bar and it never fully loads. my phone can still send pics through every other app and i even tried downloading! lmk if this is fixable"
"It's great for just about everything when it comes to communication via text or voice. Largely customizable servers, profiles, and even profiles for different servers. The quality of everything has only gotten better, and I've been using discord since 2015; largely on the PC app as I don't use my phone as much."
It's very easy to get used to and everything works very smooth even with horrible wifi like mine it still manages to work. Another thing is that I can use it on any device making it accessible on every device. You can even cross platform call which is absolutely amazing. This app is top tier for me and many other people.
"Extremely customizable servers and channels to build and moderate or organize your communities. Whether channels just for friends to share stuff without all the annoyance of a group text while still having the option to talk or stream live, or running full tabletop sessions, or talking about your favorite podcasts, shows, etc., there's a lot you can do."
"I've never had any major issues with discord, it's a great way to connect with friends online. It is very easy to set up servers and customize with roles and channel permissions 10/10 would recommend this. There are a few features paywalled, but nothing that makes the app unusable, the main one is the max file size, unless you get nitro, their premium service. Nitro really does seem to just add to an already good app, with nothing necessary being paywalled."
"It doesn't really get any better than Discord. It's an extremely powerful service that can completely replace any other online messenger or VOIP, and with bots and server functions, the service completely transcends the programs it was built to replace. On top of that, it's cross-platform and very simple to use and understand wherever you're using it. At this point literally everyone should be using Discord whether they're using it to chat with others in online games or not."
"I can talk to my friends anytime, in groups or alone. I primarily use this instead of texting anymore. And the ability to game with friends on mobile while chatting through earbuds is pretty awesome too. A few bugs from occasional updates, but I usually see them fixed pretty quickly. Definitely my favorite social app ever created."
"The graphics of this world are simply amazing. From the subtleties of shadows crossing above to the attraction of two separate eggs finding and responding to each other, the parameters of this kingdom are absolutely spectacular. Once you have established your habitats, they are 100% self-contained and maintenance-free, except for what changes you decide to make. All in all, it's a soothing experience. The joys of virtual pets are highly under-rated."
"I enjoy this app but sometimes there are some glitches that need to be captured. There's one that is causing my images to not load or be posted even when I had stable internet. It's super irritating! But overall, this is a great app and perfect for hanging out with your close buds without the trouble of social media."
"Discord is easy to navigate, and has always worked quite well for me. Moderation and creation of servers is an easy and smooth experience, and I use it over my other social platforms. My only problem is call quality, as the other person and myself always sound underwater. It's barely noticeable, but it's there."
"Easy to set up, pretty easy to tailor to personal requirements. We chat whilst gaming online, the Voice is excellent. We use the messaging extensively and stay in contact with worldwide friends. We tabletop-RPG over webcam too, it's usually very stable and there are a lot of fun features in the whole app. I don't enjoy getting all the Nitro spam, but it's a very small price to pay."
"Discord is an exceptional app for communication and community building. The interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. Features include voice and video calls, screen sharing, and custom emojis. I love being able to join servers based on my interests and participate in discussions with people from all over the world. The app runs smoothly and is constantly updated with new features. Overall, I highly recommend Discord to anyone looking for a fun way to connect with others."
"Sorry for the very late reply. I think the notification is ok, but it doesn't show up sometimes. It happens with the DM notification. I do login simultaneously with PC sometimes, but I think that's not the case. I always use discord on the phone, so it only occurs by itself. I think you guys don't mind fixing this for easier communication. Overall, you guys are pretty good! Thanks for the response. Keep up the good work!"
"I have a small complaint with the most recent update about screen sharing on mobile (which I use every day to share & watch). There is a banner at the top of my screen (showing who is streaming and in what voice channel) that partially blocks the screen being shared. If that could be adjusted/adjustable would be great. Edit: for anyone with the same issue, there's a simple fix. Once in a voice call, toggle off the option of showing non-video participants."
"I've been using this service almost since it's release. Always the best quality audio from calls and fairly nice video considering the incredibly low latency steaming feature. I always find that in game VOIP are much lower quality. As a result I always try to convince players to get on discord where feasible. Now that you can use the app on your Xbox or Playstation, it's just the go to for all things VOIP and social communication."
"I love the discord app and have used it for a long time believe it or not but there's a bug that keeps happening, wether it be some channels in servers disappearing or it's just gone. It happened to me a few times and so far the only solution was to un and reinstall the app. Is it a problem with the app or is it just my device? Idk how to fix it if it's because of my phone."
"This is the best when texting your friends, sending funny images, and even can talk with your friends in a call. This is the best app for social media but it may be dangerous cuz there's some people who is crazy but be careful out there and be safe, have fun using this app and talk with your friends and others in the group good luck!"
"Discord is hands down one of the best messaging and voice chat apps I have ever used! The app is incredibly user-friendly and makes it easy to connect with friends and communities from around the world. The voice chat quality is crystal clear and the ability to create and customize servers is amazing. The constant updates and improvements to the app, Overall, I highly recommend Discord to anyone looking for a reliable, feature-rich messaging and voice chat app. 5/5 stars, no question!"
"This app has alot of memories on it for me. Some are good, some are bad. I get that Discord gets alot of hate because of the people on it, but it genuinely is a good platform and basically got me through quarantine without losing my mind. Discord has grown immensely since 2015 and it's honestly only gotten better. It's a great platform to get all your friends together on. It's a 5/5 for me."
"Very buggy, my first run of the app will welcome me with ""Connecting"" the app is acting like you're offline, in order to remove it, you need to restart the app once or more, it's annoying. (Seems to be fixed, thanks)"
"The app itself could use some work, but but much. From my experience, major Discord bugs are usually fixed within a week or two though. In terms of people, you can find anyone on here, for better or worse! I'm just lucky to have landed in an extremely supportive community, and they probably saved my mental state. So, thanks Discord!"
It's really good. But I have a issue that started two weeks ago. It keeps crashing while I'm on a call and it cuts all audio and it's getting a bit annoying. Please fix. Update still crashing and super annoying when talking with friends. Please fix
"Completely quitted all social media, were looking for an App that is only made for chatting (Nothing else) Discord made my wish come true. However, if the Discord app was like the browser one. I mean... Whenever I open the Discord app, it appears to me last person I chatted with (Or last person I opened my DM with, on the Discord app) so, if there is a way to make the option ""Friends"" (Like browser's one) instead of opening the last DM I chatted with. Thanks, anyway. The App is great!"
"Best Comms app. Best Devs, (even the patchnotes can be entertainment). jam packed with ""togetherness"" features: screen share, spotify sync, games, custom emojis. Does the basics brilliantly. (servers, text/voice channels) all super easy to understand set up and modify. don't like how the Discord devs have done it? well then why don't you do better, with their simple API and strong documentation if you're good enough you can spin up many features yourself by building a ""bot"" i <3 discord"
"Amazing app! I can talk to my fellow classmates and friends easily on this app. Plus, since I have talking issues, I can talk to them without stuttering. I also like how I can send my friends funny bitmojis and memes, and overall make them laugh easily. I recommend this app if you like texting or calling when you have a device that can't text or call by its self. And I recommend this because you can also make groupchats quickly. Also this app is EXTREMELY easy to use!"
"""GR8ST"" betting app I've experienced thus far. Personally, due to the fact that there's many ""if not all"" sports competition to choose from. Plus within those sports competition are highly unique specifics of the competition that prizepicks allows entries and because the specifics is so unique the WIN/LOSS ratio ""TO ME"" is in the account user's favour. Prizepicks is highly recommended from I. *****"
"Great app, but recently a personal server just deleted all but one channel. All on its own, no one but me has been online in a very long time and I'm still frequently interacting with the Taco shack bot. The data from the other channels is still there, but the channels themselves are gone. - Fixed itself, idk how. Great app"
"This is a very good way to connect with people, but sometimes people do too much connecting and don't know when to take s break and it becomes a way of life instead of a connection so I'm not really saying rhe app id bad but some people can't control themselves so you guys should help them by implementing time notifications or something like that."
"Great place to chat! Bigger upload limit is great. For me, the biggest plus for discord is that it is cross platform, the free type is good (nitro is advertised as bonus, not the status quo), and no issues with apple to Android occur. ★★★★★ - just as near perfect as a free app can be! I recommend this over phone supplied texting apps!"
"I love the app! But there's an issue, when I go and open it now discord seems to close the app. I'm uninstalling and reinstalling to hopefully fix this issue. Edit: It doesn't really happen anymore thankfully, so you've gotten 5 stars again from me."
"Incredible, just a masterpiece. Great to hang out with friends and stuff. A neat idea would be discord vr though. Some ideas for it would be a digital room where your server is and activities are like mini games you can play in the discord vr. Just a few ideas. Great either way!"
"Discord is an amazing app. While I dislike the nitro upgrade price and feel it isn't needed, it's exactly that. An amazing free app that does so much for you with a bonus option for neat little perks to help support this incredible platform."
"This is indeed a fascinating app! I've found so many online friends and also the amount of features that we can use in discord. But, in my opinion, this app is lacking app (activities) connection because I'm using mobile. I would like to see games like Mobile Legends being added (to Dc mobile) so that the people around can see what activity I'm doing, it would be fun if we could play together. Overall, everything works great while I'm using discord 😁"
"I love this app so much as an avid watcher and streamer on twitch among other reasons. As a gamer ofc but also a background in mental health treatment and pharmacology so watching this platform evolve so dramatically over just the last few years has been Incredible. I look forward to every new update and the majority of features are all but perfect for communities to thrive, much broader than just gaming. I also use Telegram which is equally great but Discord is just king atm. Keep rockin!"
"Starts off VERY slow. Picks up quickly based on skill. I feel as if I could help add some new ideas to the game, but great dev team. The game is updated often; with balance patches, new content, and all kinds of in-game items."
"Sometimes on mobile when you try and view or post a video embed with audio, the sound breaks and only loud static is played. This isn't a problem with files because it only occurs on discord. other than this bug the app is fine."
"If bigger then 8 inches then you use discord It's not super encrypted like MS teams and what not, but it's not supposed to be Constant feature drops, most of which are free, keep the app updated all the time. If some bugs arise, they are quickly fixed, and all in all the best and most fun communication App ever."
"Amazing app, but I do have one minor annoyance when using it. For some reason, for accounts without a profile picture, I will not be able to see people. They would just be invisible, and it's a little annoying because their messages would just blend with everyone else's. I tried clearing cache, force stopping the app, restarting my phone, but nothing is fixing the issue. Would appreciate it if this little issue was fixed."
"really good app. its been memed on a lot as ""only for nerds"" but its very customizable, convenient, and simple. you can make great communites, talk to your friends, and many other things. only thing they need to do to make it mostly perfect is to port over a couple features from pc to mobile, but other than that easy 5 stars."
"The app is absolutely improving. There are still some glitches like some menus being 5 pixels wide, but these are rare. There is still plenty of work to get it on par with the PC version. Can barely manage a server from mobile. But I finally believe in the dev team."
"This app is fun and easy to use! I started last year, and found out that this app is amazing. You can chat with friends, call with friends and even join groups! I joined BlackPink groups, Gaming groups, and there is just so much to explore! Buying Nitro just makes the experience much more fun. I recommend purchasing Nitro as well! Overall this app is amazing and really worth downloading! No ads at all! :) Hope to see more updates soon if possible :)"
"Overall really well put together chatting community, but every phone I've used it on, old or new, has one teensy occasional problem, I must stress that it is only occasional and not all that annoying, sometimes when I go to send a message it won't show in my end of the chat until I restart the application, still a very well put together app!! (I think this occasional freak out is due to me playing very large online games and fuzzing my phone out, so it may not even be the apps fault)"
"App is finely made. Perfect for community & server conversations, probably the best app I've tried overall the other communication apps I installed. Suitable for any kinds or predicated virtual activities, Including for businesses, studying, group chats, and e.g. so far no problems. Just hoping for a safer community & functionally well operated Application. Can't wait for furthur Surprises of the Teams future additional features. Loved it very much. met alot of friends across servers. 🐺"
"It's by far the best of the IM/chat apps. It's really well-designed, completely ad-free, and doesn't harvest data... all of their money comes from Nitro, basically a patreon for minor perks. Servers are completely customizable, and really easy to set up."
"Love this app, has always been wonderful. Unfortunately in the recent updates you can get stuck in the voice chat channels in servers. If you go into a voice chat channel, you can not get out of the channel and will just be stuck in that channel. Please fix. Update, they fixed it. Hallelujah"
"So far the most convenient voice server platform for gaming, education, work, just chilling and other activities. The video functionality is good but can be improved further. But overall is 👌🏽"
"Perfect for any group chat design for chatting, gaming and roleplay, I recommend it over apps like kik. Especially with the variety of groups you can join. It's basically usable anywhere but a toaster, though it can look intimidating and complicated with its many features and bots with time you will be able to manage it. Think of it like an iron man suit that you design for your own purposes"
"Great service, use it every day sending hundreds of messages and doing multiple calls and similar all while being completely free. Sure you can't upload the biggest files or images unless you pay for the Nitro and stuff but you really don't need that. Also the apps had a slight bit of ishues of mobile devices from a update a bit back but considering all the other factors it's still a 5/5."
"Discord is a fantastic application for communicating with multiple sectors of individuals/groups in your personal life. You can chat with your schoolmates, your family, your coworkers, etc, all in one place without the irritation of earlier comm channels such as Ventrillo with having to make alterations to your various server details to swap from group to group. Discord makes it easier than ever to have a user-friendly interface with zero problems on messing up the settings. 10/10!!! Use it!!!"
"I love the app simply put it works beautifully, especially when I had my Samsung s21 but I've since upgraded to the Samsung Z4 Fold and with the app, on a closed screen the parameters of discord cannot read the borders of the closed screen correctly. With a forced closing of the app only then it reading the parameters of the screen correctly"
"It's an amazing app! For some reason it doesn't let me use calls while my phone is locked, but that's the only issue I've EVER had with it and I've been using Discord for 6 years now."
"Best messaging app, I use it every day. Gets better with every update. On my phone if I click to reply a button or someone's profile it just gets really thin for some reason but I can fix it easily by turning it off and on."
"I rarely have issues with this app. The calls are solid, it has a slick interface, and they're adding new useful features fairly often. Premium isn't a bad option if you use the app frequently, however I only ever opt for Nitro classic at $5 because it suits my needs the best, for the price. I've been using discord for about 3 years or so now, and it's been a dream."
"It's a great app, simple to use. You can link it to your computer or smartphone. I use it only for video games and man it's been incredibly helpful when it comes to gaming and keeping up with events. The app is fine but sometimes you can't do much with the people"
"I was a wrong fr. 25mb update for free was really good, there's no ads, no popups asking to rate the app. It's always smooth and the UI is perfect. Really convenient for chatting with friends."
"I'm mainly on xbox, and the fact that I can use this to connect with my PC friends is awesome. I've been using Discord for years and have never had a problem with the app. Great for connecting with friends, and even finding new people who share the same interests as yourself."
"P much the only social media I actually use. Great for finding and befriending people who are fans of the same things as you, and also great for messing around and talking with already existing friends. There are a lot of fun bots you can also add to servers to play games with or have them preform utilities, such as play music or auto-moderate. There are paid features like file uploading, custom emoji use, and better streaming quality, but overall- you don't need it, and it's a pretty good app!"
"The app is working great! It's great for casual users who just want to chat, but not really that optimal for server admins who are going to change some server settings."
"Edit: The swipe to reply has been reverted. Thank you. Edited the rating. Original review: It was a good app implementation, but I hate the new changes to the UI, especially the swipe to reply. As an admin in a community, sometimes I need to swipe to see who is on, now it's a reply. Don't mess with muscle memory when making UI changes, at least give us an option to decide if we want those new changes."
"I have never encountered an issue. Quick messaging, high quality voice calls, decent video calls and screen sharing. The ability to create or add bots is great, the activities are fun and you can share relatively large files. It is the most ideal for most communities."
"5 stars. This really is the Holy Grail of Community apps and doubly so for gamers. It just does everything so perfect. From sharing pictures, to files in general, to voice, to organizing groups and threads and etc. IT. DOES. IT. ALL. Thank you Discord. And endless porn which helped me lose a 10 year relationship. I discovered I love porn more than anyone."
"Great app for communicating with friends and colleagues alike. Text channels can be added for different purposes, increasing efficiency and allowing you to sort your group chats. The voice chat function makes it very easy to communicate clearly in groups or one-on-one. Overall, Discord is my go-to app for communication."
"giving this app 5 starts becuase its really good been using it for along time now but the only problem I have right now is when in a call with someone sometimes it will disconnect one person for not talking to much and show up ""you have been alone in this call for 3 minutes"" and kick them out then eventually it happens to the other person to this is sad it happens often now becuaae the new update i hope it get fixed soon or atleast gets an option to turn it off and on"
"Best texting/calling app that has ever been made. Some people use it for bad things, but that does not make Discord bad it makes the people bad. I love that I can always rely on someone I just played video games with to have Discord. It's just really convenient."
"I am giving Discord 5 stars because it is a genuinely good app, and there is nothing else like it. It has brought me together with people I have never met before it has given me great memories, and it has made gaming with friends a much more fun experience. All for free!!! For these reasons, it is an app that is hard to rate lower than 5 stars. But with that being said; I accidentally spent $100 on Discord Nitro, and when I asked for a refund, they banned my discord account permanently."
"This is one of the best social media apps ever. Period. It is so easy to grasp, has a very likable system, and has various supports for different types of communication (texting, video call, and streaming). Overall, I would highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to chat with friends! 10/10"
"It's an amazing app. In my opinion it has one of the best ways to organize your conversations. You can do all kinds of customization, almost anything you could want. And it's a great way to chat with friends and hangout. 10/10 my favorite app."
"This latest update. My god it annoys me for no specific reason. My calls and everything run fine, that's all good and great. But the new way you do replies is Hella annoying as someone who liked to swipe left and look at the member list all the time, now having that disabled and replaced with replying is really annoying. Can we get some sort of option to revert this change? Thanks"
"I've been using discord for a few years now, originally to talk with real-life friends and play with bots and such. But then I started branching out into larger community based servers, and have met so many wonderful people!! I can't speak for more advanced features like streaming, but the messaging is near perfect. My only qualm is not getting notifications for regular messages in larger servers. I tend to miss out on covos bc of not getting notifications."
This is the single greatest social messaging app I could dream for. It is ergonomically and esthetically pleasing. It makes it easy to search for and share memes. It is easy to share code with the built-in text highlighting (that supports multiple programming languages). I would give it six stars if I could.
"Decent enough app, but recent update is terrible. Please fix. Now when I open the app, it takes forever to load things. There's a ""connecting..."" Message at the top of the screen with some loading bars and it takes several minutes to load even low quality images. I've also had similar connectivity issues sending text replies. Ik stability and cross-platform reliability have never been Discords forte, but this is the worst I've seen it. Desktop has always been better, but mobile is now broken."
"at the moment I'm having an issue where I can't hear anyone during VC and they can't hear me, I've messed with the VC settings tried many combinations. uninstalled and reinstalled the app. restarted my phone. I've accessed discord on the computer and it worked perfectly fine, settings weren't the issue. but the mobile app still isn't working, calling on other apps works fine, can someone help? UPDATE: it seems to be temporary fix, once i change it back to internet it goes back to previous issue"
"It's really fast, even though some features are limited by nitro, it's still a fair and stable/accessible app! Connections are nice, the bug issues stopped and every day the team works while communicating with us. I thank Discord for every experience."
"Discord is probably the single best app for someone who wants to meet new people to play games with or to just talk to. Although it can be difficult to find the right servers, (groups you can join to talk to people) when you do, you can end up meeting some amazing friends."
"The only place on the internet without freaking ads being shoved in your face. I've made some long lasting friendships through this app, and it's the go to place for me everyday. Literally a server for just about everyone and everything. Gaming, study, art, anime you name it. Just want a small space for you and just your friends? No problem. Make your own server. Truly the best social media platform to ever exist on the internet"
"Edit: I finally resolved my issue! Video call was turned off for some reason even though I dont recall turning it off, weird. Although I didnt get to check what the dev's suggested, I still appreciate their effort to try and help. C:"
"(Edit): I was able to gain my original account back, and I figured out it's easy to verify my email and what not, I just had to remove the phone number info, this is the best app for communication with friends and even finding new ones, if your looking for the best app to get involved in communities there's no better app!"
"Great way to connect with friends and new people. Easy to use interface and great communities all over the platform. Overall great app, would recommend."
"Love Fitbit, user of several years. I love absolutely all the features from calorie counting to exercise tracking to monitoring. I have one small issue I'd like to recommend. The recent foods is showing foods I haven't eaten in a while due to lifestyle change. I'd like to delete the items from my list or alphabetize them so I can find the food I do want to add, easier."
"New higher rating because app syncs better. I chose premium and like to follow my daily sleep habits as well as exercise. I ride a bike and the app gives me credit for steps(which I surely deserve!) Sometimes I use it to make sure I drink enough water. Used to use the food/calorie monitoring feature, it was good, but too much to keep track of, for my needs."
"I used to use Excel to track my daily calories and weigh ins, and I would run a linear regression, but this app makes it slightly more convineant to do the same. Also, as dumb as it might sound having little buzzes and beeps telling you to walk actually made me walk more often, and now I get a small sense of reward when I hit the 10,000 steps in a day goal."
"I really like the app. I like to challenge myself & check my steps, miles, floors climbed, etc., every day. I'm not very savvy on all the other stuff, but these little things satisfy me. I like to see how I slept & check my heart rate when I'm active. But unfortunately I'm gonna have to close the app, for it stopped recording the readings onto my phone & some on my watch. I've tried everything & found that I'm going to have to restart it all over in order for it to track & show my progress."
"This app is very user-friendly; it is great for tracking sleep, steps/activity, calorie-count/food intake, and bodyweight. I appreciate the nutritional information posts that show up on my screen to keep me mindful about my eating habits. At times , I don't drink enough water, and this app has me more focused on tracking my hydration levels for better health and body function. Also, I enjoy the articles on health, exercise, fitness, diet, and overall tips that are offered by the coaches."
"I love Luxe Fitbit. I love to track my sleep, exercise, and steps. I can also challenge friends and see what they are doing. Sometimes, I win the number of steps per week, and sometimes, I don't. It also syncs with my weight watchers app so that I don't have transfer data manually. I could track my meals but I do in the weight watchers app."
"I've been using this app on various Android phones for almost 2 years, and I am pretty happy with it! Obviously it's pretty much worthless without a Fitbit device, but as long as you have one, the app pairs pretty seamlessly, is fairly intuitive, and doesn't require a lot of maintenance. I wish I had more fine-grained control over what and how it displays, but no real complaints."
"Well, I have to have it, in order to correctly interface with my fitness tracker and to log my food! Accounts for my steps as captured by my Inspire 2, correctly interfaces my weight and other statistics from my third party Renpho scale, and lets me use other interesting features of my account. I wish that it would update my recently logged and most commonly logged foods correctly, though, and sort the former chronologically, like the iOS app did. Other than that, pretty good experience."
"I've had an Inspire 2 for over a year. I've banged it up (has some scratches, bumping it going around corner) and it still works. My only issue, which has happened only 3 times, is I wish there was a notification the server is down in the app. I'll go through the website rarely to just find out that information."
"I've enjoyed the app and being able to track my progress and compete with friends to stay active and engaged. Still learning all the functionality and enjoying it. 3/17/23 Well the Versa3 was short lived, will not sync any longer with the app. Tried everything to fix but no luck. Not impressed with durability of the Fitbit at all!!"
"It reminds me to walk and keep track of my water intake. Time change problem has been correcte, but all the ""updates"" ruined the app. It used to be easy to see the data you are interested in. Now they have a PERMANENT ad for Premium that takes up a third of the screen and cannot be removed. That pushes the info you DO want farther down the screen. Also, you no longer can rearrange the data you want to see to show first and either remove or move choices you don't want or use. Delete one star."
Update from my last review of one stars. I was getting frustrated my daughter's ace 3 wasn't connecting to the app. Through the app I was able to connect to support and I told them what was happening. They ended up replacing the device even though it was a present. The new device is actually working and my 7 year old is now happy to have her Christmas present working. The great thing was they fixed it very fast that I was shocked how quickly we got the replacement. Thankyou!
"I had a gastric sleeve procedure & this is super helpful in making my food choices every day. I love that it helps me keep a food diary. It was capable of scanning my food labels then I was able to set up what I ate to make sure I wasn't going over my calories, allowing me to manually enter the ones that were not in there database (it was rare that it wasn't listed.) I love having a timer & stopwatch features. The sleep stats are awesome. My weight loss journey is easier with fitbit. 🥰"
"Love the app. Been using it for several years with no issues. I've always had a Versa. Had the 1, 2 and now the 3. Love the device as well. The only thing I wish the app had was a Find My Watch option. We can use the Find My Phone option on the watch but there isn't the reverse option in the app. That would be super helpful."
"This app makes it so much easier to track everything I am doing with my Fitbit. I love the workouts, mindfullness activities, charts and metrics. There is so much useful and interesting information and data. Very easy to use and navigate! In fact it has totally changed my life and health in a positive way!!"
"I love my versa 2. Its still going strong after 3 years and that's saying something. If it can live up to my lifestyle. Which is saying something. I work a hot, dirty job(asphalt) and its withstood everything I've thrown at it. I am not easy on things plus I'm also pretty clumsy. But this review is about the app. Never had an issue. It keeps track of and displays everything your watch has going on from sleep to exercise. Enter what you are for caloric intake, how much water you drink, etc"
"I love my Fitbit. I've had some health issues and I can watch what my body is doing while figuring out what I can do. If something changes, I know it's time to head to the doctors. I like being able to see the average calories burned to calories eaten. I've maintained my weight better than ever. I wish they added a journal so I could log any abnormalities to the day. Sick, stressed, celebrating, drive all night... Knowing what happened might explain why some patterns might change that day."
"I haven't had any trouble with this app. I have a Versa and it tracks everything really well. I love it!❤ My old one worked better than this one!! I started using my NEW Versa 4 in November, and today I plugged it in to charge and it quit working. I can't sinc it, it is dead. It won't even charge. I am trying to contact support, got disconnected and never got a call back. Not very happy with this one at all!!!"
A fun easy to use way to track daily activities. Perfect for self motivated people of all ages. Many of the features are dictated by your choice of watches so really think that through. Pairing tracker to phone is quick. Lots of group challenges so you are never bored. Weekly reports keep you up to date on progress. A must have.
"More than a simply tracker. Love the data. This app is SO VALUABLE! It helps me stay on track and challenge myself. The Premium (more content) was free to try for 6 months. I am impressed. I have daily availability to quality meditations, which I very much enjoy. I also am able to push myself harder with focused exercises that range in time to fit my busy schedule. I am in the best shape I've been in years. This app along with Noom has changed my life. RECOMMEND!!"
I have had a Fitbit Charge for several years now. I started with the Charge 3 and last year got the Charge 5. I like the waterproof feature and the exercise features. The only thing that I wish they had was a walking exercise. I use the running function when I do my 2 mile walk 5 times a week. I like the swimming function when I swim laps in the summer. I have always been able to get any questions answered on the forum. I'm very happy with this device.
"Great for mid-level functions. I use this to track basic things: steps, heart rate, calorie burn, miles traveled in a day. The app can also track your entered calorie intake, sleep, etc. It keeps me honest if I'm good about entering my info, and I like that it shows how I compare to my friends (if you're competitive like me). Overall, a very good app for the cost of a fitbit."
"UPDATE: I called the help desk and with some setting changes we were able to fix the notification alerts! 😁 I've loved Fitbit for years. I really enjoy the challenges with my friends, it keeps me moving. But now that I've upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy 20, it is no longer is compatible. I receive no notifications to my Versa. I'm now thinking of switching to a Samsung watch. Even though I won't have my challenges with friends, l'll be able to use ALL the functions of my smart watch."
"It does a great job tracking so many things. I particularly like the sleep data as well as the blood pressure and pulse monitoring. The workout feature is also useful for tracking what zone one is in, such as cardio or fat-burn zone. It records all BP and pulse data for the workouts as well. This review only covers a few of the features because of my experience in those areas but there is much more I haven't explored yet such as being able to read emails on the wrist, a feature my wife likes."
"I have the Fitbit versa 2, and love everything about it, except after about 2 weeks of having it, the microphone stopped working for voice reply on text messaging. It was one of the reasons I bought it. I've tried everything from restarting, updating, and uninstalling the app and putting it back on my phone to fix the problem. Nothing seems to help. And so far customer service has not been able to help. Edit! Fitbit has completely replaced my watch and it works great, thanks fitbit!"
"Its great. I like the step tracker. Love the workout options. I mainly use it for running, and it tracks your heart rate the whole time, let you know how many minutes it takes you to go a mile, tracks your times per miles, and if you have Google Maps open, it'll also show your route on the Fitbit app. When you're all done, it saves all the information in a clear formats that's shareable via text, email, and to their social media type page. It's really awesome."
"If you need a little encouragement or a lot of competition to stay motivated, you will find it here. Connect with family, friends or coworkers to add additional support. Fun and fashionable bands make it easy to always have that reminder with you without being oblivious or tacky. Many helpful features wether you are trying to lose weight or just stay fit. Still a lot of problems syncing until I restart my phone."
"I really enjoy the app - especially the sleep score function. However, for the past several days this function hasn't been loading properly. It provides the daily/weekly scores, but it won't load historical weekly scores beyond a couple of months and sometimes just spins as if it's haven't trouble loading the data. I wonder if the recent upgrade on June 22nd has anything to do with it?"
"Issues with my phone and Versa connecting. I've had it for 8 months and just noticed the time was wrong, I looked and the Versa and my phone were not connecting at all. I've tried everything that made sense and it still isnt working. I need help! Updated: 10/2/2019. I called Fitbit support and they walked me through all the troubleshooting again and was able to figure out they thought it was the watch and is sending me a replacement.That has already shipped! Thank you Fitbit for being amazing."
"Had a tracker for a period of approx 1 month. App worked very well, no syncing issues, no tracking issues, worked great for tracking all the things I needed it to. When it came time for me to delete my account, Fitbit let me know that I had the option to download all my data and save my own copy before deleting everything. The process to save all my info and then remove my account was straightforward and clear."
"I love that I can track everything all in one place. The Fitbit app is compatible with my Bluetooth scale. It allows me to track food, snacks, and water by bar code, search options, and customizable entries. I can track my physical activity, though I wish there was an option for elliptical. Many other tracking options!"
"Great experience so far! Just about everything can be clicked on to get to a greater level of detail. As with most apps that track calories, I wish there was better control over the food database because there can be huge differences in what sound like the same item, and even items with nutrition info have errors."
The app is excellent and offers much added value to the fitbit products. My biggest complaint. Neither the graphs or lists include the year. Scrolling across the graph or down a list it is not easy to determine the year. The graph will display the year when choosing year or the complete history. Please add the year to the dates.
"Second time I'm using the app, with a few years difference. Keeping track of water goes without problems. Heartbeat is matured, I'm still learning the extra ways how to interpret data on my heart. I'm super happy with the sleep data and the detailed info available. It makes sense how I feel when I wake up VS how I slept that night. I'm a big fan! Using the Charge 4 with the app for about a month now."
"Love the app. I have a few issues with the watches due to durability but I really like how the app is built and the options. The only option I don't use is the food logging. As an American app it doesn't have a lot of Australian food and you need to manually log a lot of things. Like a lot of food logging apps too it doesn't really cater very well for when you make your own food from scratch. It would be amazing to have that built in, but I understand that's difficult."
"The app is great. I am an expert at setting up a new Fitbit, I'm on my 8th in less than two and a half years. The previous 7 I've had: two where the glass popped out, two stopped swiping left and right, one that stopped swiping up and down, one which wasn't calculating my calorie and step count correctly and the last one, the button on the left stopped working. I've kept with a Versa 2 for ease of future set up, plus, yes, I like the app 😁."
"I really like this app, although I don't use it to it's full capacity. The steps and floors seem accurate. I receive notification to move 10 minutes before the hour, if I haven't met the 250 step minimum. Activity goals and steps are acknowledged with vibration and a banner or fireworks display, very cute. Syncing is quick and easy. I love the sleep analysis, deep, rem, heart rate, awake time and check it daily. Logging weight is easy and the chart helps me monitor how I'm doing day over day."
From hardware to software even before it got bought off by goggle Fitbit was already making great products and still is. From their tracking devices to their smartwatches line up. Fitbit got a bit of everything for everyone. The app is easy to use even if you don't pay for the premium which is relatively cheap compare to other membership base products. 15/10
"I have been a fitbit owner for 11 years. Have owned 4. Have been so satisfied with the performance and easy use. I am a Golden Girl and electronics are not my best but have been very successful with all of My watches. And they never stop working. I've given away all of my old ones. Highly recommend. Cost is great, too."
"I find calorie budgeting, calories in and out SO helpful. Also, the 250 reminder in an hour is also helpful. Recommdations: Ability to have allowing optional exercises, i.e dancing. Program for Celcius (weather) & kilojoules option Have laptop option for calculating recipes. Allow for easier access 4 fresh fruit & veg instead of canned & processed food items. I don't look or listen to ads."
"Absolutely delighted I bought the fitbit sense, I've had it for 3 months now and I'm learning new things almost every day. I had a problem at the beginning when after only 3 weeks it had stopped syncing but perseverance with my phone app uninstalling then reinstalling, everything has been ok since. I bought it to track my atrial fibrillation and its certainly done that and I can show the cardiologist how often I have the attacks. Well done fitbit. I haven't used everything the sense does yet."
I haven't had ANY trouble with the fitbit app. it's user friendly and I like all the fitness data I receive. The caloric tracking is the best! I find everything I eat! it's a fitness tracker and not the same as a smart watch so there are less features but I like that. It's more accurate that my Samsung watch.
"My husband bought me a fitbit for Christmas and my mom bought the premium subscription for me. I cannot express how much I love it. I have trouble sleeping, and I was really struggling to lose weight. This app/ watch tells you so much, and helps you learn how to make better choices. When you activate the watch you get a free 6 month premium subscription. Plus, you get really cute little trophies- so far I've walked the London Underground, and across the Serengeti! Lol 😆 Just try it. Be well!"
I have had a fitbit for 10 years now and I love it! I have thought about switching to a different brand of smart watch but can't bring myself to do it! I will never make the switch. Fitbit is the best!
"I've had a fitbit for 7 years, no problems. Updated last summer with the charge 5. Worked great until some time in November. Thought I broke it, so I bought another. Neither will sinc with my Samsung Z fold. Will be switching to another brand, and canceling my premium service. Update 3/7/23: my fitbit is now functioning with my Z fold. Working perfectly."
Cool app!! Please update to run in the background so I can use the find my phone option all the time? Please also add a feature so I can specify that fitbit is worn on the inside of my wrist as opposed to the outside. I wear my watches backwards and I would appreciate being able to see the screen when I flip my wrist.
"I have had my fitbit for almost five years now and I love it. Using it gives me motivation to be healthier. I get my steps goals, water consumption, activities in. The app let's me log in my food and I can see at any time my food choices. I can track my sleep and I get reminders for getting ready for bed. If you subscribe for premium, you get all sorts of plans like diets and exercise tips."
Update April 2023 Excellent app pairing with my Versa 3. I marvel at all the functions of the watch available and how so useful they are. Original review from 2019 Excellent app accompanying my Fitbit watch. It's great to see family members' weekly steps score and to encourage them or taunt them. Many of the functions provided are invaluable.
"This app is easy to navigate. Love waking up in the morning to the ""silent"" alarm vibrating on my wrist instead of a sound or music. Great health monitoring with personal stats and reminders to move!"
"The app works well and consistently to link back to the device, and yield the data. I am data driven and there are some data comparisons that would be helpful in sleep management that could be added. Overall, a good, solid app."
"It is helping me stay on course in wanting to eat clean & be more hydrated. I like the water tracking & the scanning of food, but when eating clean I cook more & its hard to rate your home cooking to store bought. It is just a tool to use with my other tools I know. I need to see progress even if at s snail pace, so I like the weekly recaps."
"I love it. Fitbit and the app do for me what I had been using three other apps to do. One recommendation: Add a 12 oz quick add between the 8 and 16. Many products, from bottled water to soda to beer, come in 12 ounce sizes. So, now it's a matter of do I wait until I drink four more ounces and log the 16, or do I log 8, then once I've had another 4 ounce log another 8."
Drains to lot of phone battery. Fix it Update March : it seems the recent update has fixed the battery issue. All other features are working fine. One of the best fitness tracking apps out there. Informative and yet pleasing to the eye. Doesn't look complex.
"Superb app. Everything works as it should. Loads of features and access to wellbeing, fitness, nutrition and health sessions. I got a year of premium free with my fitbit but will definitely subscribe and pay. Worth every penny."
Overall I enjoy the app a lot. I've had it for 5 years now. My only complaint is that I wish the food logging section allowed you to search within your own foods that you've previously logged to find what you see look for versus having to scroll thru everything. The other features of the app seem to have all the kinks worked out.
"It is easy to use, and I don't really remember seeing ads, at least how I use it. The only ads are for enhancements that cost for the premium service, which I do not get. I have since gotten the premium service when I upgraded to a charge 5 device, which I like both the device and service which I daily use and recommend to others. I wear it in place of a watch."
"I love this app because it helps track most of the health stats i need to know about, as a bonus there are workouts, yoga, and meditation videos that are interactive as a workout or relax motivator and it tracks your bpm during the workout/relaxing session. the only issue i ran into is that i have a fitbit versa 3 and it can be inaccurate on readings, but i plan on upgrading to the pixel watch because i've been wanting to try out the whole pixel line of products for a while so here's hoping."
"It monitors exactly what I purchased it for. If you know what a fitness monitoring watch with the perks, txt, notifications etc. You can't go wrong unless you're trying to fit in with friends, get a fitbit. I get compliments & ask is it apple or Samsung smart watch. When I say fitbit & I've been using it for the last 5yrs. Yes, 5yrs same watch with no problem at all, 5⭐️'s & alot cheaper & as good quality! Budget Friendly! I can't afford a name brand for the same quality & results!"
At first I couldn't connect my fitbit to my phone but I read you can connect them to a computer running windows 10 so I tried that and had instant success. Then I reinstalled the app on my phone and I've had no trouble with my fitbit syncing at all now. I'm really happy with it and I'm so happy it's all working perfectly now. I've also found that I have more options to change features like stride length or sports on the online computer account then with the phone app.
"Excellent tracking device. I have been using my Fitbit for more than two years. It gets me going. I like that it tracks sleep and cardio rates. I don't feel like Premium is worth it, as I'm using another apps for mindfulness."
"Its easy for me to keep track of my water intake and heart rate while exercising. And I can see the face without my glasses, which is a big plus. Logging food is a pain. Fresh produce doesn't have anything to scan so everything has to be entered manually."
"Love this tool because it tells me when I am on target with my goals. Only thing I would like, is to be able to sort the ""recent"" foods alphabetically or last used date. Currently, when I search for what I ate yesterday for breakfast, the foods are not at the top of the list like I would think they would be displayed."
"I enjoy using my fitbit. I really got it to help track my sleeping and walking, I love the challenges I can do with my friends online. They also have great tips on keeping a healthy outlook on life. Sometimes, the app is a bit slow to sync. You always have to make sure you have the updated version."
"This has been an eye opener on many levels for me. ***This latest update, is causing The Health Matrices to not work and the app keeps crashing. 😭 March 16, 2023... My ECG quit working 2 days ago. So far, the things I've done to get it to work, hasn't worked. It keeps giving me the message: Error... Please reopen the application. So far, like I said, nothing has worked."
"Tracking heart rate assists in a good healthy exercise regimen. When I first started getting serious about exercising, I was over doing it, and not getting enough rest. For me this was indicated by an elevated resting heart rate at night. Once I realized this, and took it into account, I saw more steady fitness improvement while feeling more rested. Tracking sleep is also useful for this and general well being. I rely on this tool quite a bit to help me be fit. Ianamd your mileage may vary"
Only thing I wish is that my fitbit. Sends would actually stay connected to my phone once if not 3 times daily. I have to get and turn on my phone or or if I'm on. A video. Exercise when I'm on it. My phone and my watch do not stay connected and it says can't find phone when they're right close to each other. A little not since getting a fit bit. My wife and I have had friendly competitions she's kicking my butt but that's OK. We are really happy And We started getting our older Children Trying
"I really like the app, one con I come across is food logging. I wish there was a feature to input homemade recipes and the APP would figure out the calories and nutrition of the recipe. You can input your recipes but you have to figure out all the data to it."
"I've been using this app for years, it helps me track my workouts, and count my macros, this has changed my life and I've lost over 25 lbs with just being more structured tracking everything I do. I highly recommend this app for your weight loss goals."
"The app worked fine except sleep part didnt always log correctly. When the face of watch popped off after 11 months, they replaced it but old band did not fit new watch, and i had a terrible reaction to the new watch and had to quit using it. Versa 2."
The new update of 1/29/22 fixed it. My Fitbit Charge 4 won't sync with my phone as of this morning!! I've restarted Fitbit and phone twice. I turned off bluetooth and restarted it. HELP!!! 3/17/23 update: everything's been working fine! Love Fitbit Charge 4.
"Great for monitoring/tracking sleep, activities and weight loss. 3/21/23: I have to refresh the app everyday to sync with my fitbit, sometimes more than once. Very frustrating."
"It's great. My steps are counted. My calories are counted. My weight has gone down. I lost 40 lbs since last year this time. I kinda tapered off at Xmas. I keep my daily calories at 1,200 most days. It's soon the season for bikeriding. And fitbit can count that too! I expect to lose another 25 lbs in the next 4 1/2 - 5 mos. I haven't tried it swimming yet. But I'm sure it'll work great in water too. I chose this plain one cuz I want to focus on nutrition n exercise & not media."
"Fitbit Sense - just love it. Needed better monitoring of my pulse and step count and sleep (and more). You can see daily, weekly and monthly summaries. Very easy to set up and use."
Very informative app with loads of different options and tools to use. For some reason it won't link with strava. Great that there are different exercises you can do from the app.
"2023/03/05 foodlogging would be much easier if we could clone or copy and then paste a meal or a meal item from the previous day for things that are left overs. 2022/08/13 for some weeks the foodlog recent items doesn't function and new entries aren't added. Please fix soon! The one area I would like to see added would be of the ability to customize meal plans for say keto, paleo diet, or low carb diet."
"I enjoy my fitbit and wear it daily. It helps keep me motivated to exercise and meet my fitness goals. Great style. Easy to track. Only had difficulties twice; both times, customer service was excellent and helped me to resolve my issues."
"I had been using FITBIT for the last 4 years to monitor my overall health in my last lap to take corrective measures. In this, it has proved itself of great value. Thanks to the watch & APP combination that at 87 years old, I have kept reasonably fit to enjoy life!"
"Has everything you could want, it has a food log to help you loose weight and also a water tracker. And for females or also has a period tracker which is helpful. Most watch faces cost money though."
"Great and easy to use. I wish they wouldn't charge you for the premium features since they already charge you for the device. However, it's nice that they let you use the premium features for free for 1 year."
"Been using Fitbit for several years now. I think it is great! Could it be better? Sure. But, the app keeps improving so more people can use it. Keep working toward excellence."
Easy to use and more accurate than others I've tried. Edit Jan 2023. It is very frustrating that the app no longer auto syncs with my fitbit. I have to do a manual sync each day in order for the app to update to my other fitness app. I will definitely not purchase another fitbit when this one is done. Disappointing as I've had one since 2012.
"Literally the COOLEST, easiest to use app ever!! YOU CAN ACTUALLY SCAN THE BARCODE ON THE FOOD YOU'RE EATING AND IT WILL PULL UP ALL THE INFO!! How awesome is that!!? Or you can search the food item you're eating, and they'll have it! I felt like a kid on Christmas morning after I started discovering ALL this app can do! I got a Fitbit to track my steps, and had no clue I would be able to get this involved with EVERY aspect of my health because of this app! I'd give WAYY more stars if I could!!"
App is great. It would be nice to be able to see steps and heartbeat at same time on screen so as to watch real time... and not have to scroll back and forth. Thanks
"Love this app. I've been using it since 2016. First, it was just for keeping track of steps, but the app evolved and it does so much more: it records and rates sleep, exercise and calories. It has become an integral part of my daily routine."
"Fit bit has some great meditation videos under premium subscription. The app also gives you in-depth information about your fitness and bmi, among other things. The synch function to synchronize data from watch to app takes a couple of goes to work, so you have to drag down your screen a couple of times to make it synch."
"Love this app. Keeps all my data in one convenient dashboard. Now with Premium I have access to some great workouts, meditations, and a Readiness score which helps me set my exercise goals for the day."
"This app is the best, I track everything I eat and I'm 45 lbs down so it works. The awareness of what I'm putting in my mouth is so helpful, along with suggestions, recipes, etc. Two thumbs up!"
It is a wonderful app with more features than I could ever use. It really helped me when I was trying to manage my weight. It also helped me track my steps which is very important for me as well. I would recommend Fitbit to anybody looking for an app like this.
This is the first time I bought a FitBit watch n using the since January 28th 2023. The watch n app are both easy to use. The only problem I have is with the app is were you keep track of your water intake. I wish FitBit would also include coffee n tea intake cause there is no calories for them at all. It's just a suggestion n please think about it.
"Love the sleep and heart rate tracking, and steps have been truly motivational. Occasionally sleep doesn't register even after rebooting phone. Charger is aging too. Perhaps because I have a Charge 4. Looking forward to Charge 6 when available."
"Love this app for tracking my bike riding activity. Keeps track of HR, miles, and a map of my ride! I like seeing my sleep, resting heart rate, steps, and activity, which keeps me in touch with my overall well-being. I like the tips they give you each day. Now, if only the watches lasted longer."
"Really pleased with the fit bit app. Helps me keep informed about how many steps and other exercise I'm doing on a daily basis. I also use other parts of the app - sleep, weight, oxygen saturation rate, and calmness. Very easy and useful to use."
I'm very happy with the app except for the food part. I would like to be able to put in my own recipes. There is no easy way to do that. Also my recent foods are everything I've ate in the last year! Difficult to find things when you have so much in there.
Really love the features Fitbit provides. Syncing and transmission of data is quite consistent and smooth. Although I feel sad that Google is taking it over.
Easy to use. Wish they brought back the challenges. Gives insight to my physical activity and sleep patterns. Not sure app any good without a fitbit device.
"Its awesome! I'm actually very very upset that I'm not getting notifications right now. I am still upset and disappointed i can't get an email for resetting my password for Fitbit actually. Can you help me with this please? The Fitbit app is awesome and amazing but can u help me cause it says that Fitbit is unavailable right now, try again later its making me very upset that i can't use it right now to even check my steps either..😭🥺"
"I use the device without the subscription features. I use it as a watch and to keep an eye on my exercise minutes, steps, and sleep pattern. I find it works well."
Easy to use. I get regular updates on.my computer. Let's me know when the battery is low. I can connect with friends and join a group of exercisers and compete for steps taken each week.
"Being 80, I really love to see how well I sleep and how much exercise I get. I don't always do what I wish I would but I can't hide😏 Fitbit always reminds me to GET GOING! I never take it off except to charge it. Love Fitbit!!"
I enjoy my fitbit but I am definitely missing the games and challenges with my friends. That made all the difference in making it the best.
"I love WEBTOON. I have loved to read since I learned how to, but I was reluctant to install webtoon because they are graphic novels. I was used to reading novels with 350+ pages, thousands and thousands of words, so speech bubbles and photos were new for me. it was very easy to get used to though, and the stories on here are addicting! Very minimal ads and I love that there are comments from other readers. overall, a great app!"
I love using this app so many great reads and really does well with suggestions. Sometimes the translations may be a bit off but you can still understand the context. Only thing I wish there was is a way to see which comics your reading currently and have an episode or more to read at that time so you don't have to go through your entire subscribe list to see what you have for that day. I also wish there was a way to favorite specific comics so you can jump to your favorite ones immediately.
"I honestly don't really need to say anything about this. It's just awesome. It's like YouTube for comics but better. I'm not the biggest fan of daily passes, but it definitely stops me from binging (so I can barely complain). But you know what should exist??? AUTO-SCROLLING where you can adjust the speed. I think the lack of accounts is actually a good idea, though I think it would be cool to request Webtoons to friends through the app."
"The problem of comics crashing has become more than a minor inconvenience. The app is now overheating my phone drastically, something it had never done before, and comics crash too regularly. I have restarted my phone and even force-stopped the app to try to reboot it, but the problem persists. I'm getting a bit tired of submitting Feedback logs for the problem. I really love the Webtoons app. It has vastly improved the amount of reading I do, and it has introduced me to so many excellent creators. The Discover section allows so many people to try to tell their own story, which is so great (besides a bit of expected oversaturation of content, but everything is always unique in its own way)."
"I really love this app!! all the stories are great and are a great time killer. I just hope that webtoon will soon put the same features that are on the phone, onto the computer. for example, I really wanted to finish reading ""my daughter is a zombie"", but I don't have my phone at the moment, so I can't use the daily pass that I usually use on the phone. If you could PLEEASE put the daily pass option for completed series, the option to be able to participate in events, and the option to fast pass on PC, I believe this would really improve the app and make other users, including me, more grateful for it. :)"
"I've been using Webtoon for over a year now, and have minimal complaints. Its almost perfect, aside from little things. Once it uninstalled without my knowledge, but that was more than likely due to error elsewhere or just me being clumsy. I love the layout, the stories, everything! The app functions smoothly. I do wish it saved my reading progress in the cloud. I have to find my place every time I need to uninstall it for space or something. They treat their creators well. No better alternative"
"I really love this app a lot. People seem to be confused with the coin system. Its completely optional folks! You can still read for free just like before. If you do the coins you can just read a bit early if the author is a part of the new ""fast pass."" I've yet to have an author from one of my favorite webtoons participate in it. I am having the same issues with crashing as a lot of others. It seems to happen most often when the phone battery is low. Great app though! Definitely enjoy it!!"
"I love the content on this. The stories are gripping, binge worthy, and some of the most loveable characters. HOWEVER, I've run into a problem. This sucker crashes dang near every 15 mins. This didn't happen at all when I first started using the app but now it's a constant. Other than that one minor but SUPER annoying bug, the app is wonderful."
"So many stories to read, an easy format, and a great way for comic artists to get their stories out. There was only one bug. Sometimes, with seemingly no cause, the app will crash. Even when I have perfect internet, it just crashes. However, overall, a wonderful app that has given me ideas for my own stories and art. There's so much to love in this app that even with the bug, it is worth the five stars."
"Honestly, I LOVE this app so much. The stories are great, theres a lot of variety, and theres a coin system to purchase episodes when you just HAVE to read the next episode. The only thing that bothers me is that it does crash every now and then. I had a problem with it a while ago (crashed every 30 minutes or so) but recently its been fine.. Overall, it functions really well!!"
"I love this app, but there's a minor issue. Every time I'm in the middle of a long episode/chapter, it closes out and goes back to the menu of the webtoon that I'd been reading. It literally interrupts my reading halfway through, every time. Idk if it's a bug or what, but it's gotten bothersome. I wonder if the update will fix the issue... EDIT: That bug seems to be mostly gone. I haven't had this happen in months, so I'm putting the app up to 5 stars. Thanks!"
"Plethora of different amazing web comics, each with their own unique art styles and dialogues, to read from. Highly recommend. I think for these amazing author's/artist's sake. There should be an indicator if they are being sponsored (ect) or not. The app, in the future, could also use some optimization features. If you don't have a good internet connection, it has a hard time loading comics. And when it does load, it takes a toll on the phone. Though, it hasn't crashed on me in a while."
"Love it. Contains some of the greatest stories. Simple and extremely user friendly app. However I've been a little disappointed at the daily pass feature put on some of the completed comics, where you can only read 2 episodes a day. I sometimes want to go back and re-read a couple once and a while but I can't do that anymore bcs of the daily pass thing. I'm probably not the only one who is annoyed about this so pls webtoons do something about this."
"There's almost nothing wrong with this app! The only problem I have with it, is when there is a black background, and you scroll down, there is purple surrounding the outline of the picture (sorry if I didn't explain well) This app isn't what I expected it to be, I thought it was going to be your standard choose a choice game, but no! You get to read one of the many stories in this app, and you can watch movies/shorts! The detail to the pictures are amazing, and the story lines are amazing!!! 😃"
"This app is amazing and I honestly can't find a single flaw in it. That being said, I do have some suggestions that would make the it a little better like; having a read later list because sometimes you want to read a comic but you lose it with the ads and comic displays changing. And lastly a slightly better search mechanism, because sometimes you can't find certain comics without searching it a specific way. Would definitely pay for it if needed. ❤"
"This app is amazing! I love being able to read my favorite comics when they update. The app works really well, though there are some issues with the app crashing every now and then when reading. I'll be in the middle of an episode and the app would freeze and then close. I hope that it was a bug is fixed soon as it is abnoying. As a suggestion, I would love to see an option for a dark mode theme for the app."
"I love it. The art is awesome and you can really tell how much work went into making it. Also, I love that they have more than one style of art as well. The stories are great and I think that this could be the much needed impovement to reading regular books. Also I think that a good feature to add to make this even better is to have some music, maybe to set different moods or just some calm, chill music to listen to while reading your webtoons. Thank you for this wonderful app developers! ; )"
"Overall, just amazing! It's easy to get extrodinary, creative comics and create/publish some of your own! Let's not forget the great events and challenges that take place to inspire creativity and get you in-app currency, that allows readers further access to more great comics of their choice! On that note, it has an amazing variety of styles for per your interest! My sister and friends recommended this to me and I wasn't sure at first, but I took one look and now I can't stop! Hope you enjoy!"
"I have found this app extemely helpful in just kicking back and relaxing. Be warned though, you might want to set an alarm for a time limit.😅 You will get hooked. They are trying to upgrade the selection to not be romance only. Webtoon is doing a good job with the series, and fast pass is easily available. My only problem is I want there to be a way top comment wouldn't be so biased. Also, for whatever reason, I don't get notifications. God bless and have a good day!😃"
I love this app! I always make sure to be on here at 9:00pm sharp ever night before I go to bed and during the day when I have some free time during or after school. they provide several options for you to read and see what perks your interest and drawing you back for more but recently there has been a bad bug where webtoon won't open on my phone anymore and it continues to say webtoon not responding or webtoon keeps closing. I redownload the app on my phone and it fixed the problem temporarily
"I love this app, and have been using it since 2017. But recently, they added this 'daily pass' thing. It appears when you read a finished series, and it really gets in my way. You have to wait each day to read another episode, and its really annoying. Other than that new feature, everything else is very pleasing. From the layout, to the stories, and how literally ANYONE can make a comic for free, it's just a really great app. Recommend 10/10."
"I absolutely love Webtoons! I look forward to reading it all the time. But recently it's been freaking out on me. Notifications override notifications so I don't always see which ones have updated. And when there's more than one, I click on one and it sends me to the other, then if I try clicking on another one after that, it doesn't work at all. I've tried finding where I can report an issue, but to my knowledge there isn't one 😥"
"Best comic app I can read other critical reviews about crashing and glitching and yes, it does happen every now and then. It is not often and it will be back working fine super quick. I have downloaded other comic apps and this one you can read a ton of comics for free. I hate waiting a week to get to a new chapter, but you have a ton more to choose from in the meantime! You get to buy coins for a good price to have access to FastPasses. I don't like it because I get so hooked! Overall, is👌💟"
"Great app and almost no problems I've encountered with it. Well except for one, in dark mode when the pages are loading there's a bright white flash. Blinds me every time I go to the next page. It's a little annoying but can probably be fixed with changing the color to a black or dark grey. If that can be solved that'd be super and my eyes would thank you heavily!"
"the ads you see on youtube are insufferable, so it makes me a bit disgruntled to say that the app is actually pretty good. it's easy to use, and it provides a popular place for artists to share their work. i like a lot of the stuff in both the originals and canvas sections. the only real problem i'll mention is that it starts freezing up after a while when reading, forcing you to restart the app. that's how it is for a lot of apps though so it's hardly anything unexpected."
"One of my favorite go-to apps to pass the time. Love the webtoons; I'm always listening for the notification that a favorite updated. The only issue I have is that the app crashes kind of often, I might have to restart it as many as three times in one sitting if I'm reading for a while. This isn't that bad though, and the value of these stories easy outweigh the inconvenience. As for a couple of webtoons worth reading, I recommend Lore Olympus and UndeadEd. But not to worry if you find you don't like either of those, the styles are varied such that there's something for everyone."
"The stories are all interesting and make you want to read more and the system of waiting a week or two for new chapters seemingly helps with organization of the app. In other reviews, people are complaining about the coin system, but in all reality, that is an optional thing, you dont have to buy them. If a comic your reading isn't updated yet, there are hundreds of other comics for you to read. Overall, its an interesting and great app. Me and all of my friends in my school use (and love) this."
"Almost endless content across a huge range of art styles and genres. You can absolutely enjoy the experience without ever paying for fast-pass coins, and if you decide you just can't wait to read that new update, the pricing model is very reasonable compared to similar apps. No ads, and you can access the full contents of the app for free if you're just patient. The original series are excellent, and there are some hidden gems from independent artists too."
"I have yet to find a bad thing about this app; it has variety, dedicated and amazingly talented authors, and it's all free. The only thing I could ask for is syncing your reading progress across multiple devices. For example, I have 2 devices with the same account logged in on both but different progress amounts for each comic depending on which device I read it on. Not a necessary thing but it's a little annoying."
"I love the stories the authors produce and that people can make a living off this app. There are distinct types of books such as fantasy comedic, horror, realistic, etc. The only problem I've ever experienced is because of my own wifi. It is smooth and easy to use, sometimes authors include music, I can't remember ever experiencing ads, and there are many different genres! It's PERFECT!"
"Hello!!! For the people that are having problems with the app suddenly crashing. It's been happening to me but it is 100%the actual phone itself. I know that both Samsung and Apple are having issues in where their phones suddenly crash apps and are even considered un-openable. I had to reset my phone before I found out that the issue, on Samsung, is Webview giving people issues with the new update. I really hope that people understand 🙏"
"I have had this app for years now and there are still more being added! It's got all kinds of different catagories like zombie apocalypse and romance (several different kinds). I think the action/ mystery ones are really good as well! 5 stars from me all the way! Tho if i'm being honest, five coins for the next chapter is a little annoying. Rather have the adds to read the next chapter for all the comics i like so that it's helping the authors more and people who are dirt poor can read the part."
"Absolutely happy with this app. The first story I read was True Beauty and I loved it! After the last chapter I was disappointed that I would have to pay for the rest but then I realized new and free chapters come out every week! Stories are fun and intriguing (and a great time killer), I recommend this app to anyone who has some time on their hands and loves animated stories."
"This app is perfect in every single way with how user friendly the interface is, you can find exactly what you're looking for with little to no hassle at all. There is one small drawback though and it isn't enough to make me change my rating from 5 stars. The only notable missing feature is that there is no way to discuss a series outside of the comments per Episode, something like a forum or a messageboard on the main page of each series. Other than that this app is 100% amazing!"
"This is an amazing app. Allot of amazing stories. A great way to lose yourself in an amazing story. I have had a couple of issues with the app the past couple of days tho. I open the app, but whenever i click on one of the webtoons I'm subscribed to it won't load. I tried uninstalling and re- installing the app, but now nothing will load. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. I miss my stories."
"I absolutely LOVE webtoons and I would give them 5 stars however, I'm currently getting kicked out of the app now just by opening it. I've tried restarting my phone, turning it off for a minute and back on and turning on and off airplane mode. It's still kicking me out and it makes me so sad cause I just started reading a really great story! Edit: I just uninstalled and reinstalled it and it's good as gold again!"
"I absolutely love this app! The art, the story's, the creators, everything is amazing. I just have one suggestion, I think it would be nice to be able to make ""playlists"" for webtoons. Because organization sucks, I'll have like 20 things to figure out when to read. If we were able to organize certain webtoons in to certain groups, for example I'd have, ""Need to catch up,"" ""All caught up,"" ""Daily pass,"" and, ""Finished, but want to remember,"" I think it would be a really nice update to have!"
"I love the stories and that you can get everything for free, you just have to wait. The quality of the content is amazing! The only suggestions I have are adding a button to tap to scroll to the next portion to read and connecting the chapters so you don't have to click the arrow for next chapter. Also maybe have a series fast pass for 10 coins or something and that would allow you to fastpass for all future chapters of a series."
"Great app! Only thing that bothers me is that after extended use, it'll slow down drastically and crash. I have to close it and reopen it regularly to avoid this/reset the speed. Dunno if it's my phone model, but none of my other apps do this, and it happened on my old phone, too. EDIT: Issue has been fixed and no longer occurs."
"Its quite good really, but I sometimes get a panel from another comic or previous episode covering a panel of an episode i am reading later on, I am not sure if it is because of poor connection or just some minor bug, but whenever it happens I just back out of the app, wait a couple of seconds, then get back into the app and it sometimes works. Other than that, I get to read whatever I like, whenever I want!"
"They have a lot of different options to pick from and different genres. Even without the app I was able to keep up with my readings via email everytime an episode updated! Downloading series or episodes is easy and quick so long as your connection is good. Last year, it was a hit or a miss exiting the app expecting it to bookmark exactly where I left, but that's fixed now I guess. Either, I'd recommend! A lot of nice stuff for everyone w/ plenty of episodes as well."
"tbh this is the only app I have never regretted downloading, EVER. The layout is so easy to use and it gives me no trouble when modifying the settings or changing preferences at all. The fact that I have over 50+ items to read is what makes it so enjoyable because I never get tired of my reads like I used to when I would have to hunt down comics from individual sources. Definitely one of my best finds on the web of all time.😊😊🖤🤘"
"I looooooooove this app. It doesn't inundate you with ads, it's pretty good with recomendations, & it's a really cool platform to encounter new stories. The only suggestion I have is for the addition of a schedule that only shows what you're following. Either have it be an option in the drop-down box in the ""daily"" section or added as a part of the ""my"" section. It would help you keep up with schedule for the comics you follow, especially if you are subscribed to several, which I would love."
"Literally AMAZING (⊙＿⊙)! It has a whole bunch of webcomics and so many genres! I don't get the concept of daily pass, but I just don't pay attention to that cuz its confusing. It doesn't have ads that pop up in your face every two seconds, which is nice. It's a really good app and I'm obsessed with it."
I love this app and the stories are great. i buy coins for fastpasses for all of my favorite series. I have just a few suggestions though. 1. Have a parental control option where you can filter out explict content from showing. Or at the very least a rating system that tells us how mature the content is before reading. 2. A subscription based service option where you upgrade to premium for a small fee every month but then you never have to buy coins to fastpass. Great app!
"Love it. Really easy to use. Though the only thing that kind of bothered me at first is that when I got a new phone, and logged into the webtoon app, my reading list was empty. So it seems that whatever I read stays on that device even though it was from the same brand. The same with my tablet. THAT was the only thing that bothered me a bit. But no problems. But the amazing content and easy to use definitely great."
"This app has always been one of my favorite. Easy access to amazing comics, entirely FOR FREE if you wait a week or so. It can also be a great way to develop and post your own art to improve. Many people complain over the ""week waiting"" and ""you need coins to fast pass"" but I honestly think it's worth waiting. Artists also need time for themselves and also money to support their lives. Not only is it a great comic reading app, but it can also be a side career for extra money. Great app."
"It's a fantastic app, and has basically taken over my life. This is now the only form of entertainment I really need. I have practically forced all my friends to try it and they have become addicted too. I would totally recommend. Oh one improvement that affects webtoons a lot: Add a way to like an episode that has been downloaded. Maybe when a connection becomes available update the like button or something, but not being able to like downloaded episodes gives a skewed view of a series' likes"
"The comics are great, I won't recommend any in particular because it really depends on your preference for which ones you'd enjoy the most but webtoon has all kinds. The app itself can be a little frustrating at times, especially when trying to look up authors or titles because it seems like sometimes they just don't show up and random things pop up. One thing I really wish the app had was a separate section under ""my series"" specifically for the daily pass comics so they're easier to find."
"There are a variety of comics that you will love. It gets hard to put down your phone whenever you start one and then the suspense can be immensely big (it's definitely worth the wait!). The only thing that I wish I could do would be able to get fast passes. Maybe these can be obtained by doing certain things on the app? It's a helpful thing for artists for sure though, so I understand the use of fast passes."
Absolutely love webtoon!!! I saw this on an instagram ad and I'm ecstatic I downloaded it. The entire app is very organized and easy to read. Each story you read saves your spot with ease of returning to the page. The authors have wonderful stories and artwork and theirs plenty of options to read for free. But if you want to skip a head the price is just right for that as well!! Favorite app on my phone.
"Amazing access to enough content to keep you reading for years. Not everything is for everyone but there's so much variety, I feel like you would have to work hard NOT to find something you like. Worth the money to pay original content creators. I downloaded this because of Sweet Home on Netflix and was happy to find the entire comic in one place for a reasonable price and an app that works intuitively."
"Absolutely love it! I've had it for years and not a single problem. Other comic apps make you watch all these ads or pay coins to read the actual story, but with webtoon, although you do have the option to pay coins to get the next episode before it's released, but you'll still get to read it either way if you just wait till it updates! Best webcomic app out there!"
":) happy. I've been reading Down To Earth, and it's great. It's all I've really been reading but maybe I'll get into something else. Guess I should join some webtoon groups online and find some recommendations. The slower, non-daily output of episodes makes it more interesting and exciting! I recommend getting it. Literally no ads, other than the HIGHLY occasional ads for another comics and the other third party ones, both of which never interrupt content nor app usage."
Ok so I love the app and I've had it downloaded for like a year or so.. I have no complaints. Just a suggestion. When you're reading an episode and there's the forward and backward arrows in the bottom right corner. If the next episode needs a fast pass I think it'd be cool if the arrow was like green or something to show you it needed a fast pass.
"Perfect place to read stories, if you finish one or get bored, there are literally hundreds to choose from. It's addicting really, having basically an infinite amount of short, fast stories at your finger tips like your own personal library, so be careful about that."
"Webtoon is an amazing app to get if you love to read and spasificaly comics. It has all the types of comics you might like, and if it doesn't, you could maybe even make your own! Also, most of them are updated once a week, so it wont hold the suspense too long. and most importantly... Its all free! you dont have to pay anything to read any comic! all you have to do is explore the comics, and enjoy yourself. I really like webtoon, and I hope you make the choice to download it."
Super fun and well done comics. Easy to use the app. The ads are not excessive or obtrusive. It very quickly figures out what comics you will enjoy. Every comic I've found has had a unique and interesting art style. Sometimes takes a bit to load if not using very fast internet but you can temporarily download chapers of a comic to your phone/tablet so you don't have to wait on loading times and can read them without wifi. the cost to read chapters early isn't much either.
"IT WAS AMAZING!!!! I don't have to watch an ad every episode. I don't have to pay. There are so many cool events that give me free coins, so you can read an exclusive future episodes. I reccomend downloading Webtoons! The quality is always up to par for the Originals along with the app itself. I don't have good wifi, but it works even with my bad wifi!!!!!!"
"I can't recommend this app enough. The stories, dialogue between characters, and art are phenomenal. Also, you only have to pay if you want to read a few of the newest episodes ahead of the normal, free posting time frame. So totally optional, but still reasonable pricing in my opinion. I'm a fast pass reader for all my subscriptions because 1) I can't get enough and 2) I really want to support their authors. Wish there were other apps that could live up to Webtoon :("
"I love webtoon!!! I enjoy all of the stories I have read and it's very easy to manage, the only thing that I am struggling with is that when I open the app it will only work properly for about 5min and mid-story it crashes and starts acting funny and then I have to restart it. But if that bug is fixed, I will totally recommend it to anyone!!"
Ok at first this app was really great i liked the layout of the reading and searching for new content was so easy.... BUT just today I've started having a problem I can't barely read for 20 seconds without it crashing And it won't load any new things. It just crashes. But if you've read it before then it doesn't crash. But in this current state I can't use the app. Edit: it is soooo much better now and it has so much content i can't even begin i love it so much ❤
"I absolutely love this app!!! I love reading the comics!! But there's 1 thing that bothers me. Let's say for example that there are multiple comics with the same name. If I wanted to show my friends one, I can't screenshot to show them exactly which one. I understand why this rule or setting would be in place, because some people steal others rightful art work. I just get a bit annoyed by this."
"It's great ,but there's one really annoying problem. For example let's say I was reading a story then I go to read another story sometimes pictures from the other story will be shown on the other one and sometimes it doesn't load in the pictures at all. But it's still a really great and fun app and amazing for trying to pass time"
I absolutely love all th comics on here and it's a great place for people to share them. Its also cool that you can add comments on each comic and your able to sigh back into the app if you delete it. The only complaint I have is that it freezes and crashes after a while of using it but it's ok if I close and re open the app so I guess its fine. But in the end this is a great app I would recommend to everyone because there are so many genres and art styles. Also CANVVS comics need more attention
"I love Webtoon! So many talented artists and story tellers all in one easy to access space. I have one ask of the developers: I would appreciate it if each comic had a episode out of x amount feature. For example, I am on episode #3 of a new webtoon (and yes that does show in recents) but I wish it said episode #3/50. I checked settings and this does not appear to be an option yet. Thank you for the lovely app!"
"I absolutely love this app. The stories on it are amazing, the controls are pretty simple, and if you want to go back and reread other past episodes, you can. Although i did find something that doesn't make much sense and that is disagreeing with a comment. If you accidentally hit the disagree button, you can't change it. That does bother me a little bit but it doesn't take away anything from the app."
"I love webtoon. It's convenient and fun, and isn't one of those apps that basically gives you no opportunities if you don't spend money. The comics are good and engaging, and there's lots of opportunities for free coins and such. The ads don't just pop up randomly, they're placed at the bottom where you'll barely notice them, and don't obstruct your reading at all. It's a nice way to spend time, and thoroughly enjoyable"
"I absolutely love this app. I discovered it a few months ago and fell in love with Webtoon immediately! Though I do have just two complaints, there are barely any opportunities to earn free coins to use to fastpass, and I don't like the fact that some completed comics become daily passes and you can only read 1 or 2 episodes a day for free."
it's amazing. it rly is. I love this app. I've never had any problems. just be aware if u pay the coins to skip forward u either gotta keep paying or wait twice as long for the next one. but it makes that clear. amazing app. love it. I use coins of season finales because I'll have to wait anyways for the next season to come out. 10/5 stars easy.
"I've had this app for over 3 years now, I think, it's been an amazing experience, I love this app, I've always keept it, even if I need space, it's never an app I would have in my mind to delete, I've never had bugs, never had any bad translations, viewing experience is fantastic, overall, a great place to read for younger viewers, and older viewers"
"I've been using this app for ages. I love the stories. It's a bummer when I find out some comic is unfinished (the creator just quit for some reason). But I've got i think like 6 or so comics i regularly read, and some others on a back burner for ""just in case i feel like it"". I love that I dont have to pay for any of it. There is a fast pass but that's only if you're really impatient, I just wait for them to come out. (Not that it's not tempting sometimes)"
"Love this app and have been using it for a while now. It's one if the best comic apps I have used. I personally don't mind the new coin system as I pay on other apps to read comics. My only request is that more payment options are added sometime in the future for those who want to read ahead. Paying 99 cents every other chapter is a little tedious. Edit: With the increased payment options, my reading experience is even better. This is one of my favorite webcomic apps."
"I couldn't give anything less than 5* to the app that introduced me to Cursed Princess Club! Honestly though, this is a great app with many incredible artists and authors involved. Fast pass for more episodes isn't necessary but is a sweet way to support them. Otherwise, all of these stories for free? I can't fault it. There are also occasional reading events for anyone interested in that kind of thing. Overall, I've never had any issues when using this app and only ever positive experiences."
"Ive been wanting this for a while and im not really disappointed to be honest. I love the stories everyone makes and everything its a great app! there are basically no ads, they are barely noticable at least. Sometimes if ive been reading for a while the app freezes and if i turn my phone off then i cant get back in for about 10 minutes (but its not COMPLETELY frozen) I have an android samsung s4 if that makes a difference! T^T"
"This is an utterly amazing app to read web comics, but lately things have been buffering more than they usually do and I have to close the entire app and re-open it to get to read and then it starts buffering again! It's frustrating because my signal is the same as it used to be, yet it buffers so much now it's like I have zero signal whatsoever. It probably isn't something the creator can fix, but I still think that it is truly an amazing app!"
"Webtoon us a wonderful app and I've had it for years, but my only complaint is that recently it has been crashing and I've been unable to read webtoons, I've noticed other people have had this issue, and that someone came up with the idea of deleting and re-installing, this works but is only a temporary fix, because after a small while it crashes and then keeps crashing"
"I loved it. Had it for awhile, but had to uninstall it. I love that I can install it again. This app is great, it has custom story's for you, saves ones you read, and much more. It has alot of different styles of comics, reading points, drawing styles, genres. You can find romance, historical, fiction, animal, science. I loved it, and I will give this app a five star every time."
"I love this app, and it's the one I spend most of my time on! Most apps have ads every five seconds, but here, there's a small one at the end of the comics that you can easily look pass and move on. Yes it crashes once and awhile but, reload and enjoy. It's so nice to support artist who probably wouldn't have the chance to get where they are today! 10/10 REALLY recommend."
"Best comic graphic novel app I've used. Not only has it reached places like Netflix to support its creators but it has gained quite a reputation for the writers within all over the world. The app is a great FREE way to enjoy all sorts of stories with great visual images. You can even pay a VERY CHEAP price for a handful of ""coins"" that can purchase ""fast passes"". Allowing you to purchase episodes that aren't intended to come out for days, weeks and even over a month."
"This is the best app I have used for reading online out of all of the ones I have tried. I thought it would be a couple fun comics, but my experience over the past 2 or so years has proved this wrong. The only problem I have is the daily pass. You only get to read one episode per day, so it has taken me about 6 months just to finish one story. Overall, a good app with wonderful creators."
"The stories are incredible, the art, the dialogue, the characters, everything is amazing. As far as the app itself it is pretty great as well although there are some things that need work. Servers will time out every now and again but that is to be expected due to maintenance which is understandable. Very well organized and easy to navigate, the prices for coins are also very reasonable. Honestly there isnt a whole lot wrong with anything, it isnt perfect but it might as well be pretty close."
"Great place to find fictional stories and admire different art styles. a great way to past time, imo. I cant count the times that I thought ""I'd just read a page..."" then eventually would read over 20 panels sometimes lol its really fun and the best part is; it's free! for the most part, unless you want to support the artists, which is nice too ❤👌"
"I have been using this app for years now and it is absolutely amazing! There are some downsides when it comes to more mature comics but it makes sense because there is younger viewers as well. Also I don't favor the daily unlock on already finished comics, it would be better to just have them unlock weekly again because then they wont be available if you want to reread a part multiple times. Other than those things its overall a great app!"
"This is one of the best apps for comics. There is a wide variety of options to choose from and it's a great way to support the actual artists/authors. Yes, you have to wait for new updates on many comics but that's because they are making them! And everything is absolutely free! (Unless you're wanting to read ahead un select webtoons)."
"There is SO MUCH available to read. The fast pass coins are fairly priced if you want to read ahead in the more popular comics, but there are dozens of stories that have 100+ chapters that you dont need to pay for and have plenty of read time. I have seen other apps reviews that make it seem like you have to pay for everything or jump through a lot of hoops to read. This isnt like that. I love this app and the comics on it that I read."
"ive used this app for a very long time now, and id say its very nice. most of the comics are fun and interesting and there's so many choices of genres. I love the amount of individually in the stories too, most are never the same storyline you're reading in a different one. I'd definately reccomend this app to other visual novel readers as well. everything is free of charge unless you want a fast pass to read ahead of everyone~ that's completely optional too. the ads are never an eyesore either"
I have an idea! But you dont have to do it just a suggestion. So what if you had an automatic scrolling thing. The webtoon panels will move on it's own and you would choose the speed of how fast or slow you would want it to go. It can be one of the options before you pick where you left off or the story chapter you would want to read. It can be located in setting.
"I love this app. It has so many different types of comics and the quality is good as well. They do easy challenges so you can get free coins, even tho I dont get my coins when I complete a challenge I still love Webtoons. But one thing is that some completed comics are not fully available anymore, you have to buy them and I dont want to pay for something Ive already read before I just want to enjoy it."
"Amazing content with no need to spend real money unless you really want to support the artist. New content all the time. I've started a series from day one all the way through to the finale and found already completed ones and binged them all the way through. Download this app, you'll only regret how addicted you get to the incredible stories and art styles."
"I downloaded Webtoons, thinking it would be a gimmick I'd just end up deleting off my phone. I was pleasantly surprised by an easy to navigate application with unique story lines and incredibly talented artists. There is a wealth of different genres and art styles, and you can pay for episodes that haven't come out yet, but you don't have to and coins are affordable. Some of my favorite series are Webtoons. 10/10 highly recommend."
"Really really great stories!! they are usually very appropriate, and if not, they have warnings. comment system is organized very well, easy to go back to comments you've left, or find what other people think. Also very easy to find your way around the app, even after coming back to it after a few years. Lastly, the communities that creators on webtoon draw in (no pun intended) are some of the coolest out there."
"It works great but it would be awesome if there was an auto scroll thing. Like, it could scroll for you and you can set the speed, and once it gets to the end or something that's not loaded it stops. Then I can read it without having to sit there an hold it. So I could eat and stuff. (If you have webtoon I reccomend reading Lumine)"
"The app is great, i have weekly comics that are full length and are great time passers, the app allows for ar and music to play over the comics at the designers choice. I do have one gripe, albeit it wont get in the way of me rating it 5 stars. I have a Galaxy S9 which is really powerful, even 3d apps that have tons of mechanics wont overheat my phone, but it seems that Webtoon does overheat my phone if i binge more than 6 full length webtoons, most likely performance issues but nobody has gotten to them, at points after my 4th webtoon it would also ""crash"" or leave saying the app isnt responding most likely due to overheating."
"I love the stories in this app so much it's been my all time favorite and my pass times. Hopefully they turn some of this into animations I would want to see it as an animation series hat would be so great 👍 what I want for animation would be the rebirth, housekeeper, lumine, unholy blood, and true beauty. Etc. Equus siderae."
"Weebtoon has been the best manga reading app that I have ever discover it's full of different kind of stories,tales, comics and more.It's full of 28-30 different genres of stories, the app keep you updated when one of your Comics your reading is updated. This app allows you too free pass comics meaning that you can read chapters ahead of time. All in general every comic is free. You can buy coins to free pass any comic that you would like! Enclosing this app is very entertaining/enjoyable."
"it's a great app but out of 10 I'd give it a solid 8 out of 10, Firstly because the available web toons you can read is amazingly abundant I can't find some of the web toons I've wanted to read, Lastly I find a hard time to read it because I'd have to scroll but it's just me. Over all it's a great app and everyone should use it (Hoping for manga to be added)"
"There's plenty Webtoons to read, each categorized with certain genres! If you like reading comic-like stuff with various options, then I definitely recommend it. There's different art styles, story types, and it's just overall fun to binge read from on Webtoon to another. Not only that, but this app doesn't bombard you with ads whatsoever! More than not, you can laugh, get worried, cry, and whatnot. Usually, the top comments alone can be funny. Kudos to those who made these entertaining pieces!"
"Everything is amazing. There's not really anything that's wrong with it, other than the coins. But I'm fine with waiting for episodes, it makes reading them more exciting, especially when you get that notification that one of your favorite Webtoons updated that you've been waiting for to be free"
"Webtoon is a reading platform much better than the others in that everything is free sooner or later. I also love the range and diversity webtoon has. Overall, webtoons is an amazing platform that I consider one of the best apps I have ever owned."
I really like it! I can save my videos and photos on here and then delete them from my phone saved in my photo app that way I can have more storage on my phone to update apps and install apps and such!! It has a 2gb limit...which is fine..cause I can use multiple emails. So far I haven't experienced any issues..thankfully. I can go back and visit my vids...I'm hoping it doesn't like not play or erase or something..since I do delete the vids from my samsung photo app.
"Yesterday my computer was taken over by ransomware and I lost thousands of photos and files. It also encrypted all my Dropbox and Google Drive files. I was told by the later that I just have to download, rename and reload each one individually! So heartbreaking and incredibly tedious time consuming task it will be. Once I started researching what it would take to restore prior versions to Dropbox, I found the Rewind functionality if I upgraded. I did so and now I have all those files back!"
"UPDATE 2/24/23 From 1 star to 5 stars: WORKS LIKE A CHARM! My friend sent me the tracks to his new album (VAI/GASH) via Dropbox & they're there! Plus I added documents & attachments from my phone! It works! ///Cannot find ANY of the documents I just ""Uploaded"" from my Android. I also tried ""Sharing"" documents directly from phone to Dropbox app-- which is an option, and only two files transferred. I tried doing them as a group of documents, and transferring one at a time. Still no luck."
"I don't like keeping a lot of pictures on my phone. Dropbox is an easy solution for that. Downloading the few pictures I do want to keep onto the app is easy and quick. I also really like that you can then access the pictures on your computer. I like Google photo, but the amount of pictures you can save on there is much less than dropbox."
"Great! Dropbox works exactly how you need it to, no confusing features or interfaces, easy file and folder sharing, with maximum control. I dislike OneDrive, Google Drive and Google Photos because I feel like those products try to take over everything I do, and copies my content to multiple places uncontrollably. Dropbox is the only cloud storage I feel my stuff is secure in, and doesn't try to force itself on you it just works in the background quietly and let's you focus on your work."
"User since 2012 - I recently did a factory reset and instead of installing from my list of apps under management I just typed in Dropbox. I'm writing after seeing the negative reviews. I've never been disappointed with my free account. I believe 14 devices later and still happy. I can easily share a single file or multiple folders to a single person, or group of people. I use on our PC and it keeps everything nice and synced. I'm not sure about the space they offer now, I've referred a lot."
"App works well, but could use some adjustments to the ui. For instance, downloading a file requires you to click on the three dots on the right of a file, and then scroll down to the export button. I didnt find this out till recently when I was contacted by the developers, so I originally just assumed that there wasn't a download button. Other than that, good app 👍"
"This a review for Dropbox as a whole. I couldn't find a place to leave a review for Dropbox, so here I am. I absolutely love Dropbox. The service works perfectly with no problems at all. The syncing software for PC and web version works flawlessly. Both the web version and desktop syncing software has all the features that I could possibly want. The mobile app is great too. Unparalleled."
"Dropbox provides seamless, real-time access and upload. I've used it regularly (phone and PC) for years with my personal files as well as file sharing in a small business and had 0 issues. It looks, feels, and operates like a local folder. It's secured with PIN access. The features and services have expanded over the years staying in step with a growing market. The only deterrent may be the cost. IMHO Dropbox is the best and I recommend hands-on to help make that decision."
"I'm so sick people telling me to send large media file via email. I've used this only once, help family and the interphase is easy. I was able to select the files I wanted to upload to the platform's cloud. Once the files are stored there I then select specific files or media that I wanted to share. It was able to then generate a link that allowed me to send it to a recipient to view only the items I selected. Being a link and then able to send it not only email but text too."
"I use the free version and love it. Pictures can fill it up fast, but for keeping documents and text files in a place where I can edit them on multiple devices it is indispensable! I can not afford what they charge monthly to increase my memory (this is personal, not business), but I make do with what I have and SO appreciate it!"
"I've been using Dropbox for around 5 years, it has been very useful, I like because I can work on any Microsoft document inside the app, and it doesn't modify how it looks when I open it outside the app. It's nice all your documents synchronized in different devices. Another thing that I prefer working on Dropbox rather than for example Google drive or One Drive is that you can download documents from the internet directly to your Dropbox. It allows you to attach docs directly from the app."
"Dropbox is a very convenient app. I have a desktop, a laptop and a cell phone. I am able to share files on all three devices no matter where I am. anyting I put in my shared file I can access anywhere. It is also cool because you can share large PDF files by sending a link to anybody you want. There are too many awesome features to mention!!"
I truly love this app. I have been using this app for years. Especially being able to store thousands and thousands of pictures and private files. Thanks for the option to be able to lock the app with a passcode. It works well with Microsoft Word when i want to edit my resumes or power point presentations. And i never had to pay for extra space. Thumbs up to the developers!!!👍👍👍
"Does what it's supposed to do, all the time, every time. TBH I rarely need to access my files on mobile but the times when I do, it works exactly the way it should. The main service itself is, of course, excellent. Also, for some reason, when opening downloaded PDFs it's an option to open them in DropBox, and I've found that's more readable than the other options; that's just a bonus."
I like this service with its pricing and usability but there are 2 things I dont like about it. When manually uploading it still uses cellular data. Dropbox cant automatically find duplicate files. I upload 100s of pictures weekly and I want to know if there are any duplicates from a misupload or other problem. I don't want to have to type for the date then time taken etc etc. I feel like having a better cloud file detection system would be beneficial. Plus it can be a toggleable setting.
"I use Dropbox every day in my business! I have it synced to my laptop and phone, so my files are constantly backed up. In addition, I use it as a vital tool for social media posting, as the 'export' feature makes it easy to post directly onto social media sites from my phone. In addition, I can share files and folders with clients and colleagues. Dropbox saves me time AND makes me more efficient. What more can I ask for?!"
"Love Dropbox App. Best App to have to sync your phoneand computer or laptop without having to install a bunch of apps that never work right or don't sync everything. Dropbox syncs photos, documents from the minute you upload them to your phone or laptop. You open up your laptop, everything you just tookpictures of is in the laptop app. The monthly price for extra storage, I think, is steep, so I download all my pics to an external disc to keep my storage at half capacity. Too pricey for me!"
"My phyiology professor uses this for his recorded lectures and Power Point slides. Drop Box functions very well, I have not had any problems. It seems to download and navigate very fast too. It is great to use if you are constantly uploading and sharing files, so perfect for professors and students."
"Dropbox is, to me, the best cloud storage platform available, and should be the gold standard for other platforms. But with that said, my reliance on it and its general utility to me has greatly diminished in recent years. It's expensive, the free storage limit is far too little, the limit on client installs/logins is heinous, and even if all that can be bought and remedied, it's still not HIPAA compliant, so I can't use it for work."
"I am very pleased with Dropbox; it's super easy to upload files from my devices, and super easy to access them on the app. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for additional storage space."
I trust this than a certain app advertising so much. And I really like the features! It's so good and helpful. I'm also thankful that they retain the original quality of my pics. This is really a lifesaver for people who have many photos or videos and you're storage is full. Thank you for developing this app!
"I am a Commercial Real Estate Broker, and I have been using Dropbox for years, because I can send a huge folder with documents or photos with just a link and I can control which people can view vs those that I let add or change the files..."
"Works fine on Windows 10, but keeps freezing on Android 13. Needs more work to be truly cross-platform. Update: following feedback from Dropbox, I followed their instructions and the app now works well. Thank you to Dropbox - fine service not always found nowadays!"
Great fun! Definitely sign up for the 3 hour tour as the hour long tour doesn't go to the ten thousand islands. Guide made sure we all understood how the cats operated. They take a little time to get the hang of operating them but they are a blast! I enjoyed them more than wave runners but that's just my opinion.
Had a subscription to Dropbox plus since Mar 2021. It will no longer sync saying I don't have dropbox plus but yet I still get charged $11.99 per month. Update: they resolved the issue after a few weeks. Thanks!
I love dropbox. There are no glitches. It runs smoothly. There are NO ads. It look good. Nobody nags you to purchase. It simply reminds when space is low. The free version is awesome for low storage.
"I have this program and I'm very happy with this application. It is great and worth the money and the time because this application takes care of my business needs. I'm able to save documents and I am safely able to open them up fast and saved to PDF format, which supports all email and legal documents."
"Dropbox is seamless and functional with my multiple computers and phone. I love that I don't have to think about keeping my critical files locally, I can just rely on a MacBook, a gaming PC, and an Android phone to share their files and have them available for my use."
"Dropbox are a tremendous company. Their skills are outstanding and the service they provide is life enhancing. I have loved everything about Dropbox in the many years that I have had an account with them. If you want to have a rewarding experience you should get an account with Dropbox, for they are experts in their specialized fields of knowledge."
"lots of storage it is dependable and transfers from one phone to another, and great for computers too."
"Drop Box is a good app. It's a good way to send material like audio samples and videos in case your regular email is over 25mb, which is the standard file size. Good job, Drop Box 👍🏿"
huge storage and helpful companion apps and can upload almost every type of document for important things in life... this is a cant miss app so download today!!
"Dropbox is actively being suppressed by Google, but... I love the functionality, quick syncing of files between devices, and have been saved many times by their rewind feature. It has also made sharing large files and folders with teammates and family a breeze. I have the paid service w/ over 2TB storage."
Stellar App! Dropbox is easy to use and updates files across devices seamlessly.
"I love Dropbox for its flexibility, and I enjoy using it for my general file management purposes. It is hands-down one of the best “productivity tools”, and provides people simpler solutions to keep organized, focused, and in sync with their teams. … or not, in reference to business. Dropbox can also be used for personal matters as well, and offers free and premium services for additional storage at great costs. Dropbox serves well and executes as expected. “Dropbox is a technological phenom”"
What a great 👍 resource. Easy to utilize and clearly organized. I like using this effective tool. It's especially good for large data transfer.
"Dropbox is the only app that I have consistently used in the past 10 years. It is the first thing I install on any new device whether Windows, Android or MacOS."
"Blank changelogs are extremely rude and disrespectful. We deserve to know what changes are happening on our devices. Start stating something meaningful and get your stars back. Edit: Meaningful changelogs appeared, returning stars as promised."
"Used Dropbox for years. Easy to upload files, manage files. Use across a couple devices. A great product."
Very pleased with the app. It does everything it claims and makes my life much easier when I need my files across multiple devices. Two thumbs up!
"I really like the back up of extra storage space for my phone ie photos videos contact s great worth the 9.99 £ for 1 months of extra storage maybe we should get more storage for the £9,99 monthly it is expensive for 100 gb"
I've been using Google for long enough it is too full to be reliable. I started using this and it works great. it even communicates well with my Linux PC
This app has treated me well over the years. I fact many years ago I got locked out of my account and just recently was able to gain a cess again. All my pictures were still there 🤠
"I have been utilizing Dropbox for over a decade now, and will continue to do so, as well as continuing to bring others into the fold in the process; in other words, I HIGHLY suggest it!"
"It's a good app overall. I would like it to be a little more space- But this is still great. Easy, simple. Thanks!"
"The Dropbox mobile app is a great tool for accessing and sharing files from your Dropbox storage on the go. It's easy to use and has a clean, user-friendly interface. Whether you need to send a file to a colleague or access an important document on the go, the Dropbox app has you covered. Overall, a valuable addition to any mobile device."
"I have used this application before you had to pay for it when I was with the Illinois Supreme Court for a place to store applications and data to run installations of software and data on remote systems. I still use the software for myself and I pay for it. I use it for my backup device for my android phone, apple table, PC desktop, and apple laptop. It is one price of software that I require ALL of my clients to buy before I will agree to help them with their computers. DropBox Works!!!!!"
I been using Dropbox for a year now and I'm very happy with the service provided to me . This app is easy to use and understand at the same time professional look and quality. Dropbox helps me stay extremely organized the way it should be I recommend Dropbox to all friends and family.
"Have used it since 2015 as a premium account. Apps work really well and are reliable on both Windows and Android. It does take time for Dropbox to sync with Windows. That said, I'd be stuck without it"
I've used Dropbox since it first started. Back when it wasn't so regulated you know? Haha glad it got some standards and will always use it. It's always been the first go to foe storage for me. All these complaints about video playback it's a storage app I've never played videos.
I really like and enjoy my Dropbox app because it gives me so many different choices especially with my photos and videos. I can even upgrade to get more data to download too! Kudos to Dropbox!
I like how I can organize my photos and videos. It makes things so much easier when I go to find certain ones.
Dropbox is my go to cloud storage. I can get to all my files from whichever device I am using.
love this app!! keeps all my patterns and files in one place. You can get to it through most programs/apps.
"Works smoothly and intuitively, and they're constantly updating it!! Thanks!"
"Drop box holds my most precious memories. Even after other devices became obsolete or damaged, Dropbox holds all those precious memories I hold dear."
"I dont know how i stayed this long without dropbox. Everything, in a single place. Simply awesome."
I've been using this for years. It's been great way to access my files across platforms. I frequently highly recommend it to others.
Very useful. Dropbox has been my cloud server for more than 5 years and it hasn't failed me.
"Very Versatile and easy to share folders, files, and links to files allowing ""edit"" or ""view only."" Also, select specific people who can edit or view only or create a link that works for everyone."
"Great service, nice and secure, haven't had a problem with it yet and I have been using it for several years."
"This has always been my backup for irreplaceable files, documents and photos. I have relied on it for many years now."
Amazing app I love it to bits though I wish you tone down the monthly subscription just a bit other than that 👍
This app has been excellent for accessing files between my laptop and phone.
probably the cloud app that i get a subscription for most times.. a good go to if you dont use google or microsoft for the sign up.
fastest cloud file sync out of multiple competitors! highly recommend!
Feeling not to good because I don't have a credit card on file. When 30 days free trail is over ???????????????????????????????????????????????💩💩💩3🧐😂😂😂😂
Love Dropbox. Has saved so many memories for me that would have otherwise been lost to time. Thanks
"I've had Dropbox for many years and it has never let me down. Just today I came across photos and videos I'd forgotten all about. It brought back happy times that Dropbox had kept safely stored for me from all those years ago. Thank you, Dropbox for keeping my memories alive and safe 🙂❤️🙂"
"Absolutely brilliant!! It carries out a wide range of complex tasks in a very simple way and extremely quickly. I installed it on my new (secondhand Android) phone and installed it on my w7 notebook, and it works like a charm! I'd been having problems with the phone's sharing mechanism (to PC), resulting in an overfull memory, so this was a way round it. I'll almost certainly upgrade to the premium version."
"Dropbox is an excellent tool for people who work on multiple devices, or on files that are updated by the MIS team backend. Also since it is cloud based, files are accessible from any device. I have been using this for the last 9 years and am very satisfied. In these last 9 years though my systems collapsed, i never lost my data since it was on Dropbox."
I'm very happy with the small or big cute details that I have. I'm never going back to Google Drive again.
"Simply the best cloud storage app in the world and I thank you sincerely for all your amazing work. It is simple, fast, convenient, good looking, functional, adaptive, and works very well. 🌟 I love to use Dropbox and the use of it helped me many times not only to backup what I wanted, but also to upload files from Dropbox into where I wanted, and that helped me many times. However, I want to have a choice for a small paid plan such as maybe 10GB to 20GB for a personal use."
"Definitely the best cloud storage out there. I used it as my first one ever and was impressed. After sometime wandering around, here I am coming back. Although the storage is only 2GB, which is insufficient for our day and age; the performance is highly compensating for it. The upgrades are convenient in case you need more space. Truth is, I was taken aback by its ability to read epub files when I would normally have to download extra applications for it. Thanks for your work."
"for someone like me, it's very useful app for storing data like images, audio file, video and to embed it in webpages too... it's overall, a great app"
"love it, easy to use. perfect when you have to access data quick."
Good but we want some low price for storage and also many other plan like 100 GB plan You should give plan like google one
Absolutely love this. Makes it so easy to access for different devices.
"Very easy to use and lots of free space with optional Xtra,s. Nice and friendly updates."
"Great storage, easier to use than Drive! I often have problems finding my photos an documents on Google drive but Dropbox has a really simple interface. I've found things in here where I could not find on Drive. Gives options to tag, share links,file items. But it's so simple to find things and not difficult to navigate around either. I would rather use this as storage. Had no problems so far. Free storage and as usual the same as most clouds, has options to pay for more storage"
I love Dropbox! It's extremely helpful in managing my various buckets of data!
Procedure change from prior payment Schedule changed to Monthly payment Schedule. As needed. Verizon is not exempt.
"the app is very safe for your documents, it will help you keep your documents for future purpose. I love it"
Excellent way to organize our business's important documents & ensure shared access to the people who need it.
I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST APP FOR STUDENTS AND FOR PEOPLE WHO DEAL WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF FILES REGULARLY AND ARE STRUGGLING TO ORGANIZE THEM.
Dropbox is great. I really count on it.
"I have been using this App for the last 10 years. However, this days i couldn't upload new files in it. So is there something i should do?"
The most reliable and easy to use across all my devices.
"So far so good. Considering the mediocre mobile apps for Google Drive and OneDrive, this Dropbox app is a welcome departure. It's snappy, sensibly laid out, has a great PDF reader and has decent swiping navigation. The only thing I'd like to see added is being able to select the exact device folders for syncing images and files, and a photo view that is optimised to look beautiful and like a gallery."
absolutely love being able to store and retrieve everything in this platform.
"I love this app, I've been using it for years and when I got close to my limit at the end of 2018, I purchased the premium package and got like a Terabyte or so of space. I can't imagine filling that amount with pictures and video (I have only a few documents that need to be stored). This app is quite inexpensive for what you get and I would (and have) recommend this app to anyone that has precious info, pics, docs or whatever that needs to be saved in an off site location."
personal use. Great for sharing small files between PC and mobile
Good app . It stored my data for a very long time. I'm very happy to see my memories ❤️. Thanks
The ONLINE & OFFLINE storage and transferring service has a monthly or annual service charge to use the full benefits HOWEVER the Free limited access is still Exceptional and worth use!
I used Dropbox for many years! All that time I have enjoyed using it!
Really useful app - pl develop app for multi tasking window - it should not be closed while another work performing
Love this app. Great to keep and have all your pictures & videos for years and years
Just awesome to have all my memories in one place with easier access.
this is such a useful app to store documents and downloads. love it.
"Everything is good I love to read ! But at times it can be frustrating when I get into a book and have to use coins to open the book.. you can also look at 2 videos to continue reading, which helps for a bit.. But I would just like to continue reading but when everything is done I can't until next day! But over all love the app.. could do with fewer ads but all good keep up the good job!"
"I am an avid reader and I really enjoy the variety that this app offers. I am also pleased with the upgrades with the portion to get coins. I would however love it if the complete novels that have audio capability would complete the audible portions as well as the written portion. I am one who likes to listen and read simultaneously. Also if my eyes get tired, I can rest them while listening to the book and then pick back up with the reading portion."
It's got some great books. I feel like I could go buy a book at the store for less then the price of finishing the story in the app. It's a little annoying only being able to read a short chapter at a time unless you spend money to continually read but that only lasts so long. Definitely recommend some of the books on here though. They definitely hook you in. Wish they had more adds to get through chapters instead of having to pay
"I like the app, the coin and bonus part gets a little frustrating when you're into a really good book and run out at a intense part. It would be better to do a membership and do away with the coin aspect. Personally I'd rather pay a monthly fee to read unlimited books rather then pay per so many chapters. Overall really like the books but wish there were other rewards for reading."
"Enjoy the variety of the app as well as having both audible and good ole fashioned reading. Nice to have the option, but the app is too expensive. Need more coin earning options or better discounts that allow to download. I was reading a free story, was unable to download. Also wasn't free as it still took my coins for payment. THAT is a total rip off. Wish the coins, service and payments were as awesome as the variety."
"Good but can end up being pricey depending on how many chapters the book is. I enjoy reading longer novels but at a certain point it's too much. I wish there was an exchange rate from gems to coins. The selection is awesome and there's something for everyone. It's mostly romance but a lot of different genres/topics. Depending on the author, the books are all pretty good reads."
"The book I'm currently reading is awesome. However, it has over 2000 chapters. I've never seen a book like that. I do have concerns like the chapters are super short and the costs associated are not cheap. The check-in, ads, and other bonus opportunities are too little and don't allow for a full chapter. I think it could be more given than taken. Again, the book is great. I can visualize the characters and become emotionally connected,but I can not afford over 2000 chapters."
"I have enjoyed finding new stories. Sometimes the coins needed to read a book are a little extreme or the author makes the chapters too short. But for the most part, I enjoy the brief escape I get each day with my lunch reading. Only other downside is the timer doesn't always track correctly. I will have read for 15 mins and it only shows 9 counted."
"I love this reading app. I'll admit, I have a few different reading apps that I use. Different app for different genres I guess. And to this day, Goodnovel is by far my first choice to go to for my reading experience. The only thing that I can honestly say that could be improved would be the amount of coins needed to complete the stories. Sometimes it takes way to long to complete the books I like waiting for the correct amount of coins needed to unlock the next chapter...unless you buy coins."
"The storyline is engaging. The purchase of coins to continue is frustrating. The price of books and chapters should be made clear with options to purchase books at the beginning. The time it takes to jump through hoops to aquire coins could better be spent reading the book. It's breaks the concentration and takes away from the story. This is not agreeable for an avid reader one chapter a day.. but if that's all you have time for, then perfect for you."
"This app has many great stories. There are some I am currently reading that are so good, that I get mad because I don't have enough coins or I used up my ads to unlock chapters without realizing it, until the ad box is gray. Overall, its a really good app. I love that you can watch one ad to unlock one chapter without using your coins. You get 2 ads to unlock 2 chapters per book. Its fantastic. 10/10 highly recommend!"
"Hi, so I don't like spending a lot on books that aren't the old fashioned in hand books but this app is good. I like the authors and the fact I'm a speed reader I wish there were more other ways to earn free chapters. I have 4-6 different reading apps and willingly keep the ones I feel are worth it. This app is one of my top 3 apps for reading while on the road. Saves space too. So definitely keep in mind your priorities when it comes to spending money on books."
GoodNovel is a great way to unwind and take moment to relax and enjoy some reading. It is frustrating sometimes when you reach your limit to continue reading and having to purchase extra time. But all in all it does have options to get extra points to continue if you can't purchase more points!
"I enjoy this app, the only thing feel would make it better would be after watching an ad for you to be able to read more than one chapter, or that when you start a novel that's ""free"" then it should remain free until your finished. I've also had difficulty getting it to load the videos for the ads"
"My experience is fine, but it's too costly to continue reading. But the reading is superb. The book is really intriguing. The contrast with the characters is great to a point. However, I believe they need to be boundaries, and I felt there were miminal between the characters"
"Gonna be honest, this is one of the easier apps to use for this type of the platform. Some of the writers need to take a few more English classes, but you can get the drift of what they're saying. Overall... ease of use 5 stars. Daily bonuses... definitely 5 stars... story lines... 5 stars... grammatical errors... 2. I seriously want to be their proof reader to help with spelling and punctuation."
I live the books that are offered. One thing I don't like is having to buy all the coins because I'm to Impatient to not read the whole book at once. If it offered more ways to get the coins or less spent on each chapter it would really be better in my opinion. But overall it is a wonderful app with great books.
This app Good Novel has some very good stories that keep you wanting to read more however the downside is when you're deep into the story and then the locked screen appears meaning you must pay to continue reading. I wish there were more ways to earn coins . The authors really need to double check there grammar and the double talk along with mixing up the character's names. This is still an awesome app even with all the flaws because the good out weighs the bad
Love the books but the coin thing is really the problem. I know the writers are doing it for pay but at least give some chapters for free. The prices are reasonable but at the same time high. The bonus coins are good but if they could last at least for the month without expiring it would be better. Not everyone can pay all the time. It would help book lovers to want to pay when they can. Which would also help the writers to get new readers if all work together.
"Thr GoodNovel App is worth the download. They have books based on different genres. The Footballer's Baby is one of the books that is an excellent collection of stories that were written well, but, some of the storyline's or stories felt incomplete. This thought prompted me to continue reading the book until its end. My hope was to return to the stories and complete them. That was not an option. However, I encourage you to read and enjoy the stories for yourself just like I did. You will indeed."
"I know a lot of people are annoyed with the coins. Yeah, it sucks when you run out at a good part, but not everyone can afford a monthly fee. I love the variety of books. I wish you could earn more coins in another way. But at least I can read two sections of a book with the ads, since I can not waste too much of my money just to read a book. There really had been only one book I couldn't finish since I downloaded it. Needless to say I very much enjoy this app."
It is a simple to use app but does require the purchase of coins to keep reading the stories. It has a wide range of genres which makes it easy to love. I do wish that when they run coin purchase specials that it encompasses a woder ramge of values. Their coin purchase specials are way to high for my wallet.
"This is the best story I have read so far. It has a lot of plot twists and an interesting story that can teach us all a lesson. Not to mention that you should judge people on how much money they have but other more important things. Like any other great story, it has its twists and turns. As the adventure of Charlie wade develops in a nonstopping action-pack plot. Please read it cause it could change your outlook on a lot of things that your thoughts before."
"PRO: I stumbled across Goodnovel because of another eReader, I will say Goodnovel has the better selection of both books and much better Authors, I will also say that I like the lay out and better prices, you get more coins for what you pay, I also love that chapters don't cost an arm and a leg when I have to buy per chapter when I dont have enough coins to unlock the whole book. CON: My only complaint is how much of a pain it is to turn the auto unlock off. I wish it was easier to turn off."
I was reading an portion of a book off of Facebook one day. The link was broke so I had done a major quest to find it. I had nearly given up when I found goodnovel. I love that there is many books to read. The platform is extremely easy to use and if you wish to buy coins the prices are better then other platforms.
This app has some interesting stories. They def need to have some of the authors seek an editor (which I am) for simple mistakes in the books. Overall it's an easy going and easily usable app. My only upset besides the editing that needs to be done is the price for books. The coin situation may not be enough for one book. Also coins are expensive and having to always buy is frustrating.
"It's a pretty easy app to use, and most of the stories are well written. Some are truly amazing and addicting. I have 2 issues with this app. 1st are the bonus coins. They get taken away even after they have been issued. For instance, today, I unlocked 25 points, and i have 5 days to use them, but when i went to use them, they were already gone. 2nd is the price for each chapter changes. The app knows how many coins you have. The more you have, the more it costs to read the rhe next chapter."
"Tap into a different world of books with this app. It's loaded up with supernatural tales. The menu navigation is a bit clunky. I find that the color scheme makes it hard to read some of the pages. One can read for free if one is patient, but it feels like fewer options to earn points in the points system."
"This app has some of my favorite books! It has everything from paranormal to suspenseful drama and romance! Definitely a place to get my werewolf fix! It's easy to aquire bonus coins to unlock new chapters and there are so many options that I can never just read one book at a time! As an avid reader and a quiet myself I can honestly say if you haven't tried this app, you are seriously missing out!"
I really love all the different fantasy novels on this app. HEADS UP BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD!!!! These books are NOT all free. You have to pay to get coins and then use the coins to read more chapters. However the books draw you in so well that you won't even notice. Yes the price is sorta high but for someone who's capable not an issue. If you don't want to pay thru have other options too. Over all I love it. And I'm glad it gives me something to read every day.
Pretty okay. The stories are really great. The only thing I really find frustrating is I'm on a limited income and I realize other people including authors have to make money but I feel like paying for points to continue to read a novel is a bit much but I totally get it. It's good quality reading and the prices themselves for the coins and bonus points really aren't that bad. But if I could change one thing I'd change how far into the book you let someone read before stopping. I'd give them 1hr
"The stories on this app are great, you start reading the first few chapters and instantly become hooked. The only negative; is that you have to accumulate coins in order to continue to read. While you are given options to recieve coins free of charge; they run out quickly. If your a fast reader it sucks, you have to read a little each day or multiple books at a time. Some grammatical errors throughout but can be overlooked."
"So far, the app is working well. I wish the reading bonuses were more points. They really aren't enough to make you want to hit the reading bonus. The daily check-in bonuses are a decent amount of points. Enough to make you want to check in. Three stories I've started are enjoyable so far with very few grammatical problems. To unlock the chapters, some are a little pricey and deter me from wanting to continue the story. For a point system reading, it's not the worst I've encountered."
"I don't normally give too many reviews. The app works really well. It is bug free so far. I like the story I have been reading so far but may have to quit soon because it is just too expensive to keep having to pay on order to keep reading the story. It's not like you are paying one time to read the story, but every few chapters. Yes, the give bonus credits but it doesn't overall it's minimal savings Ex. 400 short chapters have cost almost $100. That's w/ bonuses. Really ridiculously expensive."
The stories that I have been reading so far have been thoroughly enjoyable and in some cases rather difficult to put down (with only a little bit of editing they could easily find a place on anyone's best-sellers list!) My one complaint is that I can't always advance to the next chapter as quickly as I would like to some times without buying credits.
This app has some good stories with substance. That being said there are many grammatical errors and many word choices that do not make sense. The cost/bonus system is also set up more than other apps I have read from before. A lot of the stories sound exactly the same with different names and minor detail changes but if you see that and skip past those stories and move on they have plenty of options to chose from.
"Pros There are some interesting titles here and it makes a great escape. I read on my cell with no issues. The biggest con is that it uses a coin system for reading and there are ways of earning free coins but if you are an avid or fast reader the amount of daily free coins isn't nearly enough. Some titles have thousands of chapters, which is good, but with the coin system used around 15 coins let's you read 2-3 at a time. Also, there isn't an option to purchase the right to read the whole book."
"The app is good overall, with no crashing or excessive ads. I really like the material that's recommended as it aligns with the genre of reading I like. I don't like that there is no place to figure out exactly how many coins it will take to read an entire book, which ends up costing a fortune. Additionally, there should be some other ways to earn more coins faster."
"Overall, I like the app but you have to either purchase coins/points to keep reading a book. They do give you chances to get points or bonuses but they are limited. Therefore, the you can only read very little daily and have to wait for more opportunities to get points. Some of the books seem never ending. They do have plenty of reading genres and books to choose from."
"Great reading! The ""books"" are an easy read. Some of the stories are a mirror of each other, but, it doesn't take long to figure out what ones are duplicates. Definitely slow moving through the ones you like due to the system. The book I'm reading now is ""A Virgin For The Player"", very intriguing. Easy read. Easier to follow."
"I truly enjoy all the novels I am currently reading. I'm given extensive details in the plot and the authors put wonderfully descriptive details of the settings and surroundings for the story so that any reader at any reading level can imagine and see the beautiful landscape, physical attributes of the characters and settings. Sights, sounds and textures of every aspect of the story come through with ease."
"I like the app, and the stories are captivating. The chapters have to be unlocked with coins or bonuses, which you can get daily bonuses. Buying coins can be expensive in the long run even though you get a bonus on top depending on which package you buy. All in all, I like the app and design, but more importantly, there are amazing stories on there to read."
"I love this free novel app. I love the stories and the wide selection of themes. You can get gems that you can use to boost the popularity of your favorite books. This really helps the authors be seen by other users. The longer you use the app more options to get free chapters will be provided. Yes, you would have to see a short ad to get the free chapter but it is totally up to you. There are no ad interpretation while reading the books. This is my favorite part. I hate being interperted."
"I like the app, the coin and bonus part gets a little frustrating when you're into a really good book and run out at a intense part. Though that app has some great titles and authors. It would be better to do a membership and do away with the coin aspect. Personally I'd rather pay a monthly fee to read unlimited books rather then pay per so many chapters."
"Stories are not bad, and there is a pretty good variety. Unfortunately, the chapters are very short, and the ""clock"" for how long you read does not seem very accurate. The books are mostly well written, but most don't seem to have an editor. I enjoy using the app and getting the free point attached to reading for a certain amount of time."
"I like the app but I just wish I could earn more coins each day so I can read a few more chapters each day sometimes it gets frustrating only reading 1 or 2 maybe 3 chapters a day, but I love the stories on this app, some apps advertise shifter book but really don't have very many on the actual app. I love how there are not a lot of ads that pop up in between pages"
"Great novel selection. I enjoy garnering points towards reading chapters. And am pleased with being able to watch videos in order to unlock chapters. However, I do wish we were at least able to unlock 3 or 4 chapters with the videos. The books are definitely an interesting read, but I would also like to have the option of purchasing the book in its entirety. Adding games to earn points would be a nice touch to the app for more reading."
"Good novel has various eye-catching stories that will help you pass the time. I truly enjoy reading them during a break. The only down fall is the spending money on the coins to continue. Overall, I know it helps with paying the writers and stuff. I just wish they were just a little cheaper. 😔 like I said, good app for good reading and time passing."
"Novels are intriguing and keep the readers attention to keep reading. However, one has to ""pay"" for each chapter to continue through the book. Each chapter is typically only a paragraph or two and the more you read the more you have to pay each chapter. Interesting way to keep the readers hooked to continue to receive revenue. I wish you could just pay a lump sum for each book like kindle."
Total rip off. Good material but shouldn't have to pay the rate they want to read a book. You can easily spend $50 plus trying to read one of these novels. Plus they can't do math. You get points for checking in and then points if you watch the videos yeah you almost have to repopulate your balance every time or they will totally screw you.
"I like the variety of books. However, I don't like how the coin system works. When I purchase a big amount it seems that the cost of the chapters go up. My coins disappear much quicker than if I was to get the free ones. Also the chapters should all cost the same in all the books. I will jump from one book to another and one chapter in 1 will cost 22 coins but in the other book 14. Make it consistent. I do love the books they all have held my attention and have a good story line."
"I love the app! I gave it 5 stars because of the good variety of books that will easily get you immersed in reading. However, purchasing chapters or waiting until bonus points are equivalent to the cost of a chapter is frustrating! Not everyone can afford to buy these chapters which turns out to cost more than if you purchase the book at one go. There are hundreds of chapters per book!"
"Great, with a catch. I love reading the stories, but it does start to get expensive. If you only collect daily points, you'll only get maybe a chapter a day. Keep an eye out for deals on points, as they do change every once in awhile. I love how long these books can go because I love characters easily and don't want to let them go. All in all, worth it."
I have tried many other reading apps and Goodnovel is by far my favorite. It's easy to navigate and the very limited ads are actually useful in suggesting other books in genres I like. Chapters are a descent length for the cost. The rewards are easy to earn. There are good deals and sales. There are even opportunities to read for free. Definitely recommend this app for anyone who loves to read.
This is a great app. There are a lot of talented authors and a great selection to choose from. With daily check in and if you read at least 30 minutes you get credit for the chapters. Otherwise it get kinda expensive if you're in a good story and can't wait. I would have given 5 stars but there is always room for improvement plus I think there should be more ways to earn higher amounts of credit or more frequent without paying. But even still great app!
"Great app for discovering new books and authors. I dont like that the time zone is off from mine, and that when trying to get the 30 mins of reading bonus it takes and hour, esp. since unless you are willing to pay for coins you never have enough to read that long. I did purchase the $1.99 bundle today so that I could read longer and have been reading on and off all day. Other than these issues the appbus very well set up, easy to navigate, and I'm able to easily access the books I'm Reading."
Love the variety of books on here. Great stories. I do think that you should be able to read as much or as little as you want. I think having to have so many coins is a little Ridiculous. You could do a daily check in . Do ads after every chapter to unlock them. But the coins are to expensive. Doing the other little thing to earn coins is fine as well . But just do ads to unlock the ads. Should be able to enjoy the books. Some people reading is the only thing should not be so expensive
"The stories are gripping and interesting, though honestly they often contain grammar and punctuation errors like they weren't even proofread. I like the options to earn free coins but there aren't many and I sometimes have to do tasks twice. I dont like the auto buy feature with coins and I can't seem to turn it off even after clicking the uncheck box. The actual price of coins/chapters is expensive."
"The stories I have began are good and have a few grammatical errors. No glitches so far. I've started 5 books and haven't finished any of them because chapters are so expensive and super short! I've spent $44.98 USD, and I have NOT BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETE READING A BOOK! Daily bonuses should be more for reading and checking in. I'm going to give up and uninstall this app very soon! This is ridiculous!"
I like that the app allows you to write your novel. The chapters are very long and while most books are exciting to read it takes a long time to get to a point. Like over 2000 chapters could have been several books instead of 1 long drawn-out book. And you're going to have to pay something to unlock the next chapter. They give coins that can be used. But that only last so long. Good concept though.
As far as apps go where you have to pay to read I would say this is one of the better ones I gave it 5 stars mostly for I have never once experienced problems with purchasing or being credited coins when do. (I have been using the app for about 2 years) Unlike many other apps where you have to go through so much trouble for something you've already paid for.
I love Good Novel. The amateur writers that publish here are far from actual amateurs. I have discovered some of my now favorite stories on this app. The best part is that there are constantly new stories to read. The only thing I would change is how the stories are updated by daily chapters. I am impatient and in a good book I love to get lost in the chapters and with unfinished stories you can't do that. U can read a new chapter or two weekly sometimes daily depending on the writer
I love the app. It is easy to use and set up to find what you are looking for with ease. I could read these books for days and be completely content. The only bad thing about this app is it can get expensive but the bonuses help and they always have reduced books or free if you look. The authors are very talented and you will get lost on the characters they create. This app has plenty of great books for everyone to get lost in when you need a break!!!
"I like being able to read the books on here and support the authors. But I wish there was more ways to earn points. I am on a budget, and can't afford to buy coins to finish a book. It is too expensive. I wished that I could watch more than two ads to unlock chapters. Like unlimited ad watching to read an entire book."
"I've only had this app for about a week. Lots of choices and very interesting books. The only problem I find is that it takes alot of coins to read these stories. I was so interested and involved in the story that I purchased coins which, seem very expensive because still didn't get me far. I must say that I do enjoy and will continue. Earning daily coins helps. I'm just asking myself..how long it will take to just get one book read at this rate."
"Soooo many good novels and reads. I came across Goodnovel by way of fb as I started reading a novel. When the novel came to an end on that app, I quickly downloaded the Goodnovel app so I could continue reading the book which already had me hooked. I continued reading a few chapters only to have the next chapters locked. This is a good idea to keep readers coming back to finish a novel, except for the fact you can only earn very few each day. Very frustrating."
There are a ton of great stories to choose from. I am hooked on when his eyes. opened right now. However the coin system is horrible. I am avid and fast reader and having to wait the next day to collect coins to even read a chapter or two is not fun. I have several novels started and just waiting to be finished due to not having enough coins to continue. Some of us don't have the extra cash to spend in the store to make the reading easier. I do enjoy this app thou other then that only flaw.
"So far it's a great app. I really like the stories about the werewolves, I've liked werewolf movies so I was happy to start reading. I just have a couple complaints... First, I can't handle sometimes how bad grammar is. Second, the ""bonus"" money system is annoying. I just want to read the whole book!"
"They have a nice selection to choose from. I just haven't started reading other books yet because the one I'm currently on has over 2,000 chapters. It's really good which is why I haven't deleted this app although earning coins is very slow and you will definitely pay over $20 to read a few chapters so way more expensive than if you went and purched a book in store. I honestly wish you could read more for a cheaper priced &earn more coins easily. Plus it says read for 45 mins which isn't 45 mins"
Reallt like this app. It has a huge library of books to choose from and most of the ones I have chosen to read are really great. The only downside is the cost to complete reading these books. There should be more ways to earn coins or even a monthly fee for a subscription. I get invested in a story and pay eay more than if I would have to pay for an actual hard copy.
"The stories in this app are the kind to get your attention and leave you wanting to read more. Although, the app makes it where you need bonus points or awards and coins to get more chapters to read. But it doesn't really bother me for I don't use the appt ALL the time, plus, I'm not one to keep my phone in my hands all day everyday! It's a good time killer when it needs to be!"
"Love the novels I am reading on this app. I got sucked into a book on Facebook and wanted to finish it, that is where I got exposed to the app. At first I was turned off by the point system to freely unlocking chapters to my novel...however the books are so good that I ended up purchasing some coin and with the bonus coin it works. If i were to buy the book it would be same same is how i look at it. I wish they gave you more opportunity to get more free points ts is my only complaint."
"I only get to read a few chapters a night. I have to depend on the check in bonus. I can't afford $20 in 2 days as I'm a fast reader, and the money doesn't last long. I put $40 into one book. Way too rich for my blood. The app is easy to use but I find many books are the same in several apps, the writer just changes the character names. Some times they miss a name change and the book is confusing using the wrong name in a few paragraphs"
I was hooked almost immediately after reading some free chapters on Facebook and I have been doing my best to NOT spend $50 trying to read a simple book but I can't help it. I have already put at least $25 to read not even half of a book that isn't edited properly and you have to pay per chapter and those vary as well. It has many books to choose from so I will have to shuffle through some to be able to finish them although I have a feeling that it will take a while...
"This is a good app.... If you are rich or are a poor reader. The ""rewards"" get you a chapter or two unlocked a day. If you want to read more, you have to purchase coins/points. Most stories are full of grammatical errors. And, as an avid reader, I can usually finish a physical copy of a novel (A Christina Feehan's Carpathian book, for example) in a few hours. So, only reading a chapter or two is a nuisance. The only reason I gave 5⭐is because you have to, to get 20 more bonus. 😩"
"Addictive!! I have only read one book, but I am enjoying it. There are hundreds of options to choose and a variety of different genres. Some authors can get a bit chapter happy and upload thousands of chapters to attempt to keep you in their book, but you can always choose completed books. You can purchase coins to open chapters, but there are options to receive free coins and daily bonuses. Overall I enjoy the app and read everyday."
The stories are absolutely amazing 😍. I was worried I would have to pay to be able to finish the story that caught my attention at first but as long as I have some patience I earn the coins in a decent time frame to continue happily. I wish there were more ways to earn coins or that they had a complete coin free book once in awhile but understand. Still an awesome app because between reading my main one I can start others and see if they spark my interest which most have! I could write more 😅
App is easy to navigate. 3rd party ads don't show up unless you want to unlock bonuses. You need bonuses to get started on the next chapter. Remember to check in daily on the rewards section to claim and get bonuses. There are different ways of unlocking bonuses including the purchase of said bonuses. Books have grammatical errors from time to time.
Some of the stories have a lot of potential and are able to hold my interest. I like that you have other options to claim coins then purchasing them but some of the chapters are not priced appropriately. It can take like 2 days of claiming free coins to open one short chapter that ends up being filler and not impacting the story. It is a good way to try out the story before purchasing it since the first so many chapters are free but I would like the option to just buy a story in full.
"So the app is great. You can read many different stories and even write your own if you like. Though there is a coin system, you can also watch ads to unlock some chapters. It might take a while to get through your favorite story if you don't wish to pay for it but it is easier than paying almost 300 dollars to unlock everything. So, yes some stories can get up in the hundreds of dollars to unlock the entire thing, or you can just do your daily check ins and get those coins. Then read forever"
"I love the stories written in this app. I get lost in a few books but it keeps my attention longer then expected. Writers are great, not your in store, looked over perfect books and I ove the rawness of it. I'm not exited about how the coin seems to rise the more I read to unlock chapters. I feel the earned points should be raised, it takes too long to earn points when chapters get to 40+ coin. Otherwise love it!"
"Tbh the whole having to either pay for coins or wait an eternity to save enough bonus to read the books can get a bit frustrating. However, the app is still amazing and has helped me find my love for reading back to me, so I'm grateful for that. There are so many books on the app that have amazing story lines and that can truly take you out of reality for a while."
I really am enjoying the book that I am reading. I'm not sure how I started this reading app. It really is not very user friendly. I would like to know how many more chapters I need to read to finish the book. I'm only following along through the free reading on a daily basis. I've been reading for 60+ days. The story is enough to hold my interest but it would be more enjoyable if I could read more at 1 setting. Kinda frustrating. I would purchase but other reviews say it's pricey.
"I really am enjoying reading the books on here, but wish we didn't have to buy time to read or have to wait to collect points to continue reading them. Struggling as it is, it would be nice to relax and read a book I am into longer than just a chapter at a time. I have found multiple stories rhat I have come to enjoy, hard just to read one, but would like to get the one I am reading first completed. It has over 2600 chapters."
I am thoroughly enjoying reading using GoodNovel. Excellent selection and the ease of use is awesome. only drawback is that it's too easy to comment (you can accidentally bring up the commentary option just by hovering a finger too long or accidentally doubletapping while scrolling.) Other than that I'm absolutely enjoying using this app to read.
"The App is good. No unnecessary advertisements disturb while reading on the App. The stories are captivating and keeps one addicted to it. The issue I have with the payment. It's expensive to keep reading and the stories are too long... Aside from that, it's good and keeps me away from other Apps😀"
The app works well. There are no bugs and pretty easy to maneuver. Downfall is that it is so expensive to read the books! I wish it was cheaper as I would love to read some of these stories to completion but can't bring myself to spend that much but as a whole the app is great and great stories.
The app is free but you can only read a couple chapters a day unless you want to pay. The points are nice but when each chapter costs 20+ points it takes a while to get through a book. Normaly I would be done with a whole novel within a few days. This makes it take a long time but you can read several books at once if you want to. It is a nice concept But the app needs work. You get points for reading for 15 min and for 30 min on the app. It doesn't go past that though. 20 points for giving 5 ☆
"This app is a great way to read Romance and sci-fi novels at your own pace, read the first few chapters and develop a sense of writing style from the authors, all without necessarily purchasing the book first. The only thing that is distracting is the spelling/grammar errors and occasional misspelling of characters. Otherwise it's a great app."
"Goodnovel is a reading app that offers a wide selection of novels and stories in various genres. The app has a user-friendly interface and provides a personalized reading experience with customized recommendations. The reading experience is enjoyable and immersive, and users can adjust the font size and background color to their liking. However, the app does contain ads that can sometimes be intrusive. Overall, Goodnovel is a great app for readers who want a diverse selection of stories ."
"This is my go to and favourite reading app for everything related to fantasy and steamy novels. Sometimes maybe we get frustrated when we don't have enough points to unlock a new chapter, but the wait is only until the next day. Sometimes, in all honesty, I do find the chapters a bit too 'expensive' to unlock...but that is the only thing for me. Great app, easy to use, nice to adjust for personal preference."
"There are lots of novel that are very interesting and i personally like reading them. Once I started to read, i don't want to stop. The only thing that stop me from reading is, i run out of coins. This is my only concern, it is expensive to finish one book. Usually 22 coins for 2 chapters and each chapter is not long enough. Like, only 1 page for 1 chapter. How I wish I can purchase the book itself. Overall, great apps and there are many books to choose from."
"It's honestly one of the better reading apps I've found. There's actual grammar editing to provide proper punctuation and the chapters aren't crazy pricy for only 2 pages. However, I would like to see some other ways of gaining coins in app or unlocking the books faster. I don't really want to keep buying coins or otherwise be forced to only read one chapter every 2 days."
"I love reading novels from this app as you can get a lot more books than other ones. Some books can be a bit expensive, but some of the other apps are way more than this one. The books that I have read on here some are page turners where you can't stop reading it. One thin I don't like are the unfinished books,and they never update that's not fair to the readers when you spend money to read the book. Maybe not allow books to be published until it's finished or agree to update so many days a week"
This app is one of my favourites has so many different books to read. Love that they are all different from other books I have read. The only down fall is having to spend so much money to ready the books and then running out of coins then having to wait to get your free check in which I feel is abit small as we have spent so much money to read the book in the first place.
"Very well written. I can't stop reading it. And almost everything in the story extremely exciting to get to the end of the chapter. But when you get to end of the chapter, the story keeps on going. So it's like you chasing the unknown ending. But that's what make the story interesting. The fact that you want to finished read the story but the cooties still coming from chapter to chapter. And very well balanced. I mean that everything and every words and every movement in the story felt so real.."
"Great app to download, most of the books are completed and I personally don't think that to buy coins are to expensive. I would like to see a wider range of fantasy though and do wish they had more ways of earning more free chapters. Not many writing errors or repeating the same chapter twice which I've seen in different apps so that's nice."
I love the content of the stories. However it costs a fortune. I can't afford it. Lose interest a chapter a day I can buy a hard copy cheaper. I spent 100 dollars and could not finish. That is ridiculous. I fell into another book. Said it was free. Same thing. Getting ready to delete the app again!
"I have only been using this app for a couple weeks now but so far it's ok. I like the books being in such detailed categories but that's pretty much where it ends. The costs to unlock new chapters are almost always double as what's on a different app. The other problem is there is basically no way to earn big rewards continuously, if you want to keep reading you have to buy coins or claim your daily rewards and wait weeks do read a few chapters"
The app has really well written books. The stories here are amazing and I can't stop reading. The coin prices for the books aren't to high. I wish we could earn more coins at a time but other than that it is reasonable. I like that some stories or most stories you can unlock a chapter by watching an ad. All in all it is a good app.
The app is a good one. It makes it easy for me to display my business category However they are some categories of my business that hasn't been approved and it's taking longer than expected. I would also appreciate if the UI can be upgraded in such a way that there's a UI for chats and a separate UI for groups. The way it is currently make the messages congested and hard to differentiate.
"It's a nice app. But could you please add the option of messaging someone directly from status views. Its useful for those who have too many contacts and , I would have to back it up and search for the person's name on my contact list. It's not convenient at time. All in all the app is great. I still remember the time when you could comment directly on the status 😂. Keep up the good work. Oh yea, I don't know if it's possible but could you optimise it for those with lots of contacts status?"
I really love the app because of the new features installed on it. Buh I don't like the fact that we can't get screenshot of messages or photos that were set on a view once feature 😔😔
Lovely App. I will need to see who viewd my Catalogue. I will also need to be able to see all contacts that have Catalogues. I need to be able to know who viewed my whats app status. All the above are good for business for both the buyer and Retailer/ Wholesaler. I will also appreciate if whatsapp business can show clearly unsaved contacts and be prompted to save contacts like its done on the sister whatsapp. I need to be able to schedule sending to whats app business status.
"The app is excellent. Juats a suggestion, it would be great if the status could be editable even after sending. It would save a lot of trouble. Imagine if you shared a whatsapp status then realized it's not correct, make it possible to edit that particular status without having to delete it."
"I truly love WhatsApp business and all we are able to achieve on it.amd with it. The link to face and Instagram is excellent! The new ads feature, superb! Just like we are able to use WhatsApp business on multiple ""devices"", it would be great to be able to use it on multiple phones so that other staff/team members can respond to customers on the go from their phones. I have been seeking ways to achieve this for some time now. Thanks again for the awesomeness of the WhatsApp business app."
You might want to experiment on a feature that allows anyone to transfer their calls between their connected devices . For instance I am on call on my PC and want to set out I should be able to transfer it to my phone . I know it would be kinda of tricky to implement but it's worth considering ✅
"This app is great, the tools help with Business and customer service management. I however have a review for the team, wherever I changed devices I have to recreate my catalogue and business profile from scratch, kindly consider adding a profile and catalogue back up, it'll relieve a lot of device change stress. Great App!"
"This is the best app in business,makes easy,friendly and professional communication. In digital business,this app is reliable. It enables the business to be run in a cheap and affordable way. Above all,this is the best app in the course of interacting with clients as well as friends. If you are not using WhatsApp Business then you are missing the best tool in business!! Use it you wont regret!!"
"WhatsApp business is an app that's made my business easier. Keeping tabs of my work through the use of the catalogue feature is a big blessing on its own. But, the new feature of clearing all statuses once one is offline is making business quite slow because of less views."
"Thank you for all the work put into creating this app. The Catalog; I wish I could pin a specific product on top of the list or be able to sort the list, because My company makes food and nonfood but was first know for the nonfood and therefore want to keep my soaps on top (cosmetics and then the food products). Hope this helps to understand what I mean."
"The whatsapp business app is good nd very easy to use, i love the features it came with especially the quick reply options, bt i wish if my away message are only sent if my phone doesn't have network connection. Everything about this whatsapp business is good nd interesting...... Larry confectionery..."
"How about adding a notification/reminder button where one could easily snooze a customer or a client request. As a freelancer, sometimes I do receive messages from a lot of clients asking me to do a job for them. I often get tired of remembering everyone's request. With a simple reminder control, I could just add the client's messages or request to my reminder."
"I love this app. It so easy for my business. Lately I got pissed with it and I am still 😡. Why can't I make calls smoothly, it keeps breaking up. I don't get message notification, my clients don't see my status when I post them. Please is frustrating. This app is the only one we use as entrepreneures in Nigeria. Rectify the issue please."
"I love it. However, I just realized that the newly updated version has a recording button but it's really frustrating that we need to hold it till we're done with recording. Is there anyway you can help us make it be like the usual WhatsApp button recorder that we can leave the button while still recording? If there's, please help update it in the next version, thanks."
"""Your product has been approved"" notification has been going off since two days ago. Is there a bug or malfunction? Please make it stop. It's annoying. After deleting a message, please don't allow it to reflect, especially on the recipient's side. Take the message away that says ""this message has been deleted"". Just let it be gone with no trace. So the recipient doesn't know you've deleted a message."
"It's a nice app, good for my business but I'd appreciate more if you kindly add a translator button in chat screen so it can be easier for me to communicate with my clients who speak different languages from mine. Thank you"
"Dear WhatsApp Team, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a new feature for WhatsApp groups. As an admin, I would like to be able to hide all the group members' contact numbers from other members. Contact numbers are sensitive and private information, and I believe that this feature would help protect the privacy of my group members. I would appreciate it if you could consider adding this feature to WhatsApp as soon as possible. Thank you for your hard working....."
"A while ago, a feature was added which allows us to post status updates either from 'Recents' or 'Gallery' but it was taken out. I think restoring that will be a very good idea."
"The app is nice, the only issue I have with it is that one can view who has seen what is posted or who have not seen. On like the normal WhatsApp where you just clicked on info and you get to see who has actually viewed the message posted. I wish this could be add. Thanks a lot 🙏"
"I know the app is nice already, but you guys have made the worst update on the UI for tablets, the Landscape UI appears even when my tablet is on portrait. It's so horrible. On portrait, I'd want the chat screen to take the full screen, and not splitted with the list of chats, just like the way it was before, I'm using Nokia T20 Tablet."
It is good but I think the developers should consider adding the functions of editing the text in an already sent message.
"I don't y we can't view someone's status from their DM , please help us out it important.. *thanks for the improve ❤️* This one is new please ,13/10/2022 This review is for all what's app , please how can I send voice note on my status , I need to say something on my status but I don't want them to see my face , how can I do that pls , every day is not Christmas naw they don't have to see my face every time I want to share some information using my voice , pls let's work on that oooo.. thanks"
Ideal for any business communication. No fuss no hidden cost. Maximum communication effortlessly. Best business communication app for all languages worldwide connections. Tres Bien Pour Moi (very good for me in french) xxxx♡
I'm excited with the new feature that even make it trending more. I would like if they can improve with letting there be enabling of putting photo on the theme instead of dark and light theme... Thanks 😘😘😘. And to be able to report those that post malicious things on status instead of muting them.
"This app is awesome! Unlike any other apps in the Google playstore where no extra space is required for additional information. And too, unnecessary ad popping up and causing hindrance to the user."
"Whatsapp should provide a feature to make FOLDERS in whatsapp where one can separately keep the chats as groupwise category as one need, for example:- Now i wanna seperate some chats but i dont want them to be mixed in archive, so if i can make a folder, name it as i want and move those chats in that folder, that would be really helpful for me to filter and find my chats here quickly, consider once, thanks. And yes whatsapp should increase the number of chats to Pin on top of the Feed."
"This app is excellent for business peoples. But I have few suggestions to add in this app. 1.filter chats needed like unread, only groups etc., 2.speed because sometimes it functions slow 3.increse forward limits 4.backup space"
It's so beautiful design and near future endeavours it's a next Chatmessnger. Pls suggest me for better understanding of why my what's app usually crashing or not opening.Is there any update required for me get it corrected or at ur end it's a issues.Its troubleshooting. It would be great help if you can suggest me Via mail id As u know about
Love for watsapp However it is only app which runs even in no network 🤔 i.e when my daily data limit is exhausted. But please ensure some steps to make watsapp business more reliable like: 1: A seprate tab for groups and communities. 2:There should be a feed menu in which we can see for many services. 3: But I am giving it overall 5 star because app is going better day to day
WhatsApp Business has been the best and most easiest messenger app all over the world... I love and enjoy the special features for online business owners like us . But we would all love for WhatsApp business to have an inbuilt autoreply bot instead of using the services of third party apps that consume space on our phone as well as extra cost in using It would be great if this can be considered... Cos it will serve as a great help to run a business with a chat bot.
"The app is great and I love it with the new features,But why can't I send multiple documents at a time through the attach document option..Pls any help with this ?"
"Well I feel so excited for this try improving on more graphic.. I think it's having some slight issue with watching videos of statues 2 videos player at the same time, please work on that"
Please put option there to push quality the same not 17mb maximum...the setting say best quality but the quality drop when u send it...profile picture drop also heavy the quality....give us that option...if the video is 70mb let us send 70mb full quality...for people don't want that can put it off by setting...i no if u send it in DOC the video the size stay the same...but that u can't do on status so the quality drop
"I am happy WhatsApp heeded to complaint on split screen and reply by sliding. Split screen is now an option and can be changed in chat settings. Also, I can reply to previous chat by sliding on the chat. Kudos for this latest update Metaverse! I am giving 5 stars"
"Make whatsapp on Android phones reply to one photo by holding the picture and sliding right on grouped pictures, When a user recievs a lot of picture the photos are grouped together, in a case where the user wants to reply to one photo among the grouped photos, android does not allow the user to reply to one photo, the user is left with the option to forward the picture to the sender and reply with a caption. While IOS WhatsApp allows the user to slide the the right and reply to only one photo."
This is a good messaging and business conversation apk. I'm using it almost from 6 years. never get any bugs. Thanks
As it is very to slow to search any name or Messages as and can't send more then 5 member as if it is Business app then it should be more then 5 member as well it is not Showing broadcast List if wants to send any in same. Please update the same
It's a good app but can you add the feature where you can pin the status you would love to view... Like the way of pinning chats but with status.. do it when a pinned contact post a status we can easily see it
"Please enable ""Add Account"" option in WhatsApp so that in one application people can use multiple accounts is similar to Telegram which is more helpful..... Please consider my request..... It will help ful for all.,.. And business WhatsApp will be used strictly for only business purpose rather than personal purpose. Thank you."
The app is nice but in coming updates can you please add a 0.5x feature to the Voice note playback speed option. Some of us talk really fast and our recipients have problems hearing us. Thank you
"Very impressive for business owners like me. Allow to promote my products, to reply earlier when clients find me and am occupied, i used to set automatic message that client feel comfortable"
Quick in communication. Clear voice in voice notes and in WhatsApp calls. Good in guidance into other applications.
Everything is good but can we change themes..... green is so boring and what else we can do is to play only with dark and light mode.. please provide themes so it get interesting to use the app.. Thanks!
"Great app, absolutely love how handy the catalog is. However it was better with the row of price and having an option where you can move the items in the order you would like would be great. Having to edit things so that they are in a certain order gets tiresome."
The app is a good one. It makes it easy for me to display my business category However they are some categories of my business that hasn't been approved and it's taking longer than expected. I would also appreciate if the Ul can be upgraded in such a way that there's a UI for chats and a separate Ul for groups. The way it is currently make the messages congested and hard to differentiate.
I love it. But I hate how ads pop up up on my app whilst im busy with my chat even now i have to stop doing things im doing to stop ads can you help me out please i hate these ads
"Very Good and Useful app, they deserve whole lot of accolades on it! I would love to ask for a request like rolling out catalogue views feature 😊"
I like this app! It's actually excellent to be able to have both WhatsApp Company and also WhatsApp Carrier installed on the same phone and to be able to use them with different numbers. It makes it a lot simpler to manage both my personal and also service interactions without having to continuously switch tools. Highly advise!
"It is a very great app for businesses considering its marketing, customer interactions and handling, automation among others. I love it and I'm very impatiently waiting for future updates such as an option to reorder the catalog items so as to prioritize the main items to show as a preview when someone taps in the profile icon."
"This is something which any person or entity can use to assist in business. The app is clearly designed, well integrated taking into account of all type of mode of communication like audio, video, text, images, documents and if used properly, it truly hepls in growth of business. It is a tool which is essential in today's connected world."
"The app is great for business communication and I've enjoyed all updates so far. However, it'll be nice if you can add a schedule message feature so we can pre-send messages (compliments of the season or reminder) to our clients. This will really make life easier. 😪"
"If you're looking for an all-encompassing application to manage your service, you'll like WhatsApp Service. It has everything you require, from voice as well as video contacting us to invoicing and tracking expenditures. Plus, it's incredibly easy to use, so you can obtain your organization up and running in no time."
"Well, I must say. The features are really nice. I have a request though. Can the whatsApp STATUS have a voice note icon too, lol.Yunno, just like it has a pencil-like icon and a camera-like icon. So, I was thinking adding a voice note-like icon would be great! It'd be super cool. I'm still waiting for the voice note status icon to show up"
"My WhatsApp Business does not open, I have just updated the app but I can't have access to the app. When I press on the icon it will start loading and then close on it's own. It does not even open the WhatsApp Business screen. Thank you."
"The WhatsApp Business is really awesome and has a lot of business features that help to boost the business. However, there are some links that do not allow WhatsApp business to join. Please help work on it just the way normal WhatsApp is. Thank you for your great work. Ole James Onah"
WhatsApp business is truly amazing in the service it offers. I have a suggestion though. Can you add the feature of scheduling status updates? It would really be helpful for business who want to schedule their posts beforehand just as is done on Facebook
"This app great, i love it. But you should make in in way that we should be able to control which items or collections should appear on top of the list."
It is very useful app for any purpose business while do not bussiness and it has many good feature for all round l am very thankful for this app. Thank you so much for the features thank you so much creator l pray to the god who will be creator of the app who find success and success
It's a nice app since I started using I find no problem thku it can be nice if it's used to show deleted messages and deleted statues but anyway there are other apps that u can use for that but can't complain a nice whatapp with privacy if u want there is a fingerprint
"Add option to hide and lock chats and groups . Chats and groups should not be mixed up, there should be a seperate tab for chats. Great app ,needs some improvments."
Niiiiiiiiiiice !!!😍 Bt photo resolution in STORY should be increased.. otherwise the high quality photos get blurred!!!!
"It is a very cool app. But i badly need a feature . Whatsapp should have the status update setting by which we can update our products for not only 24 hours but also 6 hours, 12 hours . Please add this feature. A businessman badly need it"
Easy to use ads free . One of the main reason of using GB etc WA is they provide separate tap for groups. It's request or My suggestion is that all groups should be in separate tabs and group tap should have separate archives for groups. Thanks in advance ✨
"My experience with WhatsApp Business feom yesterday night that i installed new version is wreck and annoying,it keeps stopping or saying error. It takes time to upload a status and what's even more annoying is the fact that status uploaded by my contacts when i'm offline, i can't see them when i'm back online(good for me tho cus of those who didn't restrict me) Those who are not online when i updated my status can't see them. This is really annoying because i'm a business owner and my views"
"Good app ever, but i think u need to improve in terms of displaying and adding things like freeze last seen to mention but a few. But in general this is the best whatsapp app ever"
"This app is just great, send and review message, make voice class, make video calls, send and receive locations, do business, post and view status, no annoying ads and more. Great communication app✔✔👍👍"
I love it .however I just realized that the newly updating version has a recording button but it's really frustrating that we need to hold it till w........
WhatsApp Business is so good to me I like it and it's so easy to download it rather than the other WhatsApp. 👍🥰 I hope you will keep on experiencing this app so that next we download status posts from our friends status. Thanks for this app.
"Word of warning: if you're searching for a company app that in fact obtains points done, WhatsApp Service may not be the appropriate option for you. But if you're after a messaging app that's quick, enjoyable, and easy to use, WhatsApp Company is most definitely worth taking a look at."
Why does this particular site gives a lot of problem's and confused. Why can you mistakenly setting up incorrect update while you are controlling the device and fixed anything else you want. My advice to you connect everything autofill to stop the confusion.
"Love to use this and very excited however it will be better if you can add a nobody fitur for a WhatsApp call and video call therefore we can avoid a stranger person whom we.don't want to call/video call, thank you 👍"
I love this app because it's really good and works perfectly but the issues I'm having is that sometimes it always hanging and not responding pls try to work on it. Thanks 💖
"Love this app. Please add Amoled(dark and other colours) themes. Eagerly waiting. Dark green is good, but monotonous..."
Really good experience so far but with this update I can't send multiple document at once like pictures in document format not really cool
"It's very lovely,new features and easy to use. I would recommend you add chat locks for someone to be able to lock there private chats instead of locking the main WhatsApp app. Thanks"
"Just noticed after updated Whatsapp Business, when inserted a PHOTO, the alignment of S-Pen's pointer and actual drawing point on screen, was found incorrect. Previous version of Whatsapp does not have this behavior. Could you please check. Using: Galaxy S23 Ultra Android OS 13 One UI 5.1 Whatsapp version 2.23.6.76 Thanks 🙏"
"Don't know why have to update so frequently. May face issues like ""can't install on Android 10 sometimes"". Clean up and restart will fix issues. Thank You"
Its amazing but i will suggest one thing please add an option there on vedeo call where can remove our camera-screen: lay opon on the other person vedeo. It is really irritating.
"Good morning WhatsApp Business. I ,a user, suggest you to make some updates that add a function by which user can able to put a song for 30seconds in whatsapp status like photos and videos . This will very enjoyable for all . Thankful to you ."
"Excellent, fantastic and great. It's very helpful,reliable and an ease to physical communication. It has helped my practice as a Lawyer."
"WhatsApp is the best messaging app on the market, and what I like best about it is the WhatsApp Web, where I can exchange information from my computer to my phone much more quickly."" ""A great method for communication with the greater international community. Often prefer to use this."""
"The app has been really helpful so far but can the editting of whatsapp status post be included in the next update please? As a business person who is always updating her status with pictures of products, this will be quite helpful."
"Hello There, Good Day ! I am writing this message to add one more feature in WhatsApp Business and that is Screen sharing tool/option during video calls. Hope my suggestion will help WB to improve."

"Recently I can't send PDF FILE five people at once. Also from yesterday Cannot send multi photo in Document. When I'm try to select less than 30, it's only sent one photo in Document. My WhatsApp is updated. Pls solve the problem 🙏"
It is a very good app ever since I have been using it I have not encounter any great problem except that the voice message icon is not working well
"The only way to chat with friends, families,etc.never go by wassup business.the app is good for video recording and voice recording."
Hi! Add UPI now for Business accounts. You received a message but your version of What's app doesn't support it. Update WhatsApp. With You Invited ** to use payments. I hope you got my point.
Over all working is smooth but app should have a separate finger security settings bcz the app is working with the mobile finger security system there should b separate system of this app
This app keeps crashing/freezing and I have to uninstall and install it everytime this happens. It's a bad experience
"your interest is in general chat despite this App is for business that you supposed to concern, so we need you to add features that support business such as auto reply to specific word or sentence, also need you to add separate section for customers (not labels) I mean section contains our products or services and the customers for each product and how much he paid from total price, also allow us to change the currency because we're an international business."
"It's a nice app ,but the issue I have is that I might have an active data connection but the app will fail to notify me of new messages and it will also fail to give my away or greeting message unless I open the app."
"Good morning from Nigeria, oh I just want to make a suggestion, about the states update, in text from, I would suggest you add black to the status theme colors and positioning of the text format, maybe right & left Or something like that & maybe even the ability to move out text around and place them at any point on the screen, and also being able to increase and decrease text size. It Would make text status more fun Thank you. Plz also make it available for Android users I beg."
This app is really great and I've been using it for years now. But it seems the option to add the price is no longer available which now causes me to still have to give a price to the customer. I'm hoping that's brought back because stopping to calculate is time consuming.
"Multiple useful features: I have tried a few different apps to view videos of meetings and so far this one has been the best and my choice. It has very useful and easily accessible features such as controlling the speed, fast forward and rewind, jumping to any point of the video easily, etc."
"It actually plays videos, which is more than I can say for the default Chromebook app. I only had to click two permssions and a navigation instruction. I don't see a problem... All apps require permissions. This ain't Microsoft, and it ain't a secure platform. Welcome to the wired cloud age."
"This app has played every video I've thrown at it. I've gotten so used to the swipe/tap screen controls, I really miss them on my Surface. A/V sync is priceless. I don't even use most of the goodies this app has available. I paid for Premium, so I couldn't tell you about the ads in the free version."
"The Video Player all Format app by InShot LLC is a versatile and reliable media player that supports a wide range of video formats. The app is user-friendly and provides a smooth playback experience, with features like loop playback and playback speed control. One of the standout features of the app is its ability to play 4K videos smoothly. The app also provides a range of customization options, including subtitles and audio tracks. Overall, I highly recommend Video Player all Format by InShot"
"Most dependable! It's straight forward, no frills, no suspense, no nonsense. It's a Working Man's/Woman's application. The Offensive Lineman of apps. It shows up everyday, does what it's supposed to do near perfect every time, leaves it all on the field, never takes time off, and receives little or no fanfare. But shows up when called on and will do it all over again, time after time. Even with that red mass on his eyelid it never complains it's just happy when you're happy. Salute to you Mr App"
"10/10 plays videos. Which sounds like a low bar, but the video player my phone comes with will just fail to play certain videos for some reason, but I've never had that problem with this one. Frankly, it's really nice to have a video player that actually works. Plus, it has a bunch of nifty features like skip forward and skip back buttons, easily accessible audio control, and brightness adjustment."
"This app is the TRUTH!!! No other media player was recognizing my usb stick, and one that did - there was no ability to cast and it also didn't recognize all the files, just a very few. This player not only instantly recognized all of my files - but there is ability to Chromecast. This is EXACTLY what I was looking for - LOVE it!"
"Very intuitive. You can go to playing a video easily and it plays it without any hiccups. Absolutely the best player for video on Google Play. VLC is okay but it's better for music (at least on the phones) This is better than VLC. Easier to use and plays the files correctly. My only gripe with this is that it plays music but you can't play them artists or albums. You have to play them individually. Why this is a gripe because the music sounds excellent on this player. I was surprised how well it played audio. Huge drop the ball moment. If they can fix that, I would never need another media player ever"
"I haven't tried many other video editing apps. I guess that's because this app does everything I need. I have seen videos of the PC version which appears to have far more options and capabilities. On mobile I have cut, copied, merged, layered. I've never done more than 3 layers. Works great for me but there is a warning that too many layers on mobile device may affect performance. *Note, .AVI is NOT supported! I use a video converter to convert AVI to mp4 then I can edit"
"Previously had the MX player, but kept having problems with it and finally uninstalled it. I got this one, have been only delighted with it. I especially like being able to scroll forward or back to a specific point without adversely affecting the video. I had difficulty doing with the MX, that being one of the issues with that particular app. So far, this is outstanding ! I also still have the VLC player, but truly have no need to revert to it. And the scrolling function on this is far superior."
This is a solid app. The ads aren't too intrusive and it has a lot of playback options. I like it a lot but I have a couple things I would need improved before I would pay for ad removal. First sliding your finger along the screen skips ahead in the video and doesn't have a way to be turned off in the settings (as far as I can tell). It's very awkward. Secondly changing between landscape and pop up mode momentarily pauses the volume. Otherwise it's a great app for watching long videos
"This is by far the best video player I've found. It's the only one for Android devices that I've been able to find that plays all of the same video and audio formats as Windows Media Player does. While the free version does have ads, they don't pop up while you're watching a video (unless you pause the playback) and the ads aren't full screen unless you're backing out of the app. I only wish I had more than 2 thumbs, or I'd give this player 10 👍👍!"
"One of the best media players out there. I used to use VLC so I could watch a movie with Picture-In-Picture while I did other things on my phone, but it was always so finnicky. This media player has that functionality and it lets you change the size of the PnP. It also has a feature that allows the file to keep playing even if you've pressed the standby button on your phone. Really handy when you're watching music videos and just wanna listen to the music."
"The shear simplicity and user-friendliness of the app rates it a 5 for me. It is unobtrusive, It does what it does and does it well! It integrates well with the OS. Whenever the choice screen comes up with a selection of various apps to play the video I just tapped on, I select this one 90% of the time. it is definitely a keeper on my Android phone! I highly recommend it. BTW, this is the paid version I am using and well worth the price. Nice job devs. Great app."
"An absolutely perfect app for playing video files. It makes the stock video player seem laughable, by comparison... Like hilariously bad. You can watch the video file at all varying speeds down to the (.5). It has the 'pop-up play' feature with varying sizes. It also has the play in background feature. As well as a built in equalizer with an added reverb setting."
"Although I haven't familiarized myself with the more intricate details, such as, disabling the Volume and Brightness functions on the touchscreen, I do believe that XPlayer is going to produce more downloads/users than the VLC media player app, bar none. Very easy to navigate, and the Audio/Volume power pushes my setup, which consists of a 14"" Woofer and two Satellites, quite well. The only extremely negative thing that I really do not care for is the fact that Tik Tok advertising has infiltrated my playlists folders, and that's trash. 5/5"
"So far it's fantastic. Yes there are ads, but they disappear when you're playing the video. Someone stated that it does not support .AVI files, but yes it certainly does. At least on Android 10 it does. I've only just installed and watched a couple of short vids but I'm fully satisfied. Only took a min or two to figure out the tools. Everything I wanted was there. Speed, brightness, shape and size etc. I will update if I come across any glitches."
"I've been using XPlayer for several months. I have the Pro version, which costs peanuts for an app of this caliber. It has more features and options than the average user needs, but it also has a clean and intuitive interface, which I appreciate. I hate overworked things. Also, the app has performed flawlessly up to this point. Not an issue to speak of. So . . . excellent player + fantastic value = easy recommendation. Everything in life should be so simple."
This app performed very well. It automatically found all my MP4 videos I had downloaded & videos I had shot on my phone and I mp3 music files scattered across multiple directories of internal and SD card storage with no problem. It organized them and presented them for play. I like the interface it allows you to easily scan to a certain point in the music or video you're playing. It also allows you to skip ahead in 10 second intervals. Playlists are easy to make.
"Very smooth app. Transitions, edits, all of it is very smooth. I highly recommend using this app for saved videos, or movies. I had no lag, glitches, not a problem props to your coders for making such a fine app. The pop up ads also aren't as annoying, they don't always pop up in the middle of what ever it is you're doing. They'll pop up after you're done. I give you my best regards. Please do not let this app falter by any means."
"I was looking for an app to view the .mov files that my underwater camera takes. Previously I was converting them to .mp4 files - a tedious and time-consuming process. Now it is no longer necessary, and I am ecstatic! And I no longer have to keep both copies of the video (.mov and .mp4) in storage, which is a huge space saver!!"
"I love this app not only because it can play just about every file type, but also because it locates all the videos from whatever location you specify. It found videos I forgot about lol. The hands down best feature though, has to be the background play and picture in picture functions! I can do other things while a movie plays. Esp handy when the boss is coming because it still plays with the screen off so I can act like I'm listening to music! Love love love it!"
"Best video player hands down. Controls are easy to use, streaming from the net works great, being able to download subtitles from the app is super handy, everything about this is simply great. I have yet to find a flaw that bothers me. Had to come back and just add to the review because I found it has the ability to ""Cast"" and it is can cast file formats that another app I have (and paid for) can not cast."
"Dig dis,... I seldom give 5-star ratings but this video player is truly exceptional. Its the little nuances that enhance the experience like the 10-second skip-fwd/back option, background-play option, screen-zoom...etc. Also, the interface is straight-forward. I've been rockin it for a couple months now and have no complaints at all. Gwan 'n download dis joint STAT!"
"Two years ago, I was looking for the same app as VLC when it failed to work on my previous phone (well, back then my phone was just a mid-range phone). I found this app and downloaded it right away without looking at the reviews. This is one of the apps I am thankful that it was created. Very useful, and everything you would need for an AUDIO & VIDEO PLAYER is here. I wish we could also change the theme color of the app itself. Otherwise it's perfect and is doing an excellent job! Kudos!"
"Great app to play your HD videos. I particularly like the equalizer that enhances sounds and the +/- 10 second buttons during playback. I contacted and recommended to the developers showing the clock, battery life and remaining time of the video displayed on screen while the video is playing as a user option to enhance the product. The developers listened and have now included these features. I rank XPlayer as one of the best video player you can get."
"This is my favorite video app. Full customization, allows pop up videos, and it autoplays to the next video in the folder. I used this for my school lectures at 2x speed and love that it stays 2x speed when it starts the next video! It is absolutely perfect and I can not think of a single improvement. It even saves your last video and where you left off!"
"I have had nothing but good, borderline great experience with this company's line of apps. Easy to use, and excellent price. No 🐂 💩. Worth the $. I can't answer any of the optional questions as of yet. Haven't played around with every little thing of this app. I will though. But, so far, my experience is with this Video Player is turning out like my experiences with their other apps I have purchased."
"So far so good. It allows for screen mirroring. Multiple screen sizes. When u pause, your phone stays on and don't have to go back through your phone login, opening app, finding show to watch. referring to prime. U just grab your phone and push play. Don't know if it turns off over certain amount time. Sure it does. Haven't tried it out. But I luv it."
"Solid app! Does what it says on the box, and then some. The volume booster is pretty sweet. The brightness and the scrubbing feel pretty intuitive and the lock system is a nice touch. The interface is a little busy but I can get around that. The ads suck tho, I have to see if there's a pro version."
"Pleasantly surprised. I can't get much to work on this very basic tablet. Nothing works very well. Choppy and slow processes makes me wanna toss it in the ocean. But this video player gives me a real boost as it works smoothly with no noticable lag, no chop, no drag. Thanks to the developers. Thanks folks. I've only tried it offline with an Xvid rip of ancient aliens and it annoying as on the best Samsung wide screen. Thanks again for helping during these trying times, no thanks to covid."
"It's really good and I've tried a bunch (I'm embarrassed to say I watch a ton of content-which isn't easy considering the weight of a gigabyte) (sorry) // update 2/2019-and another thing cause I was vague, the sound is impressive. For example I was watching an amateur recorded video which had heinous distortion due to it being recorded with extremely loud ambient noise, as it was on the master I presumed that I was stuck with it save for some equalizer adj, but alas this xplayer cleaned it up!"
"I've gone through dozens of players and this is the only one I upgraded and bought. its superb for casting to all smart devices and just has made my video experience so much better. I've not come across any of the problems I've read in some reviews, I got rid of ads by purchasing it but free version was fine for long time."
"Perfect application. This is a lot better than MX player, have enough features easy to use it. Now a days some videos cannot be played in MX player but this app made it look simpl. One suggestion is that the option to increase and decrease the brightness option could have been simpler. I searched a lot to reduce the brightnes. In MX when swipe on the left side it's volume and right is for brightness, like that it could have been simpler. Hats off to the people who is behind this, well done."
I absolutely love this application. I upgraded and installed it on all my devices. I'm going to get a application emulator so I can use it for my computer too. If that's ok. But it's great. I would purchase it if I had to on everything. I love the lock feature and it plays wonderful. I lose no quality whatsoever. It only gets a little choppy when I zoom all the way in. But that's understandable. Keep up the great work. And thanks for the application. I changed my name sorry
"Great, sometimes if i add video, it wont find them. Like I cannot fit all of a tv series on my phone, so I watch a few episodes and replace with later episodes. Sometimes that makes me go thru file manager and play. Otherwise I love this player. I just bought ad free because I started getting like 30 second unskippable ads between videos. But I try other video player, this is the one I like most."
"Wow, super blown away by this app. It does everything I want it to do. Auto rotates even though i have that normally off, very clear lighting, and on my Pixel 2 there is no studder like other players. It plays all the media files I download, just great. I wish it would remember my night time preference instead of turning it off but that is a small complaint. I travel a lot and use it all the time during flights. $5 is pricey for an app but worth it when it works this well."
"Updated review: Wow, Thank you for responding and YES, IT WORKED! OK so yes, this earns 5 stars, perfect for vids, music & even movies :) Previous review: It's ok, but I'm looking for a video player app where I can turn my screen off and the sound will still play. I downloaded this one because it said background play but... nope, i don't see a backround play option."
Better than Google's video player by LEAGUES! The feature where you move 10 seconds forward or back is something the google player doesn't have but I desperately needed. The background feature is also amazing! I'm happy to have gotten this. The only issue I have with it is that reverb doesn't really work but that's barely anything and is probably user error. Keep it up!
"I've tried many media players and after a lot of frustrating learning curves and updates that made apps useless instead of improved, I (finally) just settled on XPlayer for my default video and audio player app. Every time I've selected it to play something, it's played, regardless of format, even the oldest formats I have stored on old HDDs from 20 or more years ago. I'm nervous about future updates rendering this app unstable or not working anymore like so many before it, but so far, so good."
"Seems to be flawless, has played every video format that I've come up with and the functions during playback are efficient and well thought out I especially like the lock screen function so that I can watch videos on the go without constantly worrying about accidentally changing the video. I rarely give five stars to but I think that this app deserves it."
"BEST VIDEO PLAYER EVER!!! I watch a ton of movies and shows but am often not able to get online. This player will let u make playlists, play in pop up window in 3 sizes. It even saves ur place if u stop watching suddenly. And the best is it plays background with no video so u can listen to ur music Videos while doing everything else. AWESOME JOB! Hint: if u like audiobooks from YouTube use background play and no more losing ur place when u stop."
"It's very rare to find a media player that rivals VLC, much less one that surpasses the legend itself. May be my new go-to for media playback applications. Although I am a bit more technically inclined than most, I can still really appreciate the simplicity and user friendliness of the various interfaces. 10/10 for me, for now."
"It's a good app, plays just about everything. 5 stars, although minor gripe with the Pop up Player. Why is there only 3 sizes, largest only filling 2/3 of it's allotted screen space, instead of letting me pinch and zoom to scale to screen edges? Also, PuP only displays in landscape mode so if video is recorded in portrait mode and you switch to PuP, it changes view window to landscape adding the black blocks to both sides of video. VLC has exact same issues"
"Best video player ever. Never had any problems with it. Allows me to turn brightness down while driving, volume boost only works on a couple of my phones like my pixel xl, music plays great in the background with screen on or off, has dark mode, and i could probably think of a couple other great features that i like about this app. I highly suggest that everyone get this app if the features sounds right for you."
This is an excellent app. you can watch movies play greatest of ease music special feature where you can lock certain videos so they don't get deleted accidentally. autoplay is great. It has clear user reviews. Not sure if it comes in different languages. But anybody with half a brain can use it. 😀
"I was experiencing a lot of glitches with VLC after awhile (background play not working properly, video restarting at random, audio sync issues, randomly disconnecting from Chromecast), so I decided to try something else. Haven't tried Chromecasting with XPlayer just yet, but playback is smooth on the phone and no issues with background play."
"Just what I was looking for. Has timed skips forward and backward (unlike VLC or Samsung's Video player), a really good display and function options. I've used it only once on my tablet, but so far so good. As far as ads go, they only pop up when you pause the video."
I've used a number of good to excellent video players but this one automatically scans all system folders and it does it effortly and so far as the video quality is this app is the best I've used yet. A crystal clear display with plenty of options in the menu. It gets 5 stars and it's because it works exactly how the product description. Great job guys... It's a winner on my my Note 8
"Great app, I've been carrying music downloads from phone to phone for since my Ipod. Finally this phone couldn't read the files. I tried 4 apps which could read them but gave me a huge pile of titles with no indices, that made searches nearly impossible. This one allows folders. Sorts be artist albums or songs, just like the old days! Good app"
"I like that it's a video player, video caster AND also a file manager. So everything I need to watch my shows or movies is right there in one app on XPlayer, instead of needing 2 or even 3 separate apps for each step. With XPlayer I can access my video files right from the file folders, press play and watch it on my device, or click the casting button up top during the video and have it cast to my TV instead. 3 in 1 definitely ain't bad. Thanks XPlayer!"
"App is awesome. Does slow motion, A-B repeat at any speed. Has clear zoom capabilities, volume and brightness controls, all of these are one hand operation if need be and the video quality is great. Perfect for downloaded videos and playback that's a hell of a lot better than your phones video player. Highly recommend, especially for porn! Lol! Enjoy!"
"Incredible image quality, intuitive and overall just works. Especially love the slow speed and zoom capabilities, I have used many, many different apps including Google photo's and VLC and i honestly get a better overall experience and results using Xplayer app. I saw option for paid version without ads( not overly intrusive amount at all) but at the time ignored it, now i can't seem to find access to paid version? Normally apps bug you constantly to go paid version, not Xplayer was just that 1"
"Good video player for Android with some nice features. I'm a long time user of VCL but switched because VCL doesn't natively play videos at the correct aspect ratio unless you manually change the aspect ratio in the settings and can't play Instagram videos at the correct aspect ratio no matter what. This video player works with Instagram videos, 1.33:1 videos, wide-screen videos and automatically plays them at the correct aspect ratio. Recommended."
"I'm impressed with this app. Right out of the box it's worked fine. One minor complaint,when I play the current video(top menu item, it just lists the current video in green with a green play arrow) when it goes to the next video it goes back up the order instead of the next new one."
"I always come back to this one no matter what other ones i try. Every phone that i get. Only thing that would make it the perfect app is if it would detect and play videos and audio from google photos and drive. Other than that, the controls are really simple and easy to use."
This is by far one of the best video playing systems I've ever used. It used to be add free but hey everybody has to make 💰 cause people got to eat. The adds aren't too overwhelming or intrusive that they ruin your viewing. They pop up when you pause or at the end of your movie so the app is very much worth it.
"I've tried quite a few video players over the years.... Most of them are basically the same and some might have a few attributes about it that are better than the others but pretty much they're all the same.... And I must say that I always use pay for apps..... This app right here he takes no prisoners.... Very solid all the way around... Gorgeous picture quality... Excellent controls... I might had most volume controls on these players don't really respond at all when you're raising or lowering but this one right here actually does which is a big plus for those of you who know what I'm talking about.... But in a nutshell comparatively speaking, this player is absolutely exceptional...."
"To be honest, the best video player on the play store. That's why I purchased the premium version of it. Only issue is that this app doesn't have more customize features and themes like other players and doesn't provide time to time update for more features. Note:- They latest update have a bug of vibration when we long press the screen to 2× the speed. It's very annoying."
Finally deciding to leave a review because I think it deserves it ^^ I've been using this app for 3-4 years now and it's been my primary for all my offline media files. My whole family uses it as well and is honestly what I think is the best media player to exist. The small in app purchase is also worth the price to remove ads and get everything. It's not that expensive and it's the gift that keeps on giving! I know it works for certain for Motorola/Android phones since I haven't had an issue.
"Great video player for devices, but the 'casting to TV' option is not reliable. It will cast for 10 - 15 minutes before it shuts down (and this happened every time I attempted to cast to my TV). Switched to PLAYit, and it is an excellent app for playing videos on devices AND for casting to TV."
"I upgraded my player to the premium version, unfortunately some days later, my phone got damaged, I bought a new phone and tried to restore the premium purchase in my new phone but it isn't working. Please fix this ASAP. Re: I followed your instructions and it worked. Thank you"
"best player and subtitles work great and has sync adjust. there's no jittering issues everything works like it's supposed to. This is on chromo OS where not all apps work nice, but this one is great."
"The app is almost perfect! It supports all video formats, never had a problem playing any video format like with other Android media players. It has important features like audio boosting, online subtitles, etc... One important tiny feature that is missing or I can't use directly is the remaining time, I want to be able to toggle between the current time and the remaining time when I press on the time, so please consider adding it in the next update."
"Great video player. The implementation of playlists is brilliantly simple and does not hog storage space. The ads, while necessary to support the app development, are unobtrusive and barely any hindrance to app use and enjoyment. It is also a good looking UI which I appreciate in an app. VLC on iOS should take note and learn from XVideo Player. Hey! Any possibility of an iOS port?"
No lag. Playback is smooth with subtitles in tow. More you want of course but how much will be enough. As long as you ensure that formats are always updated then you'll have no problems. The app is worth using. Thank you.
I'm an old premium user of Xplayer.... But after update to latest version 2.3.5 It started showing Ads..... It's unacceptable and I hope your team will fix it as early as possible. . . Thanks Edit : After the update version 2.3.5.1 my all previous Premium problems has been Fixed. Thanks 👍.
This is a very nice media player. I haven't found a bottleneck in the operation of this app. It just works. Everything that you need without the user interface feeling overcrowded or being complicated. I've only been using for 3 or 4 days so I'll post an update in the near future if needed. Get this one for sure. Highly recommended.
"Although it works fine, I have some suggestions to improve the experience: 1. Provide an option to create an account to sync the browser history, bookmarks, etc. 2. Provide free VPN connection inside the browser. 3. Increase the maximum tabs and provide an option to arrange tabs in folders. 4. Provide auto subtitles / translation for videos. 5. Provide an option to backup videos to cloud. I hope that you'll provide these features soon. Thanks for designing such an amazing app."
I like your player and recently buy your premium too but right now I am facing problem with audio playback when using USB drive to play videos.... It works fine with videos which are already in my phone internal memory but not for those who are in USB drive. This problem occurs with Bluetooth headphones only. Please fix this issue soon. I am unable hear character dialogues but only music is heard
"XPlayer is my preferred media player over VLC because it supports a wider range of video formats. Although I do wish it had a feature to remember the playback speed, I still find it to be an excellent media player overall. Its ability to handle various video formats with ease makes it a valuable addition to my media toolbox."
"So far this is the app. I've been looking for: Quick, simple and unconcerned with the type of file or genre of the videos. So much more efficient than other apps and I've tried them all, excellent product!"
The features of Wonderful. And the volume adjuster is also great I love this app. I will suggest it to anyone that would like to view their videos with this app because it is just great!
"It's very impressive, having infinity zoom mode.i love t absolutely non of app hv found like this. I wish you could add play video as Audio as well. I would rate t it multiple times if possible. Anyway thumbs up good work."
"Most favorite app for me does play everything I want, two settings for decoding options to play media obtained online, should get (linked) ""XFolder"" files app companion with password protect nice. Thanks XPlayer powerful media app...Very useful resource has not let me down. Happy!"
Worth paying for. Excellent app. I have made this my default audio and video player. It has excellent download video facility which js a time saver. Go for it. This is better than vlc.
"I have been using this play since 2020 and its the best for sure. Like I have watched all my tv shows, series, movies, etc. On this app and they looked phenomenal on all qualities. Simple to use and smooth app!"
"Great app, plays video files that some other players don't know about. Easy to use. However, one thing that is missing is the folder section in music. It only shows secondary folders, not the root folders. If the file management system was like in the VLC app, then it would be great."
"Good subtitle player than vlc or kmp player, but why do they want permission to manage all the files, they shud ask for only mkv, mp3, avi permissions not for all types of files like jpeg, XML, word etc. Then u can hav more confidence on the app. Intentions."
This needs to be made available on Android TV devices. They don't don't have anything that can compete to play mkv files from ftp servers. Also Chromecast won't work if youre streaming through a ftp server. Works perfectly with local files.
One of the best video players I've had so far. I appreciate the capability of being able to expand my screen and use the different slow motion effects among others. Good job.
Excellent media player. Does what it is described to do along with being one of the smoothest players I've used. Would to anyone with a need for a great tool.
"I thank you guys for your labour of love. This latest update that introduces new aspect ratios gladdens my heart. My 6.5"" device is 20:9. I no longer have to pan or stretch again. 😃 _________ You guys are awesome! You seem to know the users' 👥 mind. All the features are cool. Love them. But you guys can try to improve the theme a little. Maybe with multiple colors instead of single colours. The touch and hold fastfoward only increases 2x. Can we have it to 4x or 6x? Anyways, great app 👍🏼"
This is a dependable player with a nice set of controls via gestures. But the thing I like most is how it handles landscape vs portrait orientation. It doesn't flip when I don't want it to. Other players seem too 'helpful' in that regard.
"Best video player for android in terms of functionality and UI, however the player seems to stutter frequently (every few mins). Shouldn't happen on an S23 Ultra so no idea what causes it"
"Best app I've found to have every media file codec to play any type of audio file; it allows volume doubl it has a special lock drawer area to place videos that can require a seperate password, and requires a gesture just to even see if anything is hidden. (i.e. it actually moves location of said video to a password coded file inside the app) that makes it to where the file won't be displayed at all unless accessed by xplayer itself so noaccess on other video apps. 9.8/10"
"This is really helpful if you are into dual language movies. You can switch easily between languages, you can add or remove subtitles voluntarily, you can experience videos in different screen ratios. I was really lucky to find this early or I would have been engaged in dealing with websites and settings."
"Outstanding. It's easy to tailor your experience just the way you want it, videos look gorgeous and everything simply works."
"200% EXCELLENT APP!!!! THE APP ITSELF DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO 🥰🥰 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND VIDEO PLAYER... TO ALL WHO LIKE TO WATCH, LISTEN TO MUSIC,SONGS. A VERY FANTASTIC APP. ALWAYS ~LORI LEE SANTIAGO"
"A few minutes experience on this app, so far it is the best ever. unlike other apps the phone screen went off while the video is playing. thanks to the developer let's hope it will not change. And also the repeat option works very well, very few video apps which have repeat options."
Best for playing videos and audio. I love d app. But I want d developer to help me solve this issues. I mistakenly wanted to share video and I chosed (always instead of once.) Now I can't share my videos to any other platform
"So far the best music player I ever have, themes are the best features and the sounds it produces is great."
"Videos play in slow motion and sound is not synchronised, and half way through the video sound goes off and on and very crackly. Very poor. Update - Seems to work better with the Galaxy tab 7fe. No crackling and sound synchronised. On previous phone message said ""Cannot play, codec not supported """
"Using it for more than 6 months now. Easy to use. Has all the best features. Less/Short ads is the only reason I'm going for it. Great player, loved it."
This app is really 4k hd video show.display i like this app .not any side defected.any way video is simply look like and leastion mp3 music and our prived video be safe and so very musch .you codinetar.i so all video show .you prefect thingking .but one problems i think per years update new advance programmeble this x player function.bu so i am very satisfaction this app .no any riserch so like display exsicuit.thanks you so very mach .i hope my think problems just solve
I needed a video app that could play a very unusual format. Many of them could not. But this app does and it makes playing these OLD family videos so easy. Thank you!!
Add video-cutter that keeps the original quality without compressing. So as to be able to shave off unnecessary parts of videos saving storage but maintaining full quality.
"As long as I can use it to watch videos and add subtitle, everything is fine. Plusssss... Audio is good. Love it!!!"
Easy to use app. Minimal ads. Good equalizer function. Only down fall is screen casting sometimes fails to connect properly and viewing becomes difficult when trying to watch downloaded content shared through Google Chromecast. Overall a app worth having installed at all times.
"I used the non premium version of this app for almost a year before recently upgrading, and I'm happy to say that both versions are fantastic! The ads were unobtrusive, and the app features are easy to use and understand. Love it!"
"I have given it 5 as its always been a great app for all scores. Best app I've used, however I have a suggestion because of a feature that really bugs me. If you click any of the games the back buttons returns you to the homescreen, perfect. But if you click any of the categories at the bottom the back button closes the app. This drives me nuts, as it should always return you to the last place you were until that is the homescreen again and then should give you a warning if you want to close."
"This is the best scores app I have used, the live commentary is a great feature. Like others I have issues with freezing upon opening the app. I have also noticed that while browsing leagues/teams the app crashes if the app has been open in multi-tasking. It doesn't happen if you have opened the app when it's been closed. Still a million times better than other apps and no hesitations to give a 5* rating."
"Best score app around, has the most information with the best layout it's a no brainer. Have friends with other apps and without fail I get score notifications faster every time. Only small thing is that sometimes when opening it freezes on the loading screen, but opening multitasking for half a second and going back fixes it instantly. If they can solve this the app is near perfect!"
"THANK YOU FOR THIS APP! As a new user I have a suggestion and I hope you consider it. There should be a new tab that shows matches from the user's selected sports to be shown together without the need to switch between sports frequently. And as a formula 1 fan I want the ability to choose ""formula 1"" only for the motorsports the same way I'm able to choose PL from football.. Also F1 stats & data to be more comprehensive you may add the circuit layout to it."
"The best sports app out there to keep track of live results etc. Can't wait for a premium/paid option to drop on android to get rid of the annoying banner at the bottom tho. I hate the way it flashes, making me think something has happened in the corner of my eye when doing other stuff. Other than that, a superb app."
I really like this app because It has lots of football competitons to choose from. I think the problem is that there is a advert at the bottom of the page on the screen and it is destracting me. Can you make the writing much bigger for me so I can read them better
"Great app for scores, mainly use for football but other sports is a nice bonus. One feature I really like which my previous app didn't have is the player profile where you can see things like current club, transfer history etc. Some minor complaints would be no top level summary showing scorers, red cards etc like most other score platforms tend to have. Also, if the app has been in the background, coming back to it typically seems to be stuck loading, have to go back to home screen, reopen."
"Great app..kindly select up favorite default teams like Fotmob,,livescore apps,,,I mean add teams like Arsenal,,man utd,,Bayern, Real Madrid etc among other great teams...such that when o download the app..on the favorites. I don't start adding teams. They are there by default"
Without any doubt at all this has got to be the best app regarding the football I've ever had.. its so easy to use and absolutely 💯 on 🔥 never ever will I need to even consider using a different type of app 🙃 😅. I have always never had any issues until I was watching my favourite team CELTIC F.C. which is the team iv supported since I was 7 . This app is fantastic 👏 👌 🤣 😄 🙌
Simply the Best! I love this app and have used it for years now. The interface is so clean and easy to use. Adding teams and favourites is so easy to do and your favourite players entire career history and statistics are just a click away. Keep up the great work! 👏👏👏
"After installing several apps, I finally came to flashscore, And it's really awesome app. There's no log in required, you can watch any sports score easily without any ad interruption. I liked the user interface as well."
Easy to locate countries n teams. Would hope to have more info on NBA individual player and more categories of different age group league of soccer. Also noticed that recently the apps hanged as in not tally with the actual timing of the games.
"arguably the best app for keeping track of sporting events. You can find almost any sport or team you might be interested in, including statistics, additional information and recently even news. And there are updates and improvements regularly so perhaps it could become even better."
"I have been using this app for years. The range of sport covered is really impressive, as is the varied way in which it is displayed. I would be happy to pay a small fee to remove ads, especially the gambling ones which could be deemed irresponsible given that gambling can easily become an addiction. Overall a great app for following teams/players in a huge range of sports."
"Don't know if the issue is on my end, but more often than not, the app doesn't apply system theme settings when I switch from light to dark mode, it always stays in light mode. I've tried cleaning cache memory, resetting app and even reinstalling it, but haven't figured out the cause yet. Other than that it's a smooth experience."
"A superb app, it's almost perfect. 2 small improvements would be to show Goal Difference in the football league tables and also indicate when teams have been promoted/ relegated"
Nice application. Easy to use. Friendly for users. Recommended for betting people. Live updates are fast. Most of the games and the players details are available. So nothing to worry about any game details. Reminder operations and live details are very helpful for me. Such a nice application. Previous history of the games are very useful for prediction and no more applications like this. 1000% recommend for gamblers and sport applications users.
"Best sports app out there. But please add the ability to add a motorsports category i.e. MotoGP, Formula E, etc. to favourites. It's pretty cumbersome to add every race manually..."
I really find this app very nice and I recommend it to any individual who is out there looking for a place to get updates on matters sports. Very timely and accurate information. Keep up the good work @Flashscore.
"The app is top notch, the interface is superb and the goal alerts are on time. The only issue I have with it is that the time mode should be in 12hr not 24hr."
"Amazing app for results. I use it for tennis and football. I love the statistics, UI, commentary and how well everything is connected."
"Great app. I have been using this app for a year now and to be sincere, this is the best there is. The only missing feature for the football section is the countdown timer before the start of the match and half time"
the developer of this app is good. Crudo to you all and your brilliant works. You can even change your notification sound to your desire sound through settings. Bravo to you all. Nice app...
"A very handy App for all sporting needs ,can be slightly unresponsive at times but on the whole it's a very useful App ,I've been using this App for many years and would say its the better one compared to others I've used"
"Love this app. Use it all the time for tennis and football. The match summarys are great and really informative. It would be nice to still be able to access these after the match has gone 'in play', you can't at the moment as they disapear. Being able to read these if you've missed them e.g maybe called 'pre-match summary' (?) would definitely make this app even better (pretty please?!😊)."
"Need a scores app? Stop looking, as you've just found the best one in flashscore. I mostly stick to football but great sports converage all round. I've been at non premier league games where the score comes through before they've kicked off again. It's so fast and reliable, plus great preview and match report sections. Highly recommend it ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Always updated. Easy to use & we can find all sports all over the world Can you please also update the Lebanese premier league. Am willing to see the ,lineup,status,substitutions , what's happening in 1st 45time or 2nd same as other leagues. I know your always do the best for all leagues. Thanks in advance."
Match report is fantastic and live update is very entertaining. Thanks for the added and most needed information of added time. I love it.
Anyway it's a great app but your have to add a new feature For this tournament. like when you want to see the previous games each team has played home and away
Very reliable...very convenient... And efficient....what I find very handy is the pop up notifications especially when the app is running on background... Highly recommended
"It's really a useful app,gives relevant and accurate informations. The best among the rest,keep it up..... just love it."
The best live score app. Remarkably quick to update scores. Only slight improvement would be adding even more lower league clubs. Doesnt seem to update below the 7th tier. Still worth 5 stars.
"Why don't you come with a way. Whereby you have a search engine which we can search previous matches through odds i.e you key in, 2.91 3.00 2.10 and brings you all the played matches before. Thanks for the good work though."
"A very good sports app that covers a multitude of sports. It is the best one I have found that posts the the live scores (Football in the UK) almost instantly when a goal is scored i.e. if watching a match live on Sky Sports TV and a goal is scored, it apears on Flashscore within seconds, unlike the BBC sports website which can take up to 2 minuites to update."
Very up to date and reliable in terms of all your favourite sport news and all notifications.
"Thanks for the guidelines about the notification.My new suggestion is if you can please add the additional time in the summary of the event for the matches that don't have commentary or for both, because you only see the additional time in the commentary side.thank you"
"Great app for sports, not just footy ⚽. Massive amount of information available from sports all over the world. I mainly use it for footy though, and it's quick notifications on goals, information on teams, players etc in 2nd to none. Use to have about 3 different apps, but flash score is the only one I use now. Best by far"
"So good having instant access to so much sport in one place. And you can tailor the system to alert you to as many events as you want: match start, red card, end of set etc. All the stats in your pocket! An indispensable tool for the sports bettor or enthusiast"
"On of the most frequently used apps on my phone. Absolutely spot on. If I could improve something it would be the motorsport part, like the f1 standings when the race is live it's a bit confusing, other than that useful and easy to use."
"Fast notifications, waits for a goal to be confirmed nowadays rather than going all in. Showing the flashing text ""big chance"" usually means a goal has gone in but they're waiting to confirm it. obviously VAR can change that too but it notifies you of that too with its VAR symbol. Best live scores app. if you want obscure lower down leagues though, they don't always accommodate that, whereas other apps do (sofa score). but this is better."
"I love this app and have used it as my go to results service for years. Recently I changed from IPhone to Pixel and the app constantly crashes which is very frustrating, ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling again but still the same issue. Is this a known issue?"
"I use it exclusively for football (soccer). Brilliant UI when it comes to prematch info, live info ie. click on team for info and, individual players info like age, former clubs, appearances, goal assists, etc etc. Kinda easier than googling 🙂🤘"
"It is one the best live score app I have ever used because with live matches this app(platform) have all collection the data, record of every matches and teams which helps users for pre-analysing the game. It runs very smoothly. Thank you creator for this amazing app from my button heart❤️."
"It's a very good app of all time. It provides instant results and accurate histories and analysis of teams. All important records such as forms, injuries, H2H etc are offered in this app. It's fantastic."
"Best app to use, especially for those who are betting, everything is clear the odds, the countries, the leagues, the domestic cups... everything is simple and clear"
"Hello flashscore, errr… I was just thinking about you earlier on and you came back into my mind and I was checking some of your reports. Err, the one on the football when you’re all factual and your big stats are just lying there. I, I fell in love with your stats, you look really, really nice with your stats and eh, I’m hoping that things that things are going forward with us. I could come through to the app some night to catch up with you. Just to look into your app."
It's the best football goal scoring app whenever you select the matches to your favourite an a goal is going to score you are going to see big chance! beside the team that is scoring
"I've changed my mind about the app, it was good the previous one, but full of bugs and not so user friendly, but now the app is just perfect and wonderful, congrats guys the app is now fantastic."
Scores update nice and quick... Great way to focus on certain leagues and have a great history of results on an easy to use UI
This is just perfect. Every sport is concluded and very simple to use. The best sports app and I suggest you all to install this.
Best app ever for game review🔥🔥🔥....The only thing you need to improve on is to increase the speed of notifying about a match and to make one able to group matches of interest together...You should also provide live coverage of football games and live ratings of players 🙏🙏
An amazing app - covers so many sports and updated frequently. I love the live updates. My go to app for quick sports updates.
This is my favourite app when it comes to football results. Managed to get my mates onto it too. I can track everything with my team and tune into listening to games.
This app makes my life easy to check my teams. Coz it goes alphabetical. And I also can check the odds which will tell which teams can win. Briefly that's I about this app.
"Great app, whether old or new version I find Flashscore to be more effective and efficient, I use it especially in football... ready to welcome any newer version on this app.. good job."
It's by far the best live score app I've ever used.All details about upcoming matches are displayed accurately and it really helps me when betting.
Really first class app. I'm only a sports follower (as opposed to a fan) but this app gives me all the bang up-to-date news and data I want.
"Almost too much information available!! The alerts are excellent, it's great that they can be set by the user."
Really good app with loads of sports and options. If you don't care about cricket you can just remove the notification for it
Perfect app for any sports lover looking for quick and in depth scores for a bunch of sports.
"So far, flashscore is still my no 1 sport app, neat UI, faster nowadays, but it remains to ability to select more teams as favorite,ps work on this"
"Can you make sure you add more sports across the two Olympics e.g winter and summer. Also can you add more women's rugby union tournament e.g. Pacific four series, Oceania, Asia, Africa and Europian. Please."
"Lovely app! I never get to miss any of my favorite matches goal updates. Keep up the good work. I think there should be notifications for (Match Start, Match End, Halftime, Full-time, Penalty, etc) btw."
"I enjoy this app every day, this is a good one. It gives the right informations, I don't want to say it is exhaustive but you'll find all the necessary informations."
"It's the live 'as it stands' I love, manly football but it's just great, I leave it open and when away I track results even if watching another game, so good."
"Hello, it is the best app that I use. Thank you very much. If it is possible, can you add this option to the app? add player Score to the lineups Top Player rating Add full standing Add more stats (Like pass accuracy and such things)"
"It's have took a long time that I have been using this app, it is very fast that, it can show goal faster than u looking in the television.so may ask if there is any other app faster than this one , let me know.this is why I give them five star."
"Cool app. As a sportscaster, I find it helpful before and during my presentation. Please include goal difference in league standings"
"This football live scores App is very good and detailed, much more better than other ones I had before. Less adverts other disturbing rubish things in some cases. This is why I gave 5 *****"
Flashscore is really exciting interms of fetching live scores rather than besoccer and other familiar apps to be honest. It fetches scores faster than the DSTV itself and really appreciate the developer for this. Glad to have your app for real.🤗🤗
"Covers nearly all sports with up to date info. Follow your favourite clubs, some stats, news etc. Excellent."
Very useful app. Highly recommended Though it would be nice if notifications for unwanted sports weren't pre-selected and one has to deselect one by one
flash score covers all if not the most of the leagues. It doesn't seperates or give much time only on the biggest leagues only Nah every league is equal to every nation.Thank you so much 🥰
"I love it, I believe going forward you should also add a feature where the app tell us live of dangerous attack, thrown ins free kicks as they happen in that moment."
The best scores app out there with much more information about teams and players too. Easy to use and never any problems.
"I Will give you 5star because you deserve it on top I will like to add a suggestion, the app will be more useful to some of us gamblers who uses your app to analyze the games if the app have its own prediction or if it shows percentage or ability of a certain team to win or possible outcomes.... Please consider my suggestion."
"The App is great, fast to load and easy to maneuver. I hope it keeps getting better when it's time for upgrade. Good work."
It blows my mind to think how possible with many users yet the app doesn't hang... When I got it I just had to delete all other football analysis apss
"Even if I change a phone I always install flash score, it is super interms of performance and is also fast to give updates on how it stands, if the game is on"
Superb app. This is the best app to keep up to date with all your favorite sports and all your favorite sporting teams around the world.
It's amazing. Thanking the developer for his professional ability to realize we enjoy good sporting news details. You guys are the best
I like this app. Flashscore gives the best match fixtures with the odds for betting I like it so much . I do recommend it.
Great app interm of interface and greater information available for all matches with stats and odds showing on all outcomes of every event.
This lot are really 'on the ball'. Yet to find a better app anywhere in 5 years. Works worldwide. And instant notifications more or lesd.
"It's everything you need to know what you want in any sport you want. Just 1 very small complaint and that is, when I've got the commentary on listening to football. There's a little bit of a delay and you'll see the score change about 2mins before the commentary but that's the only thing I wish was better. If I could give 4 and a half stars I would but it's too good just for 4 stars. ALL in all its a very good app and I wouldn't swap to something else unless it was a lot better, which I doubt"
"It's convenient, reliable and faster. A good app for all your sporting news 🗞️."
"I've downloaded and tried numerous live score apps and this is the one I settled on. Its easy and simple to use, updates within seconds of a goal being scored, red cards etc, my only issue is there doesn't seem to be a way of paying to get rid of ads."
"Re..((I'm giving 3 because you ignored my comment. Bring back the double window feature and the previous ""Big Chance"" display.)) Big change display fixed. I've even forgotten about the double window feature as I'm really enjoying your updates. Thanks flashscore. I can bet that a premium version of flashscore will be highly patronized."
"Not opening on Samsung anymore, all I get is the flash score opening screen. Had to download a different score app much to my frustration as this used to be the best on the market. It still works on IPhone but not my galaxy. Back to 5☆☆☆☆☆ review, un installed app then reinstalled and restarted phone, all good now, thank you."
"This is the best sports app for live and historical scores. Easy to set up and use with particular emphasis given to any teams you like across a multitude of sports, once added to your 'favourites'. Saturdays wouldn't be the same without this app ⚽️⚽️⚽️"
"Honestly I love this app. The main thing I like is the reports- first of all, they are published very quickly after the match, and second- they provide a good explanation of the match. Isn't enough? No problem! You have a play-by-play live commentry. However, I would like to offer the extention of the live audio commentary. I tried it and it's amazing, but it really should cover the 5 big leagues of Europe. Generally, this app is probably the best in this market, and I recommend it."
"Best sports up I've ever used, hands down! If you're into sports and you install Flashscore on your phone, I can see no reason why you should ever, ever uninstall it or replace it with a different one. Let me say it again. Best sports app!"
This app is completely awesome but needs to improve in the area of getting match statistics and lineups for every match they feature.
"The best app in my phone not even kidding. Use it several times every day. If you are a professional sportbetting gambler, this app is a must."
It's perfect beyond other sports apps simply use it and it give notifications during games plus voice commentator live u killed it and I like it really
All in one app. When looking for something I don't have to go back and forth. It doesn't freeze out of nowhere like the one I've just deleted.
It's reliable and faster in giving the score and it gives all the transfer information of a player.
"The app is good, but I need a section that can provide notification when a certain team score and halftime and full-time resurt..."
"It is somehow great when it comes to football updates,,,I like it very much,,,since I learn more interesting things I like about football"
"Accurate, easy and fast. The best sports score app on the market."
"IT professional with decades of heavy Outlook on Windows use. Outlook on Android is not a desktop clone, e.g. it relies on native Android app for contacts. On Android, Outlook is its own animal. But it's flat out the best there is. Check out the extensive feature list in the Play Store. That's not a mere wish list. It all works rock solid. I use it to manage my personal and professional life while on the go. Don't leave home without it. (last edited 03/17/2023)."
"Outlook is a very user-friendly app that is great for business and personal use. It's a lot like the Google email, except with a different format. I personally use this for my UVU schooling. If you want an app that runs smoothly and doesn't always crash, something that can be organized with filters, and also works well with Microsoft office, Google outlook is for you!"
"I've been using or teaching outlook since before it was outlook. I wouldn't use anything else. I have noticed, though, that the more recent developers don't quite have an good understanding of the foundation on which it was created so the of the newer changes are a bit awkward and or annoying."
"Update 3-13-23: Still a very capable & useful app! Original post; Very good app for multi email management. Has been running smooth for few months. I don't know if such feature exists and I just haven't found it, but it would be very helpful to me to convert over email messages to text without having to navigate to Android (v12) features. Keep up excellent work!"
"Since I don't like going on line to read email, I like this app. It's a secure manner to read email without trying to logon, put in password, etc. I like the simplicity. The calender and contacts automatically populate to all apps on any computer, tablet or phone that I use for email. I highly recommend this app. The only problem now is that it is harder to set up an email account."
"Update as of April 5, 2023: This is still a great app for me to use! Please continue to read my original review which I had posted in 2021: Great mobile app. I never have any issues with the app and it syncs wonderfully with my Microsoft account on all my devices. The ads don't get in the way (such as now, when I am typing), as they are at the the bottom of my screen."
"It was excellent for a long time but now it crashes. I cannot read my emails. I Uninstalled it and reinstalled it, which helped for a few days but now it crashes again as soon as I open it to read my email. Anybody else...? Update: It works fine now, no problems! It was an issue with my phone settings"
"I switch to outlook email from gmail a few years back because it was cleaner & much simpler in visual & use. Outlook didnt have the writing tools we now see (font, paragraph tool, etc) so that was a drawback. A few years later they have those tools & more. On top of that they remain simple, professional, & consistent. Their other products intergrate well with email which enhances the experience. Team outlook! 💪"
"I absolutely love outlook. It's the best email app out there. It's so user friendly and has so many wonderful features. I love Outlook, it's the best email program out there. What can I say, I just love it. Please bring out more features, I can't wait to see what you'll do next, please add like more clearer imojis and let it be a little easier to manage and edit when adding PNG or jpeg images."
"It's MS Outlook, need I say more? It's the big dog on the block. It's very comprehensive. It used to have a feature with which you could select a sender and filter just the emails from that sender. I miss that. I also don't like that I can't erase or trash ALL the emails Fram a sender at once. Trashing 100 or 200, whatever it is, at one time over and over and over again is a real time suck. I would appreciate it if I could really trash ALL at one time. JE"
"It's an email client designed to primarily work with Exchange or Exchange Online services. It does exactly what it says on the tin, so it gets top marks for that. Otherwise, it bugs you to rate it (which prompted this review) and there is the ever impending doom of ads in the app. When Microsoft adds them, it'll be dark days indeed, and my rating will drop to zero stars."
"I have been a customer with Outlook for a long time. I love the ease of navigation with most of it's applications. However, not really understanding the ""new"" connection with sharing, especially emails from YouTube. Are they now exclusively the only way to email videos? I hope not, because it poses a headache if most of your contacts are through Gmail; it doesn't seem like you have a choice, and l only have a few contacts on Outlook, and no, l do not want to link them. So what can l do?"
"A world of efficiency without hassles. Reliable, customizable, easy to use options! Yes, there are adds (demographics for me are all wrong), but I never waste my time with endless security issues -- unlike another well-known email/search engine! Thanks for makimg the user experience such a joy and seamless across all other MS products! You are the best!"
"4.8 Stars My opinion is that this is the best Email app in the play store. Yahoo came in a close 2nd. Blows Gmail out of the water (never did like the Gmail app). The interface of outlook is very user friendly. Outlook is customizable. You can link any email address you have quick and easy. If you are stuck using Gmail and want a change, or just want a better, simpler application download Microsoft Outlook. It will be worth your while. I guarantee it."
"It's Outlook on mobile, does what you'd expect. I used it years ago, hated it, switched to Nine (or touchdown? Idk) but a year or two ago switched back, been surprisingly happy with it. Only issue is some occasional keyboard/copy/paste glitchiness (using Galaxy s22 ultra), but I've typed up long emails with multi-level outlines/bullets etc with minimal hassle, integrates with Teams, does what I need."
Super easy and quick. I've used the outlook app in the past and it seemed clunky and incomplete so I deleted it and used the native email app on my phone at the time. I recently tried outlook again and I am super happy with the overall performance. Huge improvement over past attempts. Great job!
"Yes. I use the free one and know it's free because it has ads. Yes. I hate ads, but they are not intrusive and I don't want to pay full retail price or the ridiculous leasing option for a powerful app that I never use to it's full potential. As an aside: I don't like this leasing idea where you never get to own anything. Look at what some automakers are trying to do."
"This app makes it very easy and convenient to look at the various Hotmail, MSN, or Outlook emails in one location. Selecting multiple emails to delete, flag, move, etc. is much faster than other apps where each email selected requires a long hold to select it. And the Home option of looking at all emails makes it very easy to quickly delete all of your junk and deleted mail for all accounts at once."
"Easy to navigate and sort by search any mail you receive. Much more that I'm still learning, a whole different experience as to a regular email. It's very easy to navigate and sync to Google drive A really great experience, blue is my favorite color in which all Outlook apps are blue unless you download your own specific color or change your icon the best safest mail that I know. And it's made and created by Microsoft which is a very promising feature just the name Microsoft makes it the best."
"This app has been a great asset. It has all the features I want in a mobile email client, multiple accounts, html signatures and more, that you do not find with others. It also works perfectly with my dual screen Microsoft Surface Duo, utilizing both screens. A dependable and professional product."
"I don't have an outlook email, but I'm using this as an email client for Gmail, Yahoo, and another email service. It's much better than the Gmail app and has many more features. Much more reliable too. I was hesitant of switching to it because it's Microsoft, but I figured Google is no better. So if you want a more reliable email client with good features and interface, this is highly recommended."
Used to be a strictly Google email Guy. However Outlook far surpasses my expectations and even those benefits that I get from the other guys. Outlook has an easy-to-use set up and in my opinion is much more efficient. I always receive my emails much quicker on this platform than any of others.
"I've always used this email and it's so easy to use. The only suggestion I have is that it'd be great to add a feature that lets you change the outlook widget theme or colors, I have a dark background and when I see the widget it just feels so gross to look at for how contrasted it is from my theme and background, but otherwise the widget is even cooler than I expected, you can even add multiple accounts so it'll show all of the emails you get from every account."
"I use 3 versions of Outlook: 365, the free desktop app in Windows, and this mobile app. So easy to manage emails, calendars, contacts, and the app plus free desktop version sync folders and settings so well, it just works. Yes you see 1 ad for the free version, you can just swipe it away, or upgrade. The app has had many updates since launch, many improvements."
"It's the staple. It works. It has great organization & functionality. I believe it can be integrated with your calendar or other Microsoft apps. for what's supposed to be an optimal exp. & preferred ease-of-access for the user. I personally have used it for years & the worst thing that's ever happened is forgetting I made a specific folder for some less than important e-mails, I missed an important message because I forgot to check that folder instead of my inbox. Beside user errors, it's great."
"I have been using Microsoft Outlook for more than 20 years. It evolves tremendously, making life easier. The ease of use with proper and intuitive labelling, accessibility, and graphics handling are all top notch. Above all, in its latest iteration, the API connection to various e-mail server and clients are the best."
"I love using Outlook for my personal and work email. It has many cool features that make my life easier, such as: Focused inbox that filters out the less important emails and shows me what’s really important. Smart search: that brings up what I’m looking for before I even type a word. Outlook is the best email and calendar app for me. It’s fast, reliable, and secure. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a powerful and productive email app.👍"
"Excellent app! Have 2 Outlook email addresses, and this app works as well on my phone as does the software on my laptop. Can't beat that for functionality! Update #3: Still running well on my Android phone. 🙂 Update #4: This app is still handling my email needs really well. I'm particularly pleased with how well it sorts out the spam and junk email into a separate folder. Makes checking/deleting it lots easier. 🙂 Update #5: Still happy with the sodtware! All's well that ends well. 😉"
Very professional and can access important work documents from anywhere using my mobile phone too. works seamlessly with MS Teams and can hold office meetings across time zones and continents. Business travel might fade away sooner than we expected. Great work! Like the way work files are stored in one drive. It is so easy to access them. Wonder what happens if one drive is hacked!
"Works flawlessly Only small gripes are every message I create comes with the signature, ""Sent from my T-Mobile 5G Device Get Outlook for Android"". And, sometimes messages don't send (eg large attachments and weak connection). It needs a better way to inform the user to try again, and to automatically refresh and send"
"I get a lot of my best emails on this site due to the environment. And the search and results brecom is not to frogley on my personal/upstreal, and miscellaneous data and info especially that of which is/has been deleted. The pending times are remarkable due to the low universal impact when they are perfect. Thus being a perfect outlook experience personalized or not. Thank you all. Don't stray from the ideal practice and take the 389 bid due to degrading and falter $^* THATS ON ME BABEIGHY*^$"
"Love this app. Easy to get all of my information in one place. Email, calendar etc.. it would be nice if you could change the colors of some of the calendar events. Other than that still a great app and tool to keep up-to-date with my daily events."
"Very happy and easy to find a way around. Only issue is storage problem my husband had, even with plenty of storage he has keep getting out of storage message and stopped receiving emails couldn't send any email ...he had to buy extra storage for the email account he only uses for personal use only not for business..so it was bit disappointing."
"It's becoming my preferred email and calendar app. One thing I like about Google Calendar that this doesn't have, is the multiple alerts for an appointment. I sometimes like to give myself a day early notification and then an hour before the event. Otherwise, I'm enjoying the app I use for work and personal use."
"Mostly intuitive. Some functions like calendar are at a second level. Works well with other MS products. Let's you check sender details if in contact list, or if not it provides some details to check for scams and phishing emails and so on. Can sync across devices so can keep everything updated e.g. three people on their own devices. Getting contacts on mobile to amend or add etc is not straightforward. But I've used it for over 25 years so shows that for me, it's a go to product. I use an ad bl"
Outlook feels very neat and organized. I'm not trying to compare it to Gmail but somehow I don't feel as overwhelmed visiting my outlook account despite me having more contacts there. 😅 The tool that reminds you of dates and emails to catch up on is probably my favorite feature of the app. Definitely a 5 stars. 🌟
Robust email system. Have been using this in business since it first came out in the late 90's. Best feature is the direct embedding of snip-its. Wish they would bring back the grade/education level filter. I had fun with this lower my verbiage to 7th grade levels so some recipients could grasp the meaning of the sentences.
Everything seems easy enough to use on the app for emails and the calendar. It's convenient that the calendar syncs to the desktop. The app doesn't seem to have the issues I experience on the desktop version.
"It's very nice, I've enjoyed my experience so far. It's by far the best mail app i've used. However, if there's anything i'd like to be added is a white theme where the upper blue bar isn't there like with dark mode but in light mode"
"Outlook has been a great program for over 20 years, and has adapted with new technology. My only drawback is that I'd love to be able to search for a keyword, and be able to delete as many of those emails as I'd like, without having to open each one to delete. Thx!"
"I have been using Microsoft Outlook for the past 3 decades and have found it to be useful. Of all the other email apps, Outlook is more user-friendly and easy to manage (especially for my different files). Thank you 😊"
"It works well across 2 android and 2 Windows platforms, syncing and storing without error. Of course, one can suggest minor changes and improvements but overall it is excellent, reliable and comprehensive."
"Always worked, it's a shame that my pinned don't carry from desktop and it would be great if they did, it's really annoying when you've pinned some emails for when you're travelling or something! I know there's folders but a pinned would just be quicker"
"Outlook is the best app for a business man or a student could ever have. I recommend every individual to download it since it can do anything, write emails, share them and recieve them. App itselfcan scan spam emails and you can block them. It's a must have app if you're a student or business man."
Outlook works so much better than the onboard mail/ calendar application on Android and iPhone. Being able to connect shared mailboxes is a game changer. It really does work like outlook on a computer.
This app really stood out to me in every aspect possible. The mere fact it already sets all the deadlines and events recieved in mail form to your calendar is just amazing. The whole experience is so amazing.
It is improving. My skills have improved. I use this app for work. The signature features have improved on mobile. I made a great mobile signature with a picture. I want more control of font when I type an email.
"Outlook is outlook. If you have multiple email accounts and calenders to manage, this is ideal. Using it professionally or as a personal email app to manage multiple email accounts, it works great! Tasks are also a great feature for grocery or to-do lists that can be shared with others like the wife."
"3.17.23 update - still running well after all these years but I do wish their spam filter was a bit more fine. Lots of obvious junk gets through. The addition of advertising banners has been a bit annoying but I made a point a long time ago to never ever ever purchase an item I see in such an ad so it really just makes my life easier. Keep up the hard work all, thank you! fulfills all my mobile email needs. theres not a thousand notifications and runs flawlessly!"
This is so much easier than other email apps. Being able to go from my mobile phone to my PC and back again with the same emails is great. Also being able to report phishing and inappropriate spam is super easy.
"Excellent email layout. I like the idea of having focused and other mail separated as it doesn't seem so overwhelming when you get bombarded with too many emails. I also like you can report phishing. Also on the phone there is only one ad, and it's small and unintrusive."
I have been using Outlook for my mail account for many years. It is very straight forward to use. I have been able to move and organise my mail as I like to. The overall experience of my Outlook leaves me giving 5*. I am very happy with my choice to use this service/app. It has quickly become my favourite organiser. I use the calender to remind me of my appointments all of the time. Very well thought out and totally suits my life/needs. Thank you. Have a great life.
"The new Cortana feature is amazing... Firstly, it reads outloud the new email then gives you options on how to go about it. For me the most fascinating part is when it translates your speech to text. Then sending the reply. Of course with all the safety precautions put in place, don't use your phone while driving!"
"After learning the system, it seems to be relatively easy for me to understand. To be honest, I've always favored the AOL desktop email version. But 365 is so much more than just email and Outlook much more than a filing cabinet. You can do more"
"They improved it recently, a clicked-on web link will open in an Edge browser window now so I don't have to close the link to view my email again. The Edge browser seems fairly new but suffices, I like Chrome better for the browser but I like Outlook better for email. It is a handy email app overall and I like that it separates focused emails from other emails, thanks."
"Outlook is the only mail app I need anymore. To Do List, Calendar, and Contacts are included. Integration with Zoom makes signing-in to meetings a single click. Quick to setup Gmail and personal domain email accounts. Seamless sych with Microsoft 365. MS alias accounts are automatically setup for use in Outlook. The android version is still much quicker than my Windows 11 PC."
It's very user friendly I can already see most message lines while in the notification bar and also you can most lines on the app. Sometimes I don't need to open the email just to see who is sending me an email.
"Outlook is hands down the best email app I've used on my Android phone. It's fast, reliable, and packed with features that make managing my inbox a breeze. The interface is sleek and modern, and the app integrates seamlessly with my calendar, contacts, and other Microsoft services. I love how easy it is to switch between multiple email accounts, and the ability to swipe to delete or archive emails is a real time-saver. The app also offers great customization options, allowing me to choose"
Very easy to use and very functional. Serves all my email needs and is integrated into the Windows environment so it has cross functional capabilities compatible with other Windows applications.
"It has quickly become my default email client. I can view all my mailboxes and all my calendars in the same place. Works without a hitch for the most part. It does however sign me out of my work accounts every few weeks, but that's not too much of a hassle. Just wish the desktop app had some of the features offered on android."
"EXCEPTIONAL. Always used & loved PC-based Outlook. When Microsoft purchased an IOS/Android vendor's email client & called it Outlook about 6-years ago, it was a major disappointment. They've finally righted the ship. Today, Android Outlook is a feature rich client that gives Gmail a run for it's money. You won't be disappointed. 😎"
"Love MS outlook😀, it's ....just EASY! More intuitive and much easier to use than other mail providers. So much more functionality when composing mails, easy to organise"
"Well as promised I have been browsing the app and it's real easy to navigate & take care of things that I wasn't able to on the mail app on my PC, Being able to check Email on the go is what I needed, Like being asked for information or a code that I was sent through Mail while I'm out running errands, I been with Outlook or Hotmail since the beginning, The rest of the email boxes like Gmail & Yahoo have a setup that is filled with ads & news that just gets overwhelming & Outlook just doesn't."
"Thank you, Outlook, for creating these email accounts. I have always used Outlook, and I have never had any problems using their email accounts. I find that having 2 email accounts helps manage streams and other areas of life by splitting the usage between two accounts."
"It's simply the best email there is. It's extremely powerful - all of the tools you could want or need are right there, intuitively at your fingertips, just like with all Microsoft products. If you're looking for professional email, look no further."
"Best email app I have ever used. Works on all my devices, never any problems, always there when I need it. Microsoft may be the evil empire, but their products are bulletproof, and communication is the keystone to any successful endeavor."
"It's really good, useful and practical. I would like it to have ""Blocking"" options when blocking emails, such as * Block domain, * Block sender, You keep receiving emails from other senders on the same domain, after you've blocked one. Thanks a bunch!"
"A solid, reliable App. I use it with the Microsoft business email system. The app has never crashed or misbehaved and contains all the features I expect."
"Best app to keep track of, and make accountable, all tasks, Vendors, and activities. Easy to learn and use. Very communicative throughout all platforms, too."
"Once you would have learnt all the available organisational features, Outlook is excellent for managing a large number of emails on multiple projects. It also links well within Microsoft 360, in particular, the tasks with TO DO LIST."
I'm very happy with this app. For unknown reasons my Gmail app was not collecting my received emails so fast as on my previous phone but with this Outlook app it's even faster to receive any email including from Yahoo mail. Very satisfied. Same after more than 1 year. Same after 2 years
"This is app is an all in one kind of app. It has a calendar built in, it orginizes your emails for you, and you can add multiple emails to appear in the same inbox! I absolutely love this app and would reccomend it to anyone."
"Helps me stay organized, perhaps an understatement.I have used Outlook/ Office for years. Taught college students how to use it along with other Office apps in ""Integrating Technology into the Curriculum,"" a Master's level course for Educators. I love having it integrated on all my devices."
"Layout is good and simple. Loads fast. So far, the app has been reliable although moving attached pictures are somewhat still troublesome, making using other mail services easier."
"Edit: Love the improvements. They seem to have sorted the signatures a bit more. Nice one Microsoft. Very well built app, functions smoothly once you get the hang of the layout."
Best mailing and calendar app I know of and I have tried a lot over the years. Yes there is privacy concerns and also some anticompetitive tactics but the truth is it works well.
"Decent reliable emailer. Does the widget use system default for theme, dark or light mode? Any chance of adjusting the the opaqueness of the widget to show some visibility of my background i dont really need to fully see a bold white and blue background on the widget."
"I have used other apps to access my Live Acct. I find it much easier to sort & add folders. I have been getting a lot of phishing & spam emails feeling my Acct has been compromised. I feel more secure working with the native app, developed by Microsoft, for security & peace of mind. 👍"
"Easy to use and find important emails amongst many. I have been using Outlook for close to 10 years and would never use a different email provider (other than Google, as it is required for many Android functions."
"Has worked flawlessly for the 2 years I've had this phone. Unlike Gmail which only seems to work for a few weeks before the notifications stop, requiring me to disable/re-enable the app or clear the cache to get them working again. EDIT: 18 months later, Outlook still works fine while Gmail now only works for a few days before crapping out."
"Microsoft Outlook for Android is a fantastic app for anyone looking for a robust and feature-rich email client. The app is well-designed and intuitive to use, making it a top choice for professionals and casual users alike. One of the standout features of the app is its ability to sync seamlessly with your other Microsoft accounts, such as OneDrive and Office 365. This integration allows you to easily acces"
"Works very well. Sync sporadic behavior resolved (maybe when moving to a new phone mid-2022). In the past, did not always sync in the background and I sometimes needed to open it to sync. Does not have tasks and contacts as part of it which forces me to use other apps for that"
I've been using outlook since 2011 and this app is great I can check my mails anytime I want and its very easy-to-use. Update 2023 : I'm still using this great app. It's still easy to navigate. I learned that I can send email from my office 360 outlook vice versa which helped me alot.
"Very ""user friendly""! The sign up & installation process was extremely easy and quick! I have not experienced any issues at any time with this app. My e-mails come through quickly and they are sent and received alike. This customer is very satisfied!! 10 OUTTA 10!!"
"Notification badge has been stuck on ""12"" for a year now with no sign of a fix. Still NOT fixed...So frustrating Microsoft have completely ignored this bug. Had to turn off badge. UPDATE: Since UI 5.1 has been installed the bug has now resolved. May have been a UI issue. Upgraded rating accordingly."
"I still find outlook app so convenient & easy to view my email, move to folders or delete unwanted mail, etc... I can switch back and forth to my several accounts... Outlook in my opinion is the most convenient email app out there so far... ( This is comparison to Gmail & Yahoo which I also have all attached to this app & can look through all my accounts on this app no matter what company)"
"Fantastic Overall. 9.7/10. Could use some minor tweaks. My only issue: I use this app as my main email client and calendar. When I am looking through emails, and need to jot things down on my calendar, swapping between the two is not a fluid experience."
I'm counting on outlook to receive my emails and scheduling appointments for more than 6 years now. I've never faced any issues during the use of the app. It is a must have app if you want to have emails organized professionally.
"Very useful and well laid out. The asthetic needs to be updated though. The app doesn't look very ""2023"" ish. Get rid of that blue bar up top. Make it white and let the accents be the difference in this app and any other. Overall I love it!"
"Exceptional email service, but it is Microsoft after all. Nothing less then perfection could be expected. I have a android, but Outlook is my primary email source. I highly recommend this to everyone, you will not be disappointed"
It's easy to handle and very efficient. Been with outlook for many years and never had a serious problem. I would recommend outlook to anyone who wants to have a safe and secure email program. A really good email programme.
Loving the new look Outlook. I've been using Google Mail for a year when I was working with a start up and switched back to Outlook when new update announced this week. I didn't realise how much I missed it. Love Outlook 💚⭐💯
Microsoft is the best. I love almost all the products. It's easy to use and yet helps me with all kinds of analysis and charts in Excel for example. Outlook Viva feature us something really cool. It reminds me of all the mails I need to respond and work on
Outlook for Android is really useful and because it offers so many options it may be difficult for some of the more challenged users to become familiar with. I believe if you like pina coladas and have half a brain you'll find Outlook fantastic to work with.
"Great user interface. However, I haven't been able to reverse the order of the messages, ie, within an email trail the most recent one on top and previous ones to follow below in order of date received. It didn't use to be like that."
"I always used to use gmail, but since getting an outlook account for work I've switched my personal email over to outlook as well! Great customisation options so you can tailor your inbox to your own needs (like me, with more subfolders than emails to put in them). Wish I'd been using outlook sooner!"
"I have to say, this is really well integrated to android. If you add the emails in your system settings and then have outlook on your system, it will automatically put everything on the app perfectly for you, no clunky multiple sign-in stuff"
"Always reliable and reasonably secure. Its a shame that most of the apps and tech stuff wants to spy on you or steal data from you. Who gives them the right information anyway, never use the correct details and vary the spelling."
Great job on the ease of install. Previously I was not getting notifications for new mail and it was taking a while for my mail to load after I unistalled and reinstalled I have been getting everything in a timely manner. This has been a great addition and experience.
"It's great and convenient, works well, hardly ever crashes if ever. I just cannot seem to change my password on the app or access other security settings unless I use desktop though."
"10/10, this app is exactly what I wanted. I wanted an mp3 player app, and this is the best one out there. No ads, no corporate gimmicks, no useless ""features"" poorly hiding microtransactions. Just a nice, easy-to-use media player for all your downloaded content. Has an audio mixer and some other handy settings as well, for the audiophiles out there. Perfect app."
"For me this is the best video player i have ever seen. But whenever i was new to vlc i couldn't find the options that are visible in other video player but yes you can find those all settings and tools you want just you have to find those things. I've been using vlc player from 2018. And i have got no issues with this video player. I hope the developer will add all tools in the surface pike other video players, it will be helpful for newbies."
"The best media player for Android. I only have one issue that prevents me from using it full-time. I have a few albums that are hi-res FLAC files and VLC stutters when playing them. This happens with wired or wireless audio, and doesn't occur with other programs, such as Simple Music Player. I've tried changing the audio output setting to AudioTrak and OpenSL, but it doesn't make a difference. Edit: Thanks for the response, looking forward to the next update!"
"Mostly great. Very extensive options in the settings. Only issue is the failure to save audio/video playlist info despite having those settings checked. Often cannot resume playlist after only a minute or two paused. Nonetheless, the developers of VLC very clearly have a deep understanding of the user experience. I can't think of a better UX than VLC, when it comes to customization and all, not to mention its versatility. You guys are the best!"
"VLC is my go-to media player on Android. Out of all of the music players I've tested, this one is the most reliable one. No ads, no data collection, and a good user interface. My only problem is that sorting by recently played isn't an option, so to just have pure album covers for music sorting, I have to choose by recently added."
"Best audio player! Just a shame that you can't set it as your default media player anymore for whatever reason. Might be why other people are having problems. Currently I'm only allowed to pick Spotify and yt music. Which both suck and littered with ads unless you give them money. 👎 Have a z flip 4, been having problems recently of resuming my music unless I open the phone. But when music is playing, the cover screen controls work just fine. Don't let it pause for too long!"
"VLC is the only worthwhile media player on both Android AND PC. Everything else is inferior garbage fit only for people who think Windows 95 and installing ""search bars"" into their browsers is a ""smart thing"". It has soooo many options to change and tweak things. Performance is also the best. And like most ""must-haves"" it's freeware. This is also one of the few pieces of software that is free that I actually donated to. I've been using VLC since the very beginning."
"One Great Tool. If you use it and think of it as the swiss army knife of media necessities, you will not be disappointed. You can stay as basic or go as deep as you need from my experience. It's not going to be as ""slick"" or ""pretty"" as some others, but I have never had an issue with it or not been able to open a file. I use another player exclusively for music, and this for everything else and music as well sometimes. Have used it on desktop for years, one of those apps I keep coming back to."
"VLC is the premier audio/video app for mobile. Update 3.1.1 however was a huge misstep. The app functionally no longer works reliably. The auto-parse feature only seems to find the files it's in the mood to find, playlists are hopelessly broken, etc. I have been forced to revert to an older version. Always a last resort and never a good option. Please repair this iconic application so we can all get on with our lives. Nothing else compares to a working version. :("
I absolutely love this app. It plays every file type I've got on my phone (including things that can't play on other apps). It also allows you to do a pop-up player so you can do other things on your phone while also watching your video. The ability to set it to just play audio and turn off your screen is great if you like to fall asleep with noise in the background. I definitely recommend the VLC app!
"Nice UI and it plays all the formats I need it to. I took away one star, however, since you cannot edit playlists; you have to manually remove and add songs in whatever you want them to be ordered instead of moving the songs within the playlist. Please add the ability to move songs within playlists without having to delete them from the playlist. Edit: It has been added. Thank you."
"I Love this media player! Just one note. Now that Android is forcing gestures for device navigation, you may want to take that into consideration for the next update. It's just a narrow area along the bottom that needs to accommodate the device gesture navigations. Gestures for the player can still be used for all the area above where the device's navigation gestures are. Just something to consider. Thank you for making the best media player on the planet."
"This is the ONLY media player that can find and play all of my WMA files! Even the Android file system doesn't recognize some of the WMA files that I transferred, but this player finds them all and can play them all! Like the Windows app, the Android version is amazing. And no ads! (so far :) )  The only small gotcha is that the refresh doesn't seem to always work. I deleted a file on my Pixel 2, hit refresh in VLC, and it still appeared. Not a big deal as I'm so thrilled that I can now play ALL of my music."
"I don't even need to go into why this media player is amazing. Fixed my codec issues for playing certain file types, and no ads??? That's so fhhcking rare now a days for android apps, they're garbage and full of ads. VLC holds up to their high standard and does not disappoint. You'll find similar apps, I'm sure, that probably work well, too. However they're going to be riddled with intrusive, malicious ads, and be a general pain in your rear. Thanks, VLC! I give credit where credit is due 💚💚💚"
"It's an app, and a good one at that. One can watch videos on this app. There are a lot of gestures one can do while watching a video to do different things, such as seek a certain point in a playing video, or increase/decrease your device's brightness. Has a night mode. This app can create an index for videos that need one to seek an area in the video, which came in handy for me once. There's no advertisements, or features locked behind a paywall. Pretty nice, overall."
"The Google music Player overwrote my phones original music player and then decided that it wasn't going to be a functioning app anymore after a recent update. I was basically left with a folder full of my own music that I couldn't listen to and all the other third-party apps we're full of ads and rearranging my music files. VLC media player is legit, it work without giving me any trouble and that's all I ask for. It is worthy of your download."
"I think they've given up on playing YouTube videos. 🥺 The stream by URL feature never works nor does the play this video with VLC feature. Please fix. Still, this is definitely the best player I've found for my music and videos. The SMB network access combined with options for slowing or speeding up video and audio are hard to find elsewhere."
"Solid app. I have my entire CD collection on a SD card in my phone and I use VLC for playback. New version is great...BUT now when I pick a file in a folder and select ""Play all"" VLC starts with the first file in the folder, not the file I selected. It used to start with the song I selected and then played every song after that. That's kind of a bummer but not a deal breaker."
"I must give 5 stars because until now, I never had an issue with VLC. Always reliable for any media. However, it just started giving me trouble today. I attempted to play an mp4 video, which I've done dozens of times in the past, but it just sat on a black screen for 5-10 seconds before exiting the app of its own accord. I tried other mp4 videos in case I happened to have a corrupt file, but to no avail. I am perplexed. I can only surmise that it has something to do with the recent update."
"Plays all my music of all formats. Used this app for more than 2 years. It just works and I can use it to play music on my Bluetooth Bose speakers. Shuffle and playlist functions I enjoy. Wish there was an easy way to import playlists when switching or resetting devices. Playlist function doesn't let me subtract music. Be sure you want that song on the playlist, or an hour or more may have been wasted when the wrong song was added."
"I have been using this player for about five years now, I have not had any major issues with it. I have downloaded it to different devices and it has worked well on ALL of them. I first come acrossed it as a portable app downloadable and usable from a flashdrive. People need to learn the apps they download and communicate with the developers that do listen and care about their product. Also: you don't go get a Walkman for free and demand a stereo, the more features, more likely paying for it."
"The plus: Reads a number of formats, both video and audio. The minus: I figured out what was wrong with the placing of random tracks in an ""unknown album"" or ""unknown artist"" category, in spite of the file structure in you memory indicates it is under the correct album. It has to do with Microsoft incorrectly listing metadata found in its media player when you rip a CD to you hard drive, both .WMA files and mp3 files. You must edit the ""properties"" of each track on the album to read the same."
"As a music player this is by far the best music app out there. I've tried cointless apps for organizing my own music collection (60gb) and found they are _all_ lacking. VLC has a great interface, logical organization, intuitive, fast, doesnt bog down my phone and has good sound quality. Also, pretty much the only music app for local playback of music on chromecast/audio. Finally. Awesome!"
"I've used VLC for ages, and it has never disappointed. I bought a new phone recently after my other one died. Since my new phone has much more storage, I decided to put my music collection on my phone. Being a traditionalist, I wanted whatever media player I ultimately went with to play only whatever folder I chose and in the order I put them in as if I were listening to that folder on LP. Well, it's like VLC read my mind, as they all show up in their proper order. VLC ROCKS!!!"
"If you're new to the world of VLC, then prepare to have your expectations blown away. VLC in general is amazing as it can play pretty much anything and this app is no exception. On-screen controls for resolution, volume, and brightness along with the usual play/pause/stop/next/blahblahblah make for an unparalleled viewing experience and, again, it can play pretty much any media file format. So searching for a capable media player; you've found it. :)"
"I love this video player, so nice and easy yo use!! You can stream to Chromecast without using mirroring, also the fact I can pick a few videos & only play the sound from them. Which is great at work & driving in my truck. Hands down, a must have app. *Once in a while (maybe once every other month, if that) it does freeze or get stuck on the loading screen. But closing & restarting is all thats needed to correct the issue."
"Updates have now fixed the widget and it now behaves as expected. I don't like the fact that when you pause the widget player, all other icons (rewind, skip, etc) disappear until you press play again. Aside from that, VLC has always been a great free media player and after an update has fixed the resizing of the widget I'm thrilled to have it back."
A perfect porting of one of my favorite video players to Android. Contains all the options and functionality of the desktop version in a compact and easy to use design. Has many advanced features but it is a straightforward application to view videos. It requires no advanced knowledge or ability. A perfect video player for the average person and the expert user. There is also a lot of plugins and themes that will enhance your experience. Great job!
"Love the app, I've used it for a couple years now with no complaints until now. After this new update the playlists havent been working well. I'd press play and the whole app freezes up. Music still plays in the background but I have to force stop the app to turn it off. Works well if I use the resume option that pops up when you go to the audio tab, but itd be nice to be able to access my playlist without it freezing on me. UPDATE: This new update fixed the problem! 5 star app!"
I will sometimes download a movie from my PC and move it to the phone to watch while laying in bed and the app is simple to use and follow with the tapping of the sides of the screen to fast forward or rewind. And sliding finger up and down on the screen to change brightness and volume really helps. Less worrying about changing ringer volume that way.
"Not sure what people are whining about... The app seems to work fine on my device. I use it exclusively as a music player. It's kind of awkward to set up (organizing my songs was slightly more annoying than I expected it to be), but once it's set up everything works well. The app supports FLAC and 320kbps MP3 files, which have the best possible audio quality compared to the more commonly used 128kbps MP3 files."
"Easy to use and by far the best equalizer I've found for my music. It puts off a good mixture of bass and treble whereas other apps specifically created as equalizers are usually 1 sided. Lots of treble and no bass or vise versa. Not really equal at all. Or they have too much gain and distorts even the high end phones I use. I love this app. From movies to music, it's always amazing."
"This app is just as good as the laptop version I've used for years. It installed on my Samsung with no problems and is working great. It's loaded with useful features and is much more versatile than most other players. The ability to place bookmarks in a file so you can easily return to that spot is extremely useful to me, for example. Highly recommend VLC."
My favorite app. Being using it for years. Can u guys add alphabetical order to the Playlist. It seem to just play the songs based on how they were added to the Playlist and can't be changed. And yea as someone mentioned once pause for a bit it doesn't resume or auto play like it used to.
No ads anywhere. No ad bar at the bottom. No showing ads between screens. None. This is what I wanted and VLC came through. Thank you. I also like the format because the app shows me all my media files with a quick scan. I turned my old phone into a multimedia player that can be used anytime offline. VLC is the best.
"Excellent Audio Player App. The audio playback speed adjustment control is an excellent feature. FEATURE SUGGESTION For skipping forward or backward we need a ""double tap"" function to quickly find an audio point. Double Tap on the right to skip forward 30 seconds; double tap on the left to skip backward 30 seconds. Great work ladies & gentlemen."
"VLC is a legend among media players. From the smooth buffering, to the automatic subtitle matching, to the built-in playback controls, to never needing to search and install a codec. I've been a loyal user for years, both on PC and mobile, and I don't see that changing any time soon."
"The interface looks absolutely amazing! It's so clean and aesthetic! You're able to view directories for other files if you wanna play something from those folders or make your own in the app! I love how for the videos there's group by folder! It's just missing the ability to sort by artist for Audio but that's so minor because I only wanted to do that since I was trying to make a folder for certain songs, but I can just browse the folder I already have on my micro SD card! Great job"
OK a pet pev of mine. So I been using vlc for about 6 years now. But I always get upset when I play a song and it's half way through. I can't remember listening to the first half days ago. Yeah you can click on ask for resume or start over in options. But that doesn't work. Vlc I'm asking you I like this app but please fix that Edit: so now I can resume easier. If I click out when I get back in long click on the thumbnail to get back to full screen video major YES!!! Changing to 5 stars. Congrat
"An excellent video player right there! Which is being successful in playing almost any media formats and streaming corners of contents from Radio to Video. Using it since 2008, how time flies.. I remember using it in my laptop to stream movies and now I do almost every media activity here from conversion to mixing! Greetings on your comeback in India! It's not just an Android review, considerably it's a multi-platform review for the 'Best Media Player App Ever'. Thank You for sticking with us."
"Leagues more efficient than Google Play Music. This application is the sams program I choose to use across all my devices, and for good reason. It isn't intrusive like the Google Play Music and doesn't have the glitches either. Kudos VLC! I've been a huge fan for a while now, and the only thing you've failed at is disappointing."
"I have always preferred VLC for my PC, and it has been my favorite media player on Android for over a year now. I love that you can override the volume limit, control playback speed while keeping the voices and music the same pitch, great equalizer with pre-amp, great hardware acceleration options, and all the rest of the premium options. Plays everything perfect on Galaxy S10, Thank you guys for this awesome service!"
"I love this app. Great work putting this app together.I do notice that sometimes the proper image of both audio and video does not match file correctly. I have many books downloaded but missing the proper cover of the book.It seems to randomly choose images for file. I wish that was a bit better. I wish the ability to mirror from phone to smart T.V. can be better in scanning for devices and using WiFi. Using pixel 3. Otherwise,excellent app to use for audio and video."
Hands down the best Audio/Video Player for Android. I've used the PC/Windows version of VLC for years and it dominates anything out there and is completely freeware with zero ads. The Android version does not have nearly as many options as the PC but this could be limitations of the device and/or operating platform. Great work from volunteer contributors worldwide. Awsome stuff THANK YOU!!
"Settings & Favorites should be located in the ""Home"" section of the app. This app has no ""Home"" section. I often inadvertently close the app hitting the back button when just trying to go ""Home"" you da best! When I connect to Bluetooth and press play on the notification which it doesn't play until I open the app and tap on the actual radio stream link again."
"My savior app. Forced from Windows Phone (Lumia 950XL) via AT&T I ended up w/ a Surface Duo 2 for my first Android and a large collection of WMA audio files (36K songs). Android 11 appears to have dropped support for WMA so all these flashy music player apps that rely on A11 won't play my collection (update your supported file descriptions people!). Well good old VLC does! Thank you! One request, and maybe I don't know how to do it and it's already built in: On the now playing screen I would like the option to maximize the album art, or at least make it larger perhaps by removing the 10 second fw/rw icons and the track info beneath it. At any rate, thank you for continuing to support WMA!"
"Excellent. Works far better than preloaded media players. Plays the media formats I was previously unable to play on my devices preloaded, generic video player. If for some reason a format isn't supported there's usually a plug in to fix the issue. VLC is my default player on Android & Windows devices. It casts video to my 4K Smart TV as well, sometimes it's glitchy but works well most of the time. VLC still can't cast subtitles to TV's which is frustrating as screen mirroring can.."
I've used the same application for years and years and years on my computer my phone's I'm not sure what else exedra and I love that you can see all the different cover albums album covers and you can play music or videos while your phone's off I mean off the screen and it searches the right spots for your videos and pictures and stuff to put inside your library. I sometimes have trouble though watching some videos on Chrome and using the app at the same time to listen to music. Gay porn
"VLC has always done everything I have ever needed it to do. I like the media controls and that it shows videos in true fullscreen without the home and back buttons visible. I love the range of file support and the way it organizes files makes it easy to separate seasons of shows if you name them right. All in all i love this app for all media and will continue to use it. Great job guys and thanks for the security patch, I reinstalled after the patch was released."
"Never have any problems with this app. In fact, I find I get more volume without expecting it. It goes from 100% to 200%. Nothing else I've tried does that as this app does. It's great for extra volume and supports many different types of video extensions and music as well. Lots of great features."
"The BEST Android video player available PERIOD! VLC plays every type of video available on your device, phone or tablet, when you want it and does it FLAWLESSLY! I have used VLC Player on my PC, phone, & tablet for years. I have tried lots of media players over the years. Stop messing with codec downloads. Get the COMPLETE PACKAGE with VLC Player. When new codecs become available, they will be in the updates. I haven't used another video player in YEARS!"
"I have always depended on the control you have with this media player, but new features, like misbehaving widgets for gestures (replace the awesome controller.) If app keeps closing, try to not allow anything, especially no gesture widgets, until you found settings/advanced, and turn off the SMB2 stream. The constant seeking for streams, + over sensitivity to gestures, have destabilized this app for phones often offline, and wrap around glass. I hope this can get fixed soon."
"Is there a way to build a Playlist in VLC without having to play each song or video? Am I missing something? Would be great to have option buttons in the playlist and search views to put put them into playlists, queues, or even play next. Also A-B Playback doesn't work. Other notifications cancel VLC playback, though keeps playing. Thank you for making VLC on Android. However it is frustrating to use until fixed."
"Update: I had problems with PiP, which seemed to resolve on its own. Also had issues w/video freezing and not audio, which was fixed by disabling hardware acceleration in settings. The parsing of media each time, which took forever, was resolved by narrowing down which folders to scan, also in settings. Now after updates, it's back to acting like it should!"
"Just Amazing. The only thing it is really missing is the screen recording and video conversion features of it'sktop counterpart. Just a really great app if your devices own video player or music player can't play your files. Devs, please please PLEASE add the video conversion and screen recording, at the very least video conversion."
"I have this app installed on my Moto phone. I've uploaded from my computer around 90 carefully selected jazz albums - mostly WMA, some MP3 and a little FLAC formats. With my phone listening at least I shuffle the tracks exclusively. For my musical uses almost perfect. Improvement can come with making shuffle mode more truly random. Add loudness normalization and my life would be complete. Thanks for an excellent app."
"Pros: Free, open source. Allows you to browse your music both by directory and by media tags - most players only browse by tags. Way better compatibility with various file types, codecs, media tags than players which rely on Android's built-in media support, which is most other players. Cons: Unintuitive video player controls. Buggy. Screen rotation bug when exiting video in landscape mode. Music playback sometimes skips to a different part of the song. Despite bugs, still the best media player."
"I used VLC on my PC for years so this is what I went to immediately for mobile on my android. Wow am I glad I did! Not only does it play videos well but it has great features to top it all off, like a secondary brightness and controls you can use with swiping around or double-tapping during the video without the clutter of a UI. Very well designed! Great work! This is the design and development that keeps me as a fan for life. Much love and respect, Videolabs! ✌️🤜🤛"
"I've been using VLC on the desktop and on my phone for a good long while now. The biggest selling point I can see is that it will make sense of *anything* you throw at it. I'm not sure I've ever seen it fail to play something that wasn't DRM controlled. Tons of configuration options, and a pretty small footprint as I recall. Good job guys. Thanks."
"If you like vlc on the desktop, you'll love the mobile version for Android. UI is intuitive, sleek, fast, and has all the basic features you need. plays media in background when you power off screen, plays my favorite media formats, seamlessly recognizes new files as soon as I upload from my PC without using any third party file transfer software/app, no ads, just works."
"Search doesn't work anymore. You search and it just shows you a list of everything. Also seems to need to scan library constantly. Would really like something simple, quick, and effective like Gnome's rhythmbox. On the plus side, VLC can play nearly any type of media file and you can adjust speed and EQ. EDIT: bug was fixed, 5 stars"
"Best free video Player. Have it on my Chromebook because when I try to watch my show which is a .avi file, the picture is always lagging and looks like when you lag while playing a game. This video Player solved the issue and I can watch my show that I have digital without the picture lagging at all. I would Highly recommend VLC to everyone that is looking for a good video player application. It has absolutely no issues as far as I see, but if I see any I will update this review if I see any."
"When a appication gives you great service for years and years, and down the line you experince a problem, you dont just drop it.,,,,,,,,,,,,you deal with the issue like giving the folks time to get the bugs out. Nothing is perfect until the code is corrected . A faster and better system is hard to come by at 3.0 or better. Works great for my system. Thanks Guys And Gals at VLC"
"Fantastic. Computer became buggy and started randomly disabling bluetooth, so this app gave me the power to transfer my music playlist to something that works. Equalizer is awesome, no hitches when playing audio. One thing I'd question is if there's a limit to audio length as some of my larger files took a couple downloads to work."
"On PC and on Android, this program is great. I like that it is constantly evolving. I love the stability on these two platforms. I wish that the evolution speed was a bit faster, but I can't complain about a free product that is better than ALL the paid ones on the market. Thank you =) Side note: This program is F!@$ing horrible on iPadOS."
"Works as expected. My favorite feature is the ability to close my screen and it keeps playing. 🙂 Thanks for that I really appreciate it. I have not tried any of the streaming abilities on my network yet, once I do I will update this review. I also used some of these sound profiles and they seem to work okay as well. Thank you to the developers for making a great app keep up the awesome work 👍 oh and by the way I have not seen any ads 😅"
Please add a function so we can zoom into the video. Honestly it works very well with the videos i have. It doesnt have any ads which is a plus. Thank you for not putting ads in this. Also its has almost all the features i want in a video player. Thank you so much for making it free for android. I normally would use what was build into the phone but my phone cant run AVI very well and this app runs so smooth.
"I had to drop the beta again, 2 issues l can think of are 1 after it finishes a playlist with repeat all on, it cycles through playing the last second of each file and 2 tap the icon to display the list over the now playing screen crashes it. It isn't easy to figure out but well worth the time to learn to use. Plus the streaming player look like nothing BUT it plays more types of streams than anything I have found. And the only one that plays a soundcloud live station I like"
"VLC plays ALL video files and codecs I am able to download or record, including many lesser known or foreign types, is open source and well tested, and has few bugs and issues. There are certainly some features I wish were added, such as a more intuitive basic interface, a better delineation bwtween advanced and basic features, and tools such as conversion and other features available in the Desktop version, but this app is awesome for most if not all video foles I watch on android"
"Nice app. Has played all my videos thus far. Fast. I do request for the ability to manual zoom in on specific locations of the video. On another video player that has m and an x in the name, you can 2-finger pinch to zoom in on different parts of your screen and it will zoom in to that specific location. Thank you!"
VLC is the definitive media player for Android devices. User interface is reminiscent of Rockbox custom firmware for the MP3 players of yesteryear. Seamless casting of videos to your television through Firestick and Roku devices. Works with any video or music format I've thrown at it with no issues. Exceptional playback of 24 Bit FLAC files. Lightning fast microSD card reading. This is the only media player you need on your phone or tablet.
"This is the only music/video player that doesn't have ads. It's free to download & did I mention it's totally ad freaking free! Ever since Google Play Music shut down, all I wanted was a music player that I could listen to all my music w/out having popups everywhere. It might not be a music downloader, but it does its job extremely well. If you're looking to download music just get an app that does it & just transfer them over to the VLC app to listen & make your playlist & what not. 5stars!🌟"
"Does a great job of playing audio in the background, I can turn the screen off and still listen, I can use another app while listening to something, it gets the job done. VLC never disappoints me. I was even able to listen to some corrupted voice recorder files from depos and it wasn't crashing unlike other apps."
"Open source software. Audio and video player that can play any such audio/video file on your device. Works great. Can play music in the background, while web browsing or whatever. You can even stream many youtube videos as audio only files in the background, then go about doing whatever you want while the video sound streams in the background through VLC."
"[I've been] loving the new update for the music player. Very simple to understand and navigate the menu system, the video player has all the settings you will need, and runs like an absolute BEAST. My only quarrel is that while it can run high quality video with no issues, I do sometimes experience frame skips with super high-res webm videos every now and then if they are unprofessionally made."
Awesome app its been the best choice for years. Only problem is when casting/screen mirroring from my Galaxy note 10 + there is stability issues. If I open up other apps the video will only cast smoothly for a few seconds then start lagging and ultimately it will cut off until I go back to the vlc app. My phone is more than powerful than to start lagging due to this. The app needs to be optimized. With samsung video player I'm able to do this with no problem.
"Had VLC since ""Windows XP"" era.. on any device I have used it on always worked flawlessly. I actually never had to use it on any device other than my computers until a few years ago I got a smart TV with android TV OS on it & installed it on that.. it works as it should, could use a UI update, it's looking old, bland, outdated but functionality wise works fine. I bought a new phone last month and apparently phones don't have a stock music player application anymore so my first choice was VLC💯👍"
"From my first downloaded player on a PC to my latest Android phone, VLC never fails to play all my files - even damaged AVI files - on my phone (!). The updates are always helpful. I can't imagine not having VLC on all my devices. It's not only the best Android player or the best player for Windows, it's one of the best applications ever. And it's free."
"Best all around app for watching anything on phone or mirroring to another screen. Few minor bugs that pop up after update, but by no means does that bring it down a star. I think some people just get frustrated with technology and I'd bet 95% of bad reviews are operator error and not the app. I myself did at first time of use which is why I never rate apps untill months after use."
"Absolutely amazing! Has 200% volume booster better than every app that is supposed to do the same but doesn't. That alone is a great reason to download. Always a huge fan of VLC on computers, on Android they have done a great job as well. I can watch the movies on my phone that have previously been too quiet to hear! Finally!!! Thanks to the creators! 10/10"
"Flawless!!! So for not 1 problem. I use uTorrent Pro to download movies from yts.mx and PopcornTime in mp4 or other formats then use VLC to ChromeCast them to my TV! Quality of videos is amazing! -- Update 04/05/2021, For whatever reason, about every 20 minutes it disconnects from casting and I have to unlock my phone and manually start the video all over again. ---- It was my fault, make sure you have ""allow background usage"" in the battery options turned on!"
"Overall balanced! I have been using this since the early 2000s.. I wouldn't know what to do without it LOL. The mechanics, the function everything, it's just simply well balanced... I am proud others that enhance sound and video quality, but controlling and having settings that you enjoy? Yeah I don't think I will ever leave VLC and having it on my phone is just one more reason that I will always back VLC as long as they keep running LOL <3"
"Best video player on the PC, & best video player on Android. This is the only app that will see my home network of 5 or 6 shared folders so I can stream video/music from my PC to my phone with my wifi. It plays ANY video file (unless it's a broken file). I only use it for video files, and use PowerAmp app for all my music files since it sorts them better, and has many features. VLC will work fine for audio files including flac files, but I prefer the app mentioned above for audio files."
"Last update changed the way AB Repeat functions, and it is unintuitive. Please revert to the previous AB Repeat operation. Also, the AB Repeat function DISAPPEARS with the auto-hiding toolbar as you try to use it. It was fine before; tap A to start a loop and tap B to complete it. I don't understand why it was changed. The desktop app is perfect, and even has a keyboard shortcut for AB Repeat (thank Heavens). If AB Repeat was fixed, the app would be perfect, but as-is, you've cut Achilles heel."
"Somebody has just de-throned MX Player! Happy to see VLC on android too. Some of the options are not very intuitive, took me some time to find them but the biggest issue is with subtitles, I'd like to use ""fit screen"" but subtitles are cropped. Subs should be displayed independent of the video behind. Edit: I managed to solve the sub issue with the margin custom libvlc option, not easy but the point is VLC can do anything."
Beautiful. The best video player available on the playstore. Just add the option to turn off the mp3 detection so that people have the choice to decide whether they want to use it for videos or for both music & videos. I have a massive collection of offline songs which increases the size of the app upto 1 GB which is quite high according to my opinion 🤔 since the option to turn off song detection/scanning is not provided. Due to this the app becomes quite heavier. Thanks.
"VLC Never Disappoints - Easy to use, no freakin intrusive unskippable ads, intuitive design, clean and simple, straight to the point. Donate to them so they can continue their free public service. I downloaded this as a replacement for Mi Video full of intrusive ads, not a big fan. Good job yet again VLC, I wish I have the capacity to donate but hope this awesome review help a little."
"Update: Just installed latest 3.5.4. And problem solved. Thanks. Back to 5 stars. Usually works well. BUT on version 3.5.3, VLC keeps ""forgetting"" the selected media library folders. I select the folder(s), VLC scans it, and able to view & play the media files. Then I close the app (background it) and then relaunch VLC, the media folder(s) I've selected previously are all unselected. This bug makes VLC unusable :(, hopefully, developer will fix in next release."
"The problem I had with UI controls being so slow to the point of being useless, has been fixed. It got fixed after about 2 years. Now this is the best player. If h265 software decoding can further be improved then that would excel VLC to be the greatest ever."
"I've been using VLC for 15 years or more, from a github mirror link, VLC made it possible to play all media. I learned to stream way back with VLC. When the mobile app came out big bother put a mussel on my media favorite and I hid my old version from updating for nearly two years to retain the ability to ""own"" the music I listened to. Old features are lost and new ones come around but IT IS STILL ONE OF THE BEST BORN WITH A TRUE OPEN INTERNET MISSION STATEMENT. Thanks VLC much love."
Best video player. With no ads. Easy to use. But sometimes I have issues regarding to subtitles. Something not match to voice. And can't correct it by subtitle delay option. I hate that. But love video player.
"I like VLC MEDIA PLAYER Which is best in my PC and Smartphones. This app is easy to use and comfortable UI (interface). This media player is 1000% far better than MX Player because No ads, No worst content like OTT etc.. Clean UI. ALL CONTENTS Like Music, Videos, Files at one place this is the reason why I love 😍 VLC Media player and Hate😤 the MX player. It is the best Streaming app In Smartphones, PC and Tablets.. But there is the problem in this VLC media player is Network streaming fix it.."
"It's VLC media player, but on your phone. No more annoying advertisements like with others. Open-sourced and always getting better. I suggest to make your Playlists on a computer and then transfer both that and audio files to phone for VLC. Thank you VLC programmers."
"This app is exceptional beyond descriptions. It does all that is is for. It keeps and bring up hidden movies or music of long that you forgot. It gives you lasting memories. It converts perfectly, et all, et all."
"It is a good player and working fine. However, there is a bug. Even though I tap a subtitle multiple times that I want to download but it is not working. I have to download a subtitle file from Google and then have to select it from the player. It is very annoying"
"Brilliant media player that does everything I need it to do. The only problem I can find is that when selecting the recently added sorting option, it still sorts alphabetically instead of from newest to oldest. All in all a minor nitpick for my media centre of choice on both Android and PC. :)"
Pretty go so far. Just wish it could deal with audio books better. If my phone has to play any audio that isn't a notification. It closes on its own. And it will lose my spot in the audio book. But at least this has a proper dark mode.
"Works well, but there is no stop button. It just pauses the video/music and is running in the background until you close the app. Also, you can't search for the next video/song you want to play until after the playing stops. I don't use this app much because of these features. I use a file explorer to fond a file, then tell it to play. Very time consuming when you have 75 GB of videos/music to search through."
Fixed! Thank you! This is a good app but I've been having issues with the play/pause button on the notification tab not working forcing me to restart the app every time. It's been happening since I updated the phone to One UI 5.
"Great music player. It's a long time since portable music players disappeared, this app makes smartphones to be a music player. However very few issues exist (mp3 tag recognition, text coding handling, playlist), I'm truly glad to meet this app!"
"I am amazed!!!! my family literally just watched me learn 5 keys and learn to read sheet music with the 5 keys 20mins. I'm shocked and blown away at how easy that was. in 20 minutes, I'm playing along with popular songs. The prompts are incredibly helpful and it detects the notes you're playing and goes into practice mode if you make too many mistakes because it can tell you need a refresher. 5 stars all the way!!"
"Being a very beginner, I tried a few lessons. They were slow, you see them once a week. This app after 1 week, I am playing with 2 hands! Sight reading is taught, which is very important. The 5 min warm ups are great. You learn the notes with the keys and can go back to refresh or spend the Whole day learning. You advance as much as you want WHEN you want. So far, love this app! I've gotten further than I dreamed! I am honestly PLAYING the Piano!"
I constantly write songs without music. I have a great voice. An no one in my life has ever worked with me. I have a keyboard I just received from buying storage units that was defaulted on. Tonight I just played my first song with music. amazing. Thank you. Update: They asked me to leave a review *before I knew they wanted me to pay them over $100.00 for lessons that cost the same for private. That was disgusting! Then tried to make it difficult to edit this review. Don't do sketchy! Uninstall
"After finishing all the courses, I have to say that my friends think I'm a lot cooler now. I can play just about whatever I want, as long as it is not too complicated. It leaves you with more med-advanced tutorials at the end, but you probably will need a personal teacher afterwards if you want to go PRO, but all in all I am very satisfied. Took me about 6 months to finish, and that was with active practice. I wouldn't wish the app's note recognition problems on my worst enemy, but its over now."
"I heard this app mentioned by a psychologist. I have been wanting to learn piano for years. I had a few beginner's books, but was not confident I was building up my skill. The app price seemed high. It was worth it to me if I could start reading music.This app tells you exactly what to do next, with options for extra practice of what you've already learned. It is so well-organized, like you're in a college class with clear expectations, and, well, simple! Challenging, yet possible. So rewarding!"
"I remember as a kid I tried to learn piano - even went to a teacher for a while. Then I skipped a class, and never went back. I never really learned the staff beyond counting all the notes from the middle C, and could really only play two very simple songs.  But with this, in a matter of just a few days I have learned so much more. There is so much content at all levels, it appears. It's getting me to be both to sight read and to play, and it's quite addicting, like a game. I have spent so much time before playing rhythm games, and this is just like it, only with more buttons.  It's a bit pricy, but it is honestly worth it.  The only two thing I'd improve about it is a) the performances are scored on 3-star system, and to get a third star you need to probably get 90% of the notes correct. It would be great if it would be possible to add an even higher ""perfect"" tier, so that the player wouldn't be satisfied with just ""good enough"", but really nails it. And b) it punishes notes that are missing, but not the notes that are superfluously added, especially with a midi connected keyboard. And, actually, I suppose, c) midi keyboard wireless bluetooth support."
"I cant speak to how well this app is for learning the piano deeply, but as someone with barely any exposure to music in middle school, I have picked it up rather quickly. The app itself is wonderful, but if youre going from zero to hero, you need to be patient with yourself and willing to make time practice. The app provides a guitar hero style song selection that expands as you progress, and that has been both fun and motivating to see my progress on those songs."
Absolutely love this app!! I have always wanted to learn piano and have even tried a few times in the past & gave up. This app has tons of different songs & is always adding new ones. I loved the quarantine challenge (They called it something else though) they did recently & am hoping for another one soon! It keeps it exciting and I always look forward to unlocking new songs by completing courses. I'm now on Lead Sheet II Course and have only been playing for a few months! I highly recommend it!
"I started off very reluctant with this app. The free version is limited and only teaches the basic of basics. They want a $89.99 subscription with a 7 day free trial. After research, real lessons are $50-100 per lesson with a tutor. Very happy i started the trial. I have the year membership now. Ive picked up on piano alot more than i thought i would. Its easy, fun and very informative to learn. Works best plugged into a digital piano with 100% key recognition with a near endless list of lessons"
"This app definitely helps sharpen & speed up the learning curve. I am very pleased with this purchase. The only problem I've encountered is when I tried to connect via usb straight from my keyboard to my phone although to be fair I haven't tried very hard to troubleshoot the issue. Overall a great app. I think it cost me for a year the same thing I was paying for 2 private, face-to-face, piano lessons. But, using this app, I've learned way more than I did in 2 private lessons. Thank you!"
"I have no music experience and have been using the app for 2 weeks, often practicing. Now I can read the treble and bass clef for one octave, and did not know how to read music at all before. I am going to continue using this app and am excited to see how much I can learn. It is well organized leading up to how to use both hands. The sound recognition is impressive but I assumed it would it have issues recognizing cords, does well on my Galaxy Note 10"
"I LOVE this app. It's sooooo easy to use (I almost use it every day for a couple of hours) and I have learned so much from it since the pandemic started (it's been 6 months now), I have zero knowledge about piano before this. The only thing that I want to see improvement on is that if you can fast forward the songs or rewind and replay a portion of the songs, that would be great. It will make it so much easier to practice repeatly the hard portion of that song."
"I play a ton of instruments, but I've always adored the piano. Every time I tried to learn, I just couldn't grasp it for some reason. After about an hour and a half into my 7 day free trial, I've played probably 5 or 6 popular songs comfortably. This method is perfect for anyone wanting to learn. Definitely do the 7 day trial, I'm so glad I did, I plan on keeping premium for sure! Hopefully more songs will be added with time, but the library is already awesome!! Amazing app!!!!"
"My 6 year old loves it! I was having trouble keeping her interested in learning how to play piano, with me trying to teach her, but this app has her glued to her seat trying to get the right notes. It's simple enough that she can run the app by herself but yet sophisticated in other ways. Like it will automatically turn down the music to help the phone pick up the sound of the piano better. Great find!"
"(Edit from 1 Star) As I said before, the app is very clean, well-made, and I like it the most out of other music lesson apps. The very minor problem with it is that the app can't hear your piano as well as it should, but it still works. The major problem with it is that it charges you $89.99 after your trial period ends, but the support team refunded me that money after I complained. I wouldn't recommend putting in your credit card info if you don't have that kind of money to spend. Just in case"
"This app is amazing! It has courses, music you can learn, and you can play at your own pace! Sometimes I feel like the program rushes you a little, but all in all, I did make a lot of progress from beginner to playing a whole song in a week! I had one misconception with the subscriptions, and when I went for support, I was answered almost immediately! It was really easy to understand and work, and then a real person answered! We had a text chat about how to proceed which is great! I RECOMMEND!!!"
"Great app!! Just one note... Wish you could choose from a menu for practicing. The 5 min practices are great as a warm up, but it would be great if you could select from a menu. Currently working on improving sight reading sharps and flats, and I would love to be able to practice that for while with continual randomly generated notes."
"Awesome! Now that I've used this app for a couple of months, I can write a better review. This app is well worth paying the subscription for. The lessons are well thought out, challenging enough to keep you from getting bored and easy enough to keep you from getting stuck. The app has a keyboard at the bottom that highlights what keys you're pressing vs. what you should be pressing by ""listening"" to your piano. This is very helpful, especially for a beginner, when your sight note reading is a little bit flaky. Additionally, the app gets you in practice mode when you get stuck or hit too many wrong notes. The only drawback to this is that you cannot get into the practice mode straight from the get-go, but you have to make a certain amount of mistakes. The selection of songs is wide enough for each level so that you can keep reinforcing your skills without getting bored with the repetition. I love the 5-minute workout option.This option lets you grab a quick refresher for a busy night when you would like to practice for a little bit, but don't have the time to go for a complete lesson. Now that the app has added profiles, I love it even more. My kids and me can each monitor our progress separately. The kids were able to quickly go back to their actual level, breezing right through the old lessons. For me, this just showed how much progress they made over the last couple of months."
"This app is amazing, and it really does work. It goes at your pace and helps greatly along the way. I had a problem with ending the free trial, emailed the company, and they took care of it right away. they are very helpful. I would just suggest in the future in an update, maybe add a way to cancel subscriptions in game. This app is a thousand times better than the other apps than claim to teach you piano. Thank you so much, JoyTunes."
"This app is amazing! It really helps you nail reading notes and how to place your fingers on the keys. It almost plays like a game (guitar hero or rocksmith but for keyboard!) There are so many song choices to practice! There is something for everyone! I could not reccomend it enough! Only problem I have is a slight delay or pause every once in a while when you play the full songs. (Only irritates me if I'm trying for perfect or 3 stars to master a song) other than that, the app is fantastic!"
"Love this app very much. So easy to pick up regardless of skill level. Also, just one complaint.. app works incredible on my tablet but on my phone when I toggle through songs to play, there is no option above or in the corner to go directly to you favorited songs which isn't a let down but I practice with my phone everywhere with a midi keyboard so it's just tedious at times having to search for what I've already organized on one platform. Awesome app and program regardless!"
"Very good for teaching and general practice, but there isn't much theory. It's an excellent supplement and good for learning but you should also invest in having lessons a couple times a month for things like posture and having someone to answer questions. The only thing I would change: Add a 120% speed. Slowing songs to 60% or 80% is good but playing them faster is also an excellent exercise."
In my opinion this app is great for those who are both beginning and have experience in playing piano. It not only helps you to play the piano but it teaches you in a way that is quick and easy to understand. Even for people like me who have trouble reading sheet music fluently it helps with that issue as well by getting you used to the notes and where they are or would be displayed on sheet music. It also slows down if you mess up too much to help you get used to the beat. Overall it's great.
"I have been learning so much from this app. I started out as a complete beginner and can now read and play very simple sheet music. I had some note recognition issues initially, so I bought a cord to connect my keyboard to my phone and that has taken care of it. Now my only issue is the app sometimes lags when I'm playing a song, which causes it to miss that I played a note during the lag. I really wish they would add an option to slow down the tempo of practice songs because some are so quick."
"I've been learning so well with this app! It's really wonderful! And it's also way cheaper than my old piano lessons. Those costed $50 a month, and I only played once a week, for half an hour! Here I got a yearly subscription, and it only costs $7.49 a month! Plus I'm practicing every day, for hours on end. Though I do sometimes have problems with the sound tracking, but that's probably because I don't connect the phone to the keyboard. Plus sometimes a useful tip video won't show any images."
"What an excellent app to learn piano. I started from a beginners level and am now playing with two hands in less than a week. It keeps you well prepared to learn new tasks. I really do enjoy it. One option I think would be helpful would be to have an option to play songs you have learned, I realize there is a songbook, but would rather have the songs you play along to. Thanks"
"One of the best purchases I have made in a very long time.  I took piano lessons 30 years ago for 6 years, I was terrible and hated every minute of it.  After seeing an ad for this, I decided it look kind of interesting and just wanted to see how it worked.  After one lesson, I was hooked and immediately signed up for a year subscription.  After just a few weeks, I believe that I've learned more and I'm better than I was after 6 years of piano lessons.  The difference is: This is fun!  It is like playing a game of Rock Band, but with the piano.  The app is super with stepping you through the fundamentals to learn how to play the piano.  If you're doing something wrong the app is always there to correct you, and work with you until you get it right.  Perhaps some people learn better from a teacher, but this works much better for me.   To those that complain that it cost money:  Give me a break!  It is less than $10 per month.  How do you expect JoyTunes to provide such an awesome app without charging money? Compare the price to an actual piano teacher or your Netflix subscription, unlimited lessons for a month cost about the same as a single lunch from a fast food joint."
"So far seems pretty solid. It lets you set up a few goals like reading sheet music which I like. It also automatically puts you into practice mode during a song if your doing bad and puts you back in song mode when you get better, which I love and has really seemed to help. My overall experience has been brief but I've definitely enjoyed this app over Yousician right from the start. Thanks."
"Very great app! It makes learning piano very simple and it has made it super efficient and a quick process! The only problem I have had out of the app is it not being able to hear my keyboard to the point I've had to set it right beside my speaker. Other then that it's a really efficient and easy way to learn piano, either on a electric or standard!"
"I think this is a good app because of the music you can learn from had it came up on my phone but just didn't put it to work. I heard some good music in mostly piano. It was very interesting to me but did not get to install it. Looking back I remember, I bought a new keyboard so I am trying out the app to find out if I can use it to start my playing of music until I have gotten a chance to go to the real school to finish up . I really love music especially piano music. Hopefully I will be succes"
"This app breaks lessons down into bite sizes that makes it really easy to learn with daily practice. I couldn't read sheet music at all to start with so it was pretty slow going at first. I've only been playing for a couple of month and now already I can read the sheet music surprisingly fast but don't worry about making slow progress cause I only play for maybe 20 mins a day at best cause my hands get cramps. But all in all, this app has been very helpful by making it fun to learn."
"I had no piano experience or music training before using this app. In just 2 weeks I am now able to read some sheet music and play quite a few songs. I am thrilled with the progress I've made and the app has many more lessons to teach me. I can already say that I feel that the subscription for the year is definitely worth the money. Now I have a fun, creative outlet to escape from daily stress."
"Day 5 playing on my new piano, ive tried self teaching through work books. But this is the way to go. If your someone who enjoys games this app is for you. I'm pretty far into it because I like the completion aspect to the app. And im learning how to play the piano and read sheet music incredibly fast. This is the beginning to becoming a musician in my spare time."
"I did not believe that learning to play the piano was possible only through an app, but apparently it is. It is super engaging and entertaining so you do not lose motivation and you start playing more complicated things without even noticing it. Love this app! I'll update my review once I finish all of the courses, but so far it is awesome."
"Only issue is that the app sometimes doesnt pick up the notes even if I'm playing them correctly. It gets a little frustrating having to redo certain sections because the app isnt picking everything up. Besides this, very easy to use and is set up in a way that's easy to learn:)"
"Yes, having a piano I can plug USB into my iPad makes the experience better than before I was doing it, but I'm a developer and I know how difficult it can be to make these things perfect when your device is simultaneously outputting music while trying to listen to you play. That said, when you plug your piano into your device running this app, it is an incredible app which gives a great experience at incrementally teaching not only piano playing concepts, but learning sight reading sheet music!"
"I play on a Casio Privia px-160. The app never has a problem recognizing notes, and the pacing of lessons seems appropriate and easy to replay for practice. I believe the app is money well spent. I do like how the app doesn't let you skim over difficult spots in training and helps reinforce skills. Is the app perfect, no, but it's good, especially considering the money you save here verses private lessons. Dont give up, and remember frustration only leads to frustration."
I love this app. I'm learning piano at a furious pace. I have found that connecting your keyboard through a midi is the best way for the app to hear the notes you are playing. But I guess Android is notorious for having a slight midi lag. It was driving me insane. But I found you can turn down the volume on the midi in the app and then keep the sound coming out of the keyboard. I'm loving that configuration.
2 weeks in and I am ever so grateful for this app!! I paid for a year upfront. No ads. Great songs to get going quickly. Love that my brain is finally starting to instinctively read the notes. Never had any professional musical instruction before this and I'm loving it! Update: Been using this app for over a month now and I'm still loving it! When I'm not motivated to self-direct my learning I just open the app and get going on the next step. I'm almost halfway thru Essentials III.
"Excellent App, Super Fun, tons of content, small bug. Have been using for two months and its just really fun. There are tons of excellent songs from all generas to play along with. Lessons are very short so if I only have 5 minutes, it's still worth sitting down and doing a quick lesson. Only minor issue is that sometimes it gets blocked on a cord (usually middle C) and you have to restart the song. But overall absolutely love the app."
"Really Fun And Effective I trialed a few different apps to learn to play after being gifted a piano from a neighbor who was no longer playing. Simply Piano was my favorite and I figured I'd use it for a year and then move on. Now I absolutely see myself renewing, no question about it. The app is easy to use, the courses are quick paced but aren't *too* quick. You also earn additional songs as you move through the courses so you have plenty to practice. I really can't praise this app enough."
"I cant express exactly how thrilled I am with this app! 7 years ago I was in an accident that I had thought had taken music out of my life. I used to play the violin, but I couldn't move my left hand right to play anymore. I saw an add for this on YouTube and figured: what the hell, right? I grabbed a cheap keyboard, tried the week long free trial and,well. 3 weeks later I'm still playing and learning. It's an absolute blast that has me playing things I never thought I could do! Brava guys!"
"Great for anyone who wants to start playing piano quickly and problem-free. I recommend this app if you want to learn piano because seriously, this app is really good. I'm learneing a lot from this app and it really helps, it teaches you to ready sheet music and many different songs.. why are you still reading this and haven't downloaded the app.. go on, I'll wait.."
Even though I've been playing piano with a teacher for a few months now I find this app very helpful especially the flashcards and the way the music Scrolls automatically for me. My teacher has actually started using it as practices for me. Absolutely love the different types of songs there's something for everyone it's not just classical not just pop not just Broadway it's got a little bit of everything.
"I love it. Allows me to pickup where i left off any time of day or night and doesn't scold too much. ;-) Actually, I could use more revue of the passage I miss so I redo songs and lessons. I go back and practice some of the songs that I completed to get really comfortable with them. I think the Challenge is the BEST. Makes me want to practice more. I really enjoyed the Challenge.. All of the songs were playable at my level. Not easy to master but I was able to complete them after a few tries."
"5 stars so far after only about 5 or 6 mini lessons, when it asked for a review. Its early yet, but Its the kind of piano app I was looking for. It starts with basic hand position and moves to reading sheet music one finger at a time. so car, its a nice progression and has begun to incorporate real songs. It doesn't require a modern usb midi setup, as it uses your device's microphone to determine if the correct note was struck. The program auto adjusted the volume level for accuracy eventually."
"So far this app has been a fun way to get back into playing an instrument and improve upon my ability to read music. This app provides a fun and supporting teaching technique. I've had formal training from a piano teacher as a child and over a decade of choir in my rearview. I always struggled to memorize the music, read the sheet music and identify the notes by ear. Believe it or not this app is helping me achieve my life long goal of being more musically fluent."
"Absolute magic. I prefer this over a human teacher for many reasons. (convenience, cost, ease, etc). If you are going to get this app, i strongly recommend getting a usb cable to connect your keyboard to the phone as relying on microphone only is not always accurate."
"Best teaching application. It knows when you mess up, and slows down and goes at your pace and has reminders from past lessons to make sure your retaining the information! This is a must for all beginners! It's also fun to play along to songs you know! There are lots of times in these sessions where you feel so happy for playing songs of today!"
"I have tried multiple piano learning apps with my phone, and this one is the best. It truly works with you on your goals, I even learned the beginning of reading sheet music in less than 20 mins. my only critic is that the mic picks up multiple notes, but that could just be my phone's mic. all in all definitely worth using."
This app is great! With no experience I've learned to read music while also being able to play the basics of certain songs with both hand within a couple of weeks. The practice sessions serves as building blocks towards improving ones skills to better play song(s) that incorporate the material learned. The sheet music and the numerous songs which summarizes number of correct notes lends to self encouragenent and eagerness to continue to learn more. Love the app!
"I LOOOOVE this App if you're Serious about learning to play keyboard this IS the App to use. Yes there's a fee but it's TOTALLY worth it. I advanced FAST, songs are up to date too. I'd give 100 Stars if I could, all you need is 30 minutes a day. If you can dedicate more even better you'll advance QUICK!!! I'm loving the structure of how it teaches you. As you advance you'll see what you've learned in the beginning puts the songs together in the End. Thank you to the Developers of this App!!!"
"Piano teachers are expensive. Having said that, $100 for 6 months is not a bad deal (or $150 for a year). The app sometimes doesn't hear a key (gotta be in a quiet setting or raise the keyboard volume). But the pros outweigh the cons IMO. I'm learning so fast. I can read music now. I play everyday. Learning piano is not that different than typing on a computer without looking. It takes time to be fluid. Very impressed by this app. I usually play for an hour everyday and I've learned so much."
Amazing app. I have no experience and they make everything super simple. And when it does get confusing they recognize your struggle and slow it down for you until you get it right. The layout is amazing and the lessons are broken down perfectly. The tips are so helpful. I love this app. Shout out to the creator. Thanks.
This has been so awesome! Saving a ton on actual lessons and learning very quickly. It's ability to hear my piano is amazing. I would have less trouble if my piano was better tuned though hahaha. One issue I have is that there seems to be a delay when using my Bluetooth headphones with the app.
"The app is colorful, cute, and it really improves your music abilities. Might get the upgraded app since my kids adore playing the piano now. It's a simple electric keyboard, but works fine, you just need to leave phone close to one of the speakers. I really wanted this bc I play the piano b/c I can imitate a song just by listening, but don't know how to read notes, so this is a win for my family! I hope they come out with an advanced app after this one. Thanks Simply Piano 🥰"
"Overall, this is a great app. I've learned a lot quickly and it's fun to play songs from the beginning. For some reason, the app does not seem to want to recognize my bass G chord. I have no idea why, but it's driving me nuts and I have to play the notes separately at times to get it to register and then it turns on the damn metronome when I'm playing it correctly and telling me I have too many hints. Recognize the damn chord and there wouldn't be any hints or metronome needed!"
"Before I downloaded this app I had not played piano before. After using my free week trial I have come very far. It is very fun to the point where you find yourself several hours later still engrossed in playing. It reminds me of guitar hero for piano its amazing. It teaches you the notes at an easy pace and teaches you to read music as you play. The only thing I found aggravating was sometimes the app could not recognize the chords I was playing. Loved the app, I wish you had a free version."
"This app is AMAZING! There are so many songs to choose from and so many helpful lessons! It helps me and my sister so much during quarantine! Its a fun, learning, and helpful app! I can practice ever day and learn new song when ever I want! I would just recommend to add a search bar so you can find songs easier and faster, but everything else is great!"
"This app is great. It does what it advertises, it gives a large variety of songs to play, and not to mention the ads are the funniest! Although I will say a few things. This is not meant to be a 1 day thing. Don't expect to be playing fluently in a week. Like with every app it has its flaws (paying a LOT of money for the subscription and the note recognition not being the best being some of them) but they never overshadow the fact that its an over-all phenomenal app."
"I was shocked at first by the price for the subscription, so waited several months before I finally gave in and signed up. It's totally worth it! I love learning piano this way. I've been playing almost every day for 3 months now, and my piano skills keep getting better. I'm constantly challenged by the new lessons and songs, but the practice I get using this app makes it fun and I look forward to it every day. My daughter got interested in it after I started, so I created a profile for her and now she's moving up through the lessons. I love that they allow multiple profiles under one account, so we can each keep track of our progress separately. I would recommend this app to anyone, especially families that want to learn. I first signed up for 3 months, because I wasn't sure how long it would take to get through all the lessons. Now I wish I would have signed up for a year. There are so many lessons and songs to do, it'll take at least a year to get through all of it. They're always adding new stuff too, which is encouraging. I have a few complaints, but nothing serious enough to affect my 5-star rating. First, I wish the app would jump to my last lesson when I open it. As you get further in the lessons, you have to scroll pretty far to find your last lesson. It seems to remember your last the song though. Also, the MIDI connection stops working frequently and I have to restart the app to fix it. This gets to be annoying in the middle of practice, and then I have to swipe a bunch to find where I was at again. Also, the lesson intros that are just videos don't work very well on the Chromebook app. I have one recommendation to make the app better. It would be awesome if I could stop and rewind part of the song (instead of just going back to the beginning). Sometimes I just want to practice one small part of a song over and over so I can master it. I really love this app, and I'll continue paying for the subscription until I've completed all the courses and mastered all the songs. I'd recommend it to anyone."
"In just 2 months, my 10 year old went from an interest in the piano, to playing Beethoven! After a few more weeks, he was playing The Entertainer. No, it is not just that he has memorized it. He can also look at sheet music and read music that is not in the app. He knows the notes, including the flats, sharps... This would have been exceptional, except that he has a little brother who follows him in everything he does. So within a few months, I also have a 6 year old playing Fur Elise, and other classic pieces! Plus, I get emails frequently of fun music for them to play. I can print it out as sheet music, or they can use the app to play it. I really like the feature that ""Listens"" to piano, and gives immediate feedback if the note is played incorrectly. Also, I really like that it allows 5 individuals to use the app. The app keeps track of where you are in your lessons, and gives some helpful individualized feedback. Note that this is not going to happen with every child. My child was particularly interested. This app allowed him to turn his interest into more than just tinkering. He would not have had the same results if he were not highly interested, and if he didn't play for 1-2 hours per day. Before he was just messing on the piano. With this app, he was actually learning. It also helped that his dad was giving him some kind of ice cream treat for every time he practiced a half hour per day. He would have so much fun, he could never keep it to 30 minutes. Throughout the day, as he walks by the piano, he stops to play his most favorite piece, then moves on to whatever he was doing. I don't think this takes the place of an actual music teacher. But it definitely allows for more self-teaching, and enthusiasm, and right now I can't afford a music teacher for 2 boys who are very interested in piano."
love the app. only problem is most of the time it doesn't hear the note I am playing so I have to repeat parts over and over again that I got right. I listened to the advice and moved it close to the speaker and turned down the game volume and it still doesnt pick it up pretty often. fix this and I will definitely give it a 5 star. really is fun and is teaching me a lot and quickly.
I love this app so much! I got to pop chords in less than 3 months! Though every time I try to do a song now it tells me I got everything wrong except like 13-20 notes! I would really like some help for that . But I love this app it is super helpful to learning the basics of piano! If you were looking for a way to learn piano I suggest installing this app! I hope this review helped. :)
The first piano app I tried was Yousician and it was awful. It never picked up the correct notes and if I ran through it and didnt touch anything or make any sound it said I was getting perfect scores. This app is amazing and tracks all the correct notes and I LOVE the metronome setting when you're needing some practice.
"Good app, but the tablet doesn't always pick up notes through it's mic very well. Simple solution though, keyboards usually have a midi port or USB port which you can connect to the tablet. It's making learningfun! Only problem is that I can't practice as much as I like because the muscles are still developing for it. There is no app for that though... One additional thing, there are some songs that they start you learning at full pace without option of slowing down."
Using this apps is a nice way to learn and play the piano. The only draw back i have noticed so far is that we are unable to control the volume and at times the apps decides to reduce the volume by itself making it difficult to hear. Overall its a fun and easy way to learn to read music and play the piano. I have advanced far more than i have expected by using Simply Piano. The best piano app to learn with.
Best learning experience that I have ever had. I would rate this teaching app greater if I could. The price is so fair for just have good the program is. You start as a beginner and it takes you the rest of the way. Simple easy to follow instructions that help so well you do it till you get it right. Another thing is great songs to play and if you need help like refreshing you can just redo. I love this app.
"Simply Piano is a great piano learning app for people up to any age! It teaches you so much like, New notes, New ways, and so much more! Simply Piano corrects you if your wrong, gives you practice time, and saves all your beautiful work! Although, sometimes even if i am doing the exact note Simply Piano is asking me to do, it does not count it correct. Please fix that bug it sometimes messes up the song im doing. But besides that, I think its a wonderful learning app! Thank you for making this!"
"I paid for thr full year. I am learning muscle memory from this APP and can actually read a bit of sheet music now. I'm learning more everyday and hope by the end of the year term to have full knowledge. They make the game both fun and also have a great learning arch. They won't pass you unless you're actually learning the classes. Such a good investment. I don't normally pay for apps, but this one IS worth it!"
"I love this app! I am in my 50's and always wanted to learn to play the piano and this app has made it so I could. I have been using the app for about 3 months and can now play tons of songs. I even download sheet music from various sites and can play that. I am amazed at how much I have learned! I have been having a blast playing and look forward to becoming beter and better as I move through the courses. I did have the same issue as others with the app not recognizing some notes, but once I got the cable and connected my tablet to my keyboard that issue was solved. The app now recognizes every note and chord I play. I am surprised by the number of people that complain about paying for the premium membership. People developed this app and put a lot of work into it and continue to update it. It only make sense they should be paid for thier work. Besides, if I were to go to a piano teacher in order to learn to play the piano, or any other instrument, I would be paying 10 dollars for a half hour session. This way I can play and practice all I want for a fraction of that cost. Best deal I have ever made!"
"Great app for learning piano. I took piano when I was young (many years ago), but couldn't really play anymore. This app is re-teaching me. So far I am really enjoying it. It is nice that it breaks things down into bite size chunks so I can work on it whenever and for however long I have. It is also fun that it uses well known songs with fun tunes to keep it enjoyable."
"Having a piano and not knowing how to play was devastating and lessons were too expensive. I wanted to learn a cool song for a talent show, but couldn't read sheet music and was totally lost. I discovered Simply Piano and it went hard at all to learn the piano with this app. I highly recommend this for new people starting the piano!"
"Excellent learning experience. Try the visual keyboard and you'll get a good feel for the types of lessons available to you. This is a serious app and yet ... it's fun! If you are the type of person who can discipline themselves to practice everyday, you could learn a lot with this app. If you're not that person, then one on one instruction would be better."
"Amazing! My favorite thing about this app is if you mess up 2 times it activates practised mode. Practised mode makes sure you get the notes right. If there are too much yellow hints you gave to do it again..1 thing I dont like and wish can improve is the sound. It always reduces sound. For a good reason so the app can hear the notes better but still, it's a bit annoying.."
"My initial impression is extremely positive. I think my kids will like this a lot more than FlowKey. So far, I do too. I like that it threw me right into music with a beat to follow. It keeps score, and if I mess up, it automatically revert to a slower practice mode with a metronome."
"Fantastic app! After using this on a small keyboard we've bought a digital piano and the whole family has taken up learning! As others have found, it sometimes doesn't ""hear"" the right notes and subsequently incorrectly states you've made a mistake which is frustrating but I've resolved this by connecting a USB cable allowing a MIDI connection. Only problem left is I can't find or access any information about my subscription after having signed up."
"Free. Perfect. Matches what I imagined the ideal piano learning app would be. UPDATE: Only first lesson is free. That's why they ask for a review before they tell you that. Classic. Anyway, I still love it, and am serious about learning, so I'm gonna pay. A few different plans, 3 - 6 - 12 months, with a whole year access at $150."
"amazing, it's so easy to use and follow along.There are so many songs at each level of skill to practice that it's hard not to find a few that you find enjoyable and can get into while learning."
"I've been using this app on iPad for a year, when I started I didn't know how to play piano but this app made it incredibly easy. I've found the instructions easy to follow, with an incremental pace to learn new steps and permanently assimilate them into your playing, repetitive for practice but not boring as there is so much music to play. Learning through this app has been deeply satisfying, and made me truly happy as I already feel like a pro. Thank you for helping me make my grandad proud!"
"This app is genius! You learn everything step by step, and after each lesson, you play a song that exactly covers what you learned. I love it! As you advance, the difficulty increases, and you get more pieces. I bought the full version, which my family can use, and it was worth every penny!"
"Simply Piano is really good! It has taught me how to do so much on the piano. It does occasionally not hear notes that I've played, but it's an app. I took lessons from piano teachers, but the app has taught me so much more! Keep up the good work!"
"It was a really nice app it taught me a lot, there was ZERO adds !!! simply piano would record on your piano skills so if you couldn't connect your keyboard to simply piano it wouldn't matter it would still work either way I LOVE THIS APP <3"
I think it was easy to learn but I'm a slow learner so the songs it gives in between were a bit fast but otherwise I think it's good but by the way my keyboard is small so it doesn't match the keys it's showing on the screen as a helper piano but I think it's good!!
"The app is great. We signed up for the annual subscription but stopped using the app about halfway in. Canceling the subscription was confusing because it did not appear in our Google Play account. As a result, we got a surprise $149.99 charge even though the subscription was no longer in our Google Play account. Five stars for Bernard for responding to the email and sorting out our refund within minutes."
Such a great app! I had a few issues with settings at the start but emailed the developers and they have been so supportive and have emailed regularly to check how it was going and offered advice when one thing didn’t work. Really impressed with the customer service. Thank you so much!
I can't believe how much I have learned in such little time. Awesome piano app! it is so great for beginners with no experience at all. I loved that I have learned how to read sheet music right away. That was one big thing I worried about if I wasn't be able to get because I am a slow learner when it comes to stuff in general. Definitely get this app!
"This is simply the Best. With this app, I will stay engaged, without feeling defeated. I gave up in the past but I know I will get past my hump this time . Cheers to whoever made this. Please keep it up to date with current songs, that is a bonus for me. Please continue to incorporate songs I am familiar with, for ever progressing and you have a lifetime member. LOVE THIS."
"This is great app. Specially for those who is really new to piano. But the price is little bit high. I know. In US that's a fair price but in my country (Indonesia) where the dollar is little high, I can't afford it. 1 dollar equals to around 15.400 IDR as of now. It's not stable. But in here, u can buy bottle of water with only IDR 3000. So for a month it cost around IDR 300k. Maybe if it's around 50-75k IDR for a month, i will consider subscribing :("
"If you ever want to learn piano this is the app i started playing chords on day two of using this app i could read sheet music on day three im already playing my favorite songs and i did that also on day three the app listens to you play, tracks your progress and if you don't have a piano there is two courses that you don't have to have a piano for it has a little touchscreen piano for those courses best app ever!"
When I switched devices I had an issue reconnecting and the service team messaged me back and fixed it in less than 5 minutes. Also after having used the app for around 6 months I've really enjoyed it and find if I wear headphones it picks up my piano better
I've never been able to read music but simply piano has helped me step by step to let me live my dream with a piano thank you I would recommend this app if you have the same dream as me I can now read music like it were a book thank you so much I'm so happy now I can play some songs Infront of my friends and family!!😃 A big thank you to JoyTunes the app has helped so much with my journey to my dream and now it's true!! This app is perfect if you want to learn piano in lockdown!
"perfection, be sure to pick all the things you're getting it for and I wish you luck. Simple, easy, convenient, and you'll probably be the only thing you find difficult about the practice. I'm telling you to get it."
It's so quick and easy and it is really enjoyable I highly recommend this app to beginners and the fun thing about it is that the app is free on the app store and you can play your own favourite song on the library and a new song is added every week DON'T MISS OUT AND GET IT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND
great app that teaches you to read music while learning the keys and what fingers to use. 2nd app I've used and I highly suggest it! and so far I haven't had to pay to move to the next level
"I got this app to play at my friends house (they have a keyboard). I brought my device home, and found out that I can play without a keyboard or piano. I can play on my account, and change back to my friends so they can play on their keyboard. Really good app, no ads, AMAZING! Thanks"
Wow! I have tried learning piano a handful of times over many years (I am now 75). I would give up because it was all about chords and fingerings. I have just started this and I know that I will keep it up. You start playing tunes right from the get go. The program gives excellent feedback. I ❤️ it!!!
"In Love. I have played long ago, relearning quickly and that's exciting. My daugter had no prior music reading before this and after a week is reading the 5 right hand notes, some left. There are easy to handle courses, then simple songs to play follow the few notes you've learned. My daughter loves the songs. You can train, the when actually doing the song slow the tempo so you can keep up. Get the app, you won't be disappointed. Thank you SimplyPiano"
It's very good app And I personally think they should download it I gave 5 stars because I learned like 5 Songs in like A-day and you practice everyday and like I really think that if you practice with a multiple bunch of stuff because that then I will just Click on every touches but now I know I'll do notes so I'm not all of them but you know and it's just very easy it doesn't like I don't have to say this but It's fun you get to do songs even if you don't know them you discover songs .
By far the best piano learning app I have used. The different approaches to teaching utilised in each video really keeps me engaged and is helping me learn very quickly.
"I really like Deezer so far. I was having a lot of problems with Amazon when I tried to use it on my Chromebook, and I just get tired of Spotify sometimes with all their political correctness and everything. And Deezer sounds great with most of my headphones, and it's just a nice alternative. I keep renewing my subscription, so I must like it."
Better than the rest!! I love love love Deezer!!! The daily curated playlist are always so good! I've found more new music over the past couple of weeks with Deezer than I had found with four years using other apps!! The Hi-Fi audio just blows me away. It is a real game changer and I can certainly tell the difference in audio quality🤘🤘 They have music trivia as well which I thought was a cool addition.
I got on my phone just to rate this app after using it for about 2 weeks this is the only app I will play no Spotify no YouTube this is all in one this is all you need after you transfer everything.. and you won't need to listen to ANYTHING else DEEZER is the S###!!! Love the transfer options over your music from other music apps... It's like an Infinity playlist of music I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYBODY OUT THERE THAT LISTEN TO ANY MUSIC APP
"I really like using Deezer because it's a great music app. It has all the great music I want, plus a lot of the more underground, obscure music that I was surprised was available! I like the U. I., it's very intuitive, the more you listen and rate the music you love, the better the recommendations become. I also really like the Flow feature which is a constant flow of music you already liked, plus some new discoveries so you can broaden your listening and find something new! Deezer is the best!"
"If you're a lover of music, the Deezer music app is the perfect choice. With over 90 million songs, you're sure to find something you love. Plus, with SongCatcher, you can easily identify tracks and get lyrics for when you want to sing along. And with Flow, you can get personalized recommendations based on your mood and interests. So whether you're looking for fun or something to keep you clicking, the Deezer music app has everything you need."
"So far so good. I think I received a free trial for this from one of the apps I use, maybe inbox dollars or something similar. My free trials and subscriptions for spotify and apple music were up so I was in the market for another music app, and downloaded this one. I haven't played around with it much yet. But they do have some pretty fun ""name that song"" music quizs I played with. Pretty fun! Haven't run into any audio probelsm and making Playlist is easy"
"This has been my favorite music app for months, but now none of my music is playing. The error message ""the requested content is not loading"". I pay the subscription fee and it's been great up until now. I've tried the troubleshooting but nothing has worked. If I could have my music again I'll put 5 stars Edit: problem was resolved, and it's back to my favorite music app yet. Thank you guys lots!"
"Hands down the best app for a music junkie. They pretty much have everything that bigger streaming services do, and you can upload your own mp3s to fill in the gaps. The app is super fast and easy to use, and it's pretty easy to organize playlists on the desktop/web interface. Lastly, they have a user centric payment system, which essentially means your money goes to the artists you listen to, rather than pooled and sent to artists you don't care about. Best music streaming service by far."
I've tried numerous streaming services and this is the only one I always come back to. It's user interface and sound quality are both better then Spotify. It doesn't sound as good as Tidal but it does sound better then Spotify and Apple Music. It's a shame more people are not aware of this app. I hope that changes because it's a excelant experience to use.
"They really ought to thank Google for their incompetence, as their forced switch from Google Play Music to the inferior Youtube Music drove me to this app. I didn't like Spotify's UI so much and definitely didn't want to give any money to Amazon or Apple. So I took a chance with Deezer and it has been great so far. Even better in many ways than Google Play Music was. The one big exception being that you're unable to play music files downloaded or transferred locally."
"Hands down BEST music app I've ever used and probably ever going to use. I love the fact that I don't have to put my credit card in unless you hit the subscribe button. There's so many features as well such as lyrics, downloads, unlimited skips, playlist so you can find your music easily. It has a Shazam (song identifier built into it.) Oh and, 30 days to see whether you want to pay for it and trust me $9.99 you will. So worth it!! 5 Stars Definitely!"
"one thing that i enjoy about this app is that they actually play the genre of music that you select. They also have a good selelction of ""where this song come from"" music. Meaning they don't just pic and play the popular music, they play it all. One down sode to me about this app sometimes is the buffering. That does get annoying when you wanna skip a song and you have to wait for the load to complete. Other than that it's a great music app."
"This service isn't too bad, I dont pull up Spotify nearly as much anymore other than for some of my bigger playlists that I'm just to lazy to remake on this service. The phone app is a lot better than the desktop version. That being said, I think with a little more time to mature the devs will sort out the little quirks and bugs. Overall I've been happy with it, especially the playlists. Search features have been super easy in the app as well."
"Much better sound quality and less issues than other music subscriptions. I would definitely sign up for the high definition subscription if I didn't use Bluetooth. Bluetooth has not evolved far enough to support HD subscription. Overall a terrific music service. Thanks deezer. Oh, by the way deezer. It's 12:30 am. I just received a notice saying my payment method was declined. I don't get paid until 1:00 am. Try again then. 😄😄 . Thanks. ."
"I love creating different playlists for parties and road trips. I love the available podcasts and international stations. The offline feature is amazing as well. You can download your favourites in the app and listen to music when you have no signal. You have many different plans you can choose from and if you need to, you can pause your plan for up to 12 weeks. With pausing your plan you go back to the free deezer plan. This is definitely a must have app."
"I love this app (been using it since 2015). Love the interface and overall feel of the app. My only problem with it is when you create a playlist with over 150-200 songs the playlist takes forever to load, even if all the songs are downloaded. I hope this problem gets fixed soon. But overall the app is amazing."
"I absolutely love this app I have been a member for like 7 years. They have every artist and every album EVER released and more. I hope they never change this service, it is perfect the way it is. The recent improvements have not changed too much which is a good thing. May be better if they would put the menu up on top of app again where the search bar was. It was easier to click search then mic button to voice search when the menu pops down from the top. IT has EVERYTHING ever OMG everything"
"I LOVE deezer! Its really neat and clean-looking, and i switched over from youtube music to spotify to deezer, which works so much better. However, some songs that I dont listen to as much (like ""moment By Vierre Cloud"") are glitched, sped up, and have weird static noises. I click repair file and it redownloads, but it doesnt do anything. Overall, i love this app!!"
My first review was pretty bad. I wanted this to replace Spotify but the bugs were awful. Giving them a second chance months later I can honestly say Deezer has come a long way. I haven't had any Chromecast issues since I've updated my app and phone. Music quality is amazing. Thoroughly happy with the app. Seems like the listened to their customers and fixed the issues.
"Was unsure about trying this music service at first as I had used Spotify almost exclusively for a long time, but decided to download it and see what it was like and I literally couldn't be happier with my decision! It seems to have almost everything that I listen to, and it transferred all of my Spotify favorites and playlists over without a hitch. Streaming sound quality is superb, at least equal to anything else available and it still works well even with low internet speed."
"The sound quality is phenomenal. I believe all the music served from a Deezer server are FLAC files. Compared Deezer to YouTube both at their respective Premiun levels. Same song, same artist, same recording. After Deezer, YouTube sounded scratchy and thin. This is my go-to app for music now. Definitely five stars. However, your decision not to include video was a mistake. I hope somebody up there in the boardroom fixes that problem!"
"Nothing to say. It does what I expected. Oh wait a minute. I hope it's no problem saying this but your Song Catcher needs tweaking. I will have it search for a track I've heard on Watercolors, SiriusXM Channel 66 and it says it can't find the song. So I'll use Shazam , which will find the song instantly. At the bottom I hit the Deezer button and magically now your App finds and plays it. It wouldn't be so bad if it was 1 in 20. But this is like 1 in 5. Sometimes I'll modify the search script and it will find the song. It's frustrating i must use another App to find the music in your library. Other than that it fits my needs But I'll give you five-star anyway"
"So glad that Deezer is available in the states now. Not sure how long it's been, but I remember trying to use it a few years ago and couldn't because it wasn't available! YouTube music premium is still my number one music app, as it is the only music app that has my genre of music (future house, electro house etc..) in plenty. However, Deezer is now a very close second!"
"All five stars review because of the Made for You music mixes. No other music app comes close to matching the infinite number of songs you prefer. I keep coming back to Deezer. This app had to distinguish itself from the leaders, and boy oh boy has it done just this. Words cannot fully describe how appreciative I am of Deezer mixes, my favorite being 'Flow'. It is an emotional experience hearing old and new favorites, some forgotten, that no other music app plays. I am astonished.👍"
"Better than Pandora or any other music app. Accidentally found this by buying my Fitbit Versa and did not realize that you can literally listen and download any song you can think of. Sometimes there is one they don't have here and there, but the great thing is that you can be on a road trip out of service and long as you have it downloaded to your playlist it will play! Also, I've had this for about a year now and have had no billing issues."
"I like Deezer. Its music library is not as big as Apple Music, YouTube Music, Spotify, and Amazon Music Unlimited, but they still have most of my favorite artists. And their Deezer music app for Android is superior to all of their competitors from my experience. Spotify and Apple music apps are so bloated and they lag quite a lot, YouTube Music and Amazon Music apps lag for quite a bit too though not as much. But Deezer's app lags barely noticeably and it's more lightweight."
"Doesn't have the selection of my old service. Sound quality is noticeably better. Was only able to adjust the eq once and now it is stuck. Weird, because other apps use the same eq with no issues. Hopefully deezer doesn't have the bs problems that other apps have. The 90 free trial is nice. That will give you time to see how it behaves before you start paying. You can download an external eq app if so needed. Update : Jan 13th. Works well so far. Sound quality is better than other providers."
"Probably the best music service I've ever used. The audio quality is stellar (though Mastering quality would be a nice subscription addon in the future), the user interface is smooth and easy to use, and the song/album/artist radio stations are probably the best of any service I've ever used. Bugs even get fixed in a timely manner (got Tidal beat on that one for sure). 10/10, highly recommend."
"Favorite music app hands down! Download capable, offline mode, lyrics, user friendly interface. I downloaded an awesome playlist consisting of approximately 200 songs for my recent trip to Florida and it was so simple to download while on wifi and then play offline while in the air several thousand feet on an airplane! Awesome job! I look forward to being a looooongtime user!! ❤"
"I blindly tried Pandora because my new Fitbit Sense requires a music service to add songs to the watch. I also have a Galaxy S10+. It was a train wreck. App kept crashing and couldn't upload my own Playlist. Maybe that phone and watch just don't work in concert with Pandora. However, speaking of concerts, with Deezer it worked right away! My watch is packed with music after only one day. So easy... the way it should be!"
"I've used a lot of music platforms. Spotify, Pandora, Rhapsody, Google Play Music, Apple Music etc... And Deezer is by far the smoothest and cleanest of them all. I've rarely had any issues with the app and when I do, it's always an easy fix. 10/10 recommend this platform to all my friends"
"Amazing àpp for music lovers and audiophiles. Anyone who can appreciate a clean simpler interface will enjoy this app. For me the most important factor in a music app is audio quality and I was looking at this app or Tidle and hands-down prefer Deezer for the user interface alone - its much simpler but at the same time not lacking features. It's cleaner and more intuitive and in my opinion much more well-designed without all the extra fluff you will never use (yes Spotify, I'm looking at you)."
"The features Deezer has & YouTube doesn't!.. so check it out (NOW),lol, Seriousyit is so much better.. they allow you to personalize your account in so many other ways . .. Sound Quality is Clearer, I mean you can distinguish between each musical instrument, Deezers music offers a more profound listening experience for the listener by allowing us to get into our songs more while simultaneously opening up the door to get even more emotional over each song. Walking in is up to you!"
"I've been using Deezer since like 2013. It's been a great music app. Do I wish it had features in the social media world, yes. But overall it's a great app, I've never experienced not finding a song, they have great playlists, they have a weekly new music playlist every Friday. And it's a great price. Reasonable and fair."
"I have had a few music apps and Deezer is the best , by far . I have one thing I would change , if I could . I put music on my playlists in the order I want to hear it . One good example is the first three tracks , on the Robert Palmer album "" Sneaking Sally Through the Alley "" , are joined together on the original vinyl record . They don't sound right , any other way. They tell a story. I think no other app I have listened to compares to DEEZER . I recommend it to everyone I talk to about music"
"Deezer is such a GREAT app to use. This app actually has me deciding on rather using Deezer or SoundCloud. Using Deezer feels like a fresh start. But, in my opinion, the best part about Deezer is that you can actually read the lyrics as the song plays on and the music continues to play when your phone cuts off. There's even a dark mode and can even adjust the scale of the audio of the songs. On a scale of 1-10, I give Deezer a 12 out of 10. Developers, keep up the good work & improvements 👍❤️."
"Love Deezer. I have been using it forever & like that I can listen anywhere as long as I have my phone, iPad, tablet or computer with me. Some of the songs I would like to hear aren't on here but I have more here than anywhere else. Nice to discover new bands based on my taste in music too! I also like that I can enjoy my friends playlists as well!"
"Deezer is the #1 music app that I enjoy personally. I've tried Google Music, Spotify, Apple Music, and so on. And when it comes to the functionality of how Deezer app works, I find it to be intuitive. I've been using Deezer for a long time, and have seen how they've have improved their app experience overtime. Finally I get to use the dark theme on the app, which I pleasantly like very much, and been wanting for sometime."
"Peace to you Compared to other available music services for Android, Deezer functions efficiently- the app has few inexplicable shutdowns or mystery ""glitches"" (like white noise or temporary unavailability) on music. The music library is of standard breadth, and has competitively effective algorithms for personalized ""mood""/flow playlists. The user interface is easy to use. using the 'introductory' service and seriously considering keeping account beyond intro rate."
"Was looking for a free service to replace the Amazon Music app I was using. Tried several pay services with none that served my needs. Other ""free"" basic services didn't thrill me either. I use Deezer at work mostly. It offers the ability to select specific artists and albums along with nicely curated playlists. Really, give it a try."
I love this app! I like that I'm able to put my favorite songs from different genres into their own named playlists. I love that all the songs that I rate ❤ goes into one long playlist. It makes a long road trip more relaxing to be able to listen to all my songs mixed up so I'm never bored or tired of the same music.😀
First off I have to say if you want it to be like another app go get that one instead. Every product is different. Shuffle isn't as good as other apps but honestly I never use it. This app is great for creating Playlist using other random people's Playlist and listening to complete albums which is what I wanted. Flow takes time to learn you but it will continuely get better the more you use it like any other smart device or machine learning software. The bugs are from needing to restart device.
"Way better than Spotify, but be sure to clear your system cache every so often. Not clearing your cache will bring out this freakishly weird glitch where the song you're playing starts trying to fast-forward at 1.5 speed, only the songs weren't meant for that so you get skips every second or so and breaks the immersion completely. If you get that, just clear your cache and restart it."
"Great app definetly worth it to get premium. Super cute too you can use your own photos for playlist titles. You can also post playlists to the public for other people to like. Big selection of music and you can customize your ""play now"" to shuffle or repeat your playlist. I've had this app for like 3 or 4 years now and it used to be free for everything but honestly i don't mind paying the $10 a month because its so worth it. Also customer service is so nice and reply within a few days"
"I have had this app for years. Usually operates with no issues. Until recently. I was having issues with my account saying it was playing another device. Did all my steps to ensure it was not infact open on another device hear at home. Turns out my account was hacked and was very skeptical that someone would help me. Turns out I was wrong! I logged into thier customer service, sent an email and with in minutes they were on top it. Fixed my account and since then no issues 👍 !"
"I love this app. I have been looking for an app that has my favorite kpop songs on it, because spotify doesn't have them anymore and I found it. I also always accidentally exit out of the app sometimes, but this app doesn't stop playing. Its very cool. One thing I would change tho is so I could customize the background, I haven't figured out how to do that yet and I don't think that's a feature."
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP...!! I Don't have to keep listening to the radio that plays the same song at least 3 Times in an hour & the songs I want to hear are are more than likely being played as soon as I push the power off button. With the Deezer App I'm in control of the music that i want to hear. AWESOME APP..!!!
"Always have what I'm wanting to listen to, can change from from one type of music to the next, can make your own play list, can give thumb ups which are added to your favorites to listen to later, great app, well done, very happy!!! Will continue to use this app over any other one! This app is pretty much perfect, not sure how they can make it any better!!!! Must give it a try. ***** Star rating from me !!!!"
"I love this app! I subscribed to Deezer premium to have full control of the music I like to hear and also discover new music. I get to hear all the tracks commercial free, in the order I choose and have the option to download the music to listen to offline. I also choose the quality of playback and download to save on memory space if I want. I integrated a 3rd party equalizer also to adjust the sound to my liking. A versatile app that provides everything that I'm looking for in a music app. 100%"
"Deezer is amazing, the only REAL competition for Spotify, which has been nothing but buggy on many android devices. I can only assume the negative feedback Deezer has received is coming from 2 groups. The first being people who expect premium/subscription benefit for free. The 2nd group complaining about missing content, I truly believe they're simply listening to subscribers' personal playlists that have music they've uploaded, meaning another user can't access those particular songs."
"Wonderful app for music. The flow program constantly has my favorites list filled with either new artists or new songs. Along with this, to save data it randomly places songs you have downloaded in with your flow. I would only suggest a faster way to add songs to other playlists, perhaps different colored hearts in a dropdown from the favorite heart. Anyway if that was my only complaint 9.9/10."
"Amazing collection. Easy to make a playlist, plenty of great playlist suggestions. Really like being able to activate listener(what song is this?) for a song and simply add it too my playlist of choice. Works great both on wifi and carrier signals. Deezer continues to be interesting with great updates. I've been using it for about 7 years now and prefer it over the other top music streaming apps."
"I used all the music streaming apps & Deezer is the best one by FAR. Things I like most: ¹Great playlist customization (set your own photos for them, random vs. ordered play, & etc.) ²The AI-generated ""Discovery"" playlist made each week by analyzing the music you listen to: it ALWAYS has great songs. (Idk how it nails what I'd like listening to EVERY TIME) ³The HiFi option. Awesome for music aficionados. You're getting FLAC - 16-bit (1,411 kbps) lossless CD quality for only $15 a month. ⁴Lyrics"
"My actual rating would be a 4.5, as occasionally i have strange bugs/glitches with specific songs that never seem to go away, other than that, i have nothing but praise for the app, it looks nice, simple to use, and it has a timer that as of a month or so ago has been officially implemented, in case i listen in bed."
Deezer is simply the best music app i have ever had. Doesn't have any of those annoying ads that those other guys have in their apps and they even gave me a free trial period of five freaking months. Where else do you get that? I also love their affordable rates. Deezer got me dancing to its music real good. I have recommended this app to a couple of my Friends and they LOVE IT!
deezer is the best in depth music app I ever created. Took about 5 hours to setup with all the music I liked with the artist setup. Don't let your phone screen timeout or else it will mess up the trial during account setup or at least it did for me and I had to create a new email as it did the same during adding a credit card too. After that setup I love how it finds music on my random music that I wouldn't think I would like or sometimes not even sure what they are trying to put across
Tried Spotify for a long time and even YouTube music. I like deezer the best. I'm glad it keeps what I'm playing on my pc and phone different. I hated that syncing on Spotify. They also don't shove podcasts down your throat like Spotify.
"Very good app for the excellent music streaming service. It is quick and easy to access all the favorite songs and discover new ones. I really like all the features to suggest new listenings: ""mixes inspired by..."" on the home screen, auto-suggested playlists on search or mix from an artist!"
Awesome! Good free or paid for. Been using the free version for a year or two now and it's safe to say its the best option out there for free music. I've just got premium and I've got to say its a little pricey but it's amazing! highly recommend this app dude!
"The Deezer application for Android is excellent for finding music as well as playing all my preferred tunes. With over 90 million offered tracks, I can always discover something new to pay attention to. The tailored recommendations assist me discover brand-new tracks as well as playlists, and the music gamer is simple to use and also navigate. I'm enjoying the power of songs with the Deezer application!"
"I love Deezer. I honestly got tired of looking at spotify's and Amazon musics boring look and left. Deezer has what I need and gives me a different look based on the song. The only thing I'd say is, Deezer really needs to expand on podcast. There aren't many. Other than that, I love this app!"
"Please bring back the ""Flow"" button in the main menu options at the bottom of the page! Or at least offer the ability to customize them. I don't care about podcasts, and having to find the ""flow"" button in the meh mainpage UI is a bit annoying after a while. Otherwise great app."
"Please! Please! Please! One more time: PLEASE! Enable the 5 sec double tap to seek(or less) feature (or maybe 2). On the left of the screen to rewind, on the right to fast forward. That would make musicians and language learners very happy! You guys would get millions of subscribers with these features in place."
"Deezer is one of the most effective music applications I have ever before made use of. The quantity of songs that it has boggles the mind as well as the tailored recommendations are dazzling. You can likewise personalize the music playback to your very own choices. In general, I highly suggest Deezer!"
"I love deezer, I've been using it for 10 years. The only thing that disappoints me is that you can't continue playing your music on your phone on sonos, you have to go on the sonos controller and select the song you want so it starts again whereas on spotify you can just continue playing on your sonos system like you can on Bluetooth. Not sure if that makes sense or not lol. Otherwise a great music service."
Love that all my fave singers/songs are here whenever i wanna listen to em!! Easy to add more songs to playlists anytime!! Getting updates on new music is great...without being charged a lotta $$ for all the perks is a bonus!! Been with Deezer for years n will continue to be indefinitely!! Thanks for all the great music Deezer!! 🧡🎵🤗
"🎵 Deezer surpasses all of the apps, so far anyways, I will let you know if that changes, other people need to do reviews as well, let everyone else know what you think about Deezer, when compared with the other streaming services such as Spotify, YouTube music premium & Amazon music. Let us know what you're thinking & where Deezer lies in your list of bests, for quality, content & layout. Im currently looking for sites with live recorded streaming concerts/DL'able, www concert sites ok too! 🎵"
"I have tried every media streaming platform available and I honestly think that Deezer offers the best overall balance between value, features, song selection, and audio quality. I highly recommend it!"
"The Deezer music app is one of the best in the market and offers a wide range of features that make it an ideal choice for anyone looking for a music app. The app features include a search function that can find tracks anywhere on the app, a variety of moods and genres to choose from, as well as the ability to sing along with melodies and find translations for the lyrics. Additionally, the Flow feature allows users to personalize their music experience by choosing their mood and the type of musi"
"07/02/2023 Hi Deezer, we've come a long way together. Please fix the bug that makes Deezer stop for no reason. Now, it stops even when a new WhatsApp message comes into my phone. I've complained on your website and Twitter, I think. Please fix this. This is not Deezer standard. Thank you. P.S. it's been going on for more than a year, I keep updating my app etc nothing. 20/08/2019 The best thing to happen to me with regards to music. All the songs I want, old, new, and genre. Highly recommended."
"Nothing to complain about. Didn't have any performance issues yet. Some things I would like to see in the future: 1. the search function from the downloaded music to also give individual tracks results and not only albums. 2.an option to play all the results from the search 3. option to create a playing queue by choosing the albums/songs/playlists that would be part of that queue 4. an option to blacklist songs from an album so that you can only ""love"" the album instead of multiple songs from it"
Love it. I've tried most premium music streaming services and this beats Amazon on content and Playlist. I only hope that Deezer updates the Xbox music app. I use Bluetooth to my headset from my phone for now.
Google Home integration is good. One premium account can stream to several smart speakers. The Flow and Track Mix features are so good that I rarely use playlists.
"Take your music with you wherever you go. At work, play, gym, etc. Great array of music... Never needed any other music source since I started using the premium version. Just downloaded the Galaxy Watch version, but unable to download any song to my watch - keeps giving error with no adequate info. Quite frustrating!!!!"
Easily my best music app. The monthly subscription is a bit pricey though. Could be looked into. But overall I still give it a 10.👍
"Used to be great app, but now it constantly changes songs order in my playlists. Often plays songs in reverse order (1st song in playlist becomes last and music stops after the song end). It's extremely annoying and at this point makes me wanna cry"
"If you're a music lover, Deezer is the app for you! With over 90 million songs, playlists and podcasts, Deezer has everything you need to tailor your music experience to your own preferences. And with personalized recommendations just for you, you'll always be in the know about the latest and greatest tracks. Whether you're looking for new music to add to your collection or just want to check out some of your favorite tunes, Deezer has you covered. So go ahead, soundtrack your life!"
I mostly use it for hifi desktop playback. Lossless quality is really good. Overall very nice and better quality sound than the likes of Spotify.
"Had Deezer for years now and I must say it's the best option for audio quality and podcasts. Absolutely brilliant suggestions, mixes and playlists too!"
"Great app, better then Spotify by far! Hope at some point you could apply ringtones and alarms with music from dezzer. Great for downloading music in whatever quality you like and you can hit 'Flow' to discover other bands and songs for related music. Great feature. I love the easy navigation compared to Spotify like, just going to artists and it having everything laid out from popular songs to albums, yo singles. Making playlists. Only negative is Price could be better. Gone up a fair bit."
"They provide best music experience, music quality is just brilliant. Thank you, Deezer team."
I luv Deezer. I have had amazon music and iheart music. Deezer is the best. More choices international... luv this. Had problems at first but its good now ..its grear 😎👍🏾
This is the best music service for HIFI audio. Best high data streaming rates and sound quality is exceptional unlike some other services that claim HIFI sound. re-listen to all of your favorite tracks you'll be amazed. To get the best sound you will need a high data rate Bluetooth adapter that plugs directly into your HIFI system such as the Lavaudio DS200 Pro 1Mii LDAC Bluetooth 5.0 Music Receiver with Audiophile 384 kHz / 32 from amazon that contains the latest chip sets for hi-res audio.
"Stole me away from Spotify and I am glad I made the transition. Love the Hi-Fi FLAC audio, interface is clean and familiar, all the artists I listen to are there, offers full downloads to devices in Hi-Fi quality for offline listening, great playlist creation, Spotify playlist import functionality, Android Auto support and probably more that I am forgetting. Probably the only minor shortcoming compared to Spotify is available user playlists BUT those are easily imported. Definitely 5-Stars!"
I try to convince everyone I know to ditch Spotify and use Deezer. That's how much I love it. I haven't had any songs that I add to my library be removed. Their playlists are amazing and I find every song and album that I want. I'm never going back to Spotify!
"I am very satisfied with the Deezer app. I take pleasure in the most effective attributes with it - such as browsing through 90 million tunes, determining tracks with SongCatcher, singing along with Lyrics, as well as uncovering our verses translation attribute. I also love the alternative to pick my state of mind filter - which assists me get oriented and also discover the ideal songs for the minute. In general, I am really pleased with the Deezer app and would most definitely advise it to othe"
"Deezer is the best songs friend for any individual who loves uncovering new songs and also paying attention to their favorite tracks as well as podcasts. With over 90 million tracks and customized recommendations just for you, Deezer is the best means to appreciate your life's soundtrack."
"An essential for music enthusiasts! It gives an extensive collection of songs, personalized referrals, as well as podcasts to ensure you never ever run out of songs to take pleasure in. Super practical and very easy to use - I'm liking it!"
"Deezer Songs Application is one of the most effective songs application that you can discover on the market. You can take pleasure in all the most effective attributes with this application. You can discover tracks by SongCatcher, sing along with lyrics, as well as discover our translation function. You can also pick your mood filter to obtain personalized referrals. You can have a great time with this app."
"Love it. I don't miss Spotify's playlists, nor Shazam, it has a great song indentifier, lyrics, sweet interface, podcasts, I love Flow, and recently trivias and friends challenges, top 3 music catalogue, I don't need anything else from a music streaming app."
"After all music apps i try , Deezer is my favourite. Lots of options. Simply No.1 music app for Android fior sure. Worth every cent."
"The best music streaming service out there. Excellent UI, amazing library and Hi-Fi audio."
this is a great app for music to use instead of spotify! I cant stress this enough!!
I love the premium version without ads. Great player and music selection. Rare errors where it won't play a song. Excellent alternative to Spotify for the last 5 years after my premium Spotify account got hacked with no resolution. I went to Deezer and haven't looked back!
"The best music streaming app out there. Best performance and best sound quality. Only issue I've had is being offered a good deal for yearly subscription then to be told it doesn't apply in my country, that was was disappointing, I wanted to sign up for a year."
The best hq music streaming platform. Everything works like I'm used to on Spotify but more functionality. This is great Thank you!! Gapless playback would be a nice future feature 🫡
"Best music app. I was trying some others, but the selection and quality of deezer are unique, especially with high quality audio"
"I really enjoy the user experience on tablet, desktop and mobile. Love discovering new music in the daily playlists."
I love how you can transfer your other playlists from other music apps. Best feature so far and is only been 10 minutes.
"I've been listening to Deezer for close or over 10yrs and I love the sound output. Thanku Deezer for allowing playlist, similar songs and favorites."
"This app has done me good(with premium, of course)and for the most part I don't have many issues. However, I do have a couple suggestions. When I edit playlists, it should show the album cover of the songs next to the name. I'm sure most people agree that we associate our songs with the pictures more than the name, so it would make editing our playlists much easier. Making playlists is the main purpose of this app right? It should be made much easier to edit them. The format makes it difficult"
I've never had a problem with this app. I use premium as it gives me the ease of use I'm looking for. It's entirely worth it. I can pick whatever songs I want at any time and they've got a multitude of music on the platform. I haven't ran across a song they don't have yet. Switching devices is easy and seamless. They've even added new features and updates through the years and my personal favorites are the release radar and personalized mixes Spotify puts together based off of what you listen to
"Pretty good sound quality Spotify.. I am getting a free trial, and loving it, look to swap over from another music streaming provider. There are lots of songs/genres to select from, really gets you nostalgic when you go back and listen to the music from 60 - 80's, Lots of options to customize your profile and library. I will stick with it, so far so good since I started, 3 weeks now.."
"I have enjoyed Spotify for many years, and I'm sure I will continue for many more. I am, however, experiencing an issue when I go to my liked songs. Usually, I can sort it by song genre (Country, Rock, Acoustic, etc...) but it does now allow me to slide to view the different categories anymore. Hoping this can be fixed?"
"Music is great, and spotify has it all (almost). I love the high quality music they provide and listen all the time. However, I greatly dislike the new large tiled layout that resembles tictok or yt shorts. The previous UI was much better as the shortcuts and suggestions were useful. The new setup just wastes my time looking for things that I used often before. I had to use an apk to get an older version for my UI to go back to normal. EDIT: UI Fixed UI in the next update I had."
"This is my favorite music streaming service, but I'm quite honestly hating the new home screen. I don't want to see previews of my favorite artist music videos. If I did I'll just go look it up on YouTube. Is there a way to turn this feature off? I want my old home layout back...... Update, 5/4/23: so glad the old platform got brought back!! I love seeing all the playlists that they have created for me. Thanks for listening to our requests Spotify!! So glad the video previews are gone."
"Updated: The real radio is back! I love the actual radio stations that updates at least a little every time you turn it on. I'll leave my original comment below for comparison's sake. Shuffle function leaves something to be desired. However, these are all minor things and overall I love this app. Good music, reasonable price for premium. Original Radio critique: I miss the actual radio stations as the playlist ""radio"" isn't updated anywhere near enough."
"I love using Spotify. It's my go to app for music and podcasts. Although, I would definitely recommend getting premium because it adds so many more features. If you know anyone with Spotify I would get the family plan so you can share the premium experience together. You can even download music so without service you can still listen on the go. Overall I love Spotify, it's is easy and simple to use and if you don't already have it, it's one of my best recommendations to anybody."
"Edit 4/25/23-Thanks for listening and returning the home screen to normal. Will continue to enjoy spotify's service! (Original Text)-Spotify has been a great streaming service, but the new UI layout is absolute garbage. I hate reels, and tikok, and everything going to a scrolling, 7 second feed trend. The home screen is far less useful and gives something no one wants. I might have to cancel my subscription if this continues long."
"I absolutely LOVVE spotify!! It is definitely my go-to app for when I listen to music. My brother pays for the family plan (I think that's what it's called?) and I never get any ads. This app is really good and I highly recommend it. The only thing I wish to remove is although I never get ads when I listen to songs, I would like for them to remove ads on podcasts. Idk if its something that the podcast creators control but if not that would be GREAT! Other than that I love Spotify!!"
"I made the switch from Amazon music to Spotify earlier this month. (May 2023) My only regret is not making the switch the sooner! I use Spotify daily and so far have not any interrupted service or bugs. The music and podcast selection is also far superior to that of my previous music app. It's user-friendly and runs incredibly smoothly. If you're thinking of changing music apps, do it!"
"Love it. I can listen to music too without ads and it's not that expensive. Heck of a lot cheaper than any other app I've tried, and when you don't pay for no ads, the ads aren't annoying. For me personally, it was like 1 ad after every 4-5 songs. Not after every song like YouTube. Makes work a lot easier too"
"Year: 2021. I love Spotify! Love the choice of podcasts and the playlists I can create. The best part is being able to say ""Hey Spotify"" and it finds exactly what I want! Well it's 2023, and I'm still enjoying all the cool music and podcasts on Spotify! Spotify has even added a new way to drive and toggle/listen to your tunes... Way to go Spotify! I really, REALLY Love the option to skip ads while upgrading my account. I listen to a lot of podcasts and when they get interrupted by ads.. Well 🤮"
"My experience with Spotify has been nothing short of anazing! I absolutely love this app! It allows me to listen to my daily devotions - First 15 (one of my absolute faves!), Pastors Joyce Meyer & Tony Evans, & more! I love the fact that I can listen to it anywhere and on any of my devices. Therefore, no excuses! Thank you, Spotify for such a wonderful app! 😍 I have never had an issue or technical errors. That is definitely an A+ in my book! Such a professional looking & proficient app!"
"4/30/23 THANK YOU FOR CHANGING IT BACK!!!!!!!!! 5☆ 3/25/23 WOW this update is truly horrible. I can't find what I need, no longer have access to the features I regularly use, and genuinely do not care about getting snippets of artists talking about things. I just want to listen to music. Been using Spotify since 2012, but will be canceling if this doesn't get fixed. This update isn't just something you ""get used to."" Absolutely awful."
"I hate the new home screen update. I don't enjoy the scrolling through autoplaying widget type set up. I much preferred the previous design and enjoyed seeing the recommended playlists and put together daily playlists ect. Tldr stop trying to be YouTube, no one likes the feature on there either. I'll change the rating if it ever goes back. 4/24/23 edit the app was reverted to the previous format. Thank you for listening to the users."
"Update 4/22/23: They changed it back to the previous interface which is MUCH easier to navigate and more relevant. 5 stars for not trying to be like TikTok. Original Review: Terrible new interface. This TikTok style feed is slow, buggy, unintuitive, and awful to look at. I give it two stars because I've used them for so long. I really liked the app until now."
"Amazing like always. I been using Spotify for over 4 years and it's been great help with everything! I used it a lot during sad times and happy times, I love how they have most of all my favorite songs, and I can listen without ads! It makes road trips very much worth it! Also, premium is very good and cheat for what it is. I love the plans! Thank you, for being a good service!"
"The best app for music imo, but if you get it, you need to have Premium bc the free version is trash. But to make it cheaper, you can have a family plan with 5 people and for 3.50 each. But I have a few issues, 1st, many songs are unavailable, 2nd you can't see who likes your playlist, and 3rd, you can't rearrange your playlists' order."
"Pleasantly surprised that they reverted to the old homr page layout in the latest update. There's also been a noticeable performance improvement when long pressing or tapping the three dots next to a song. Before, there used to be a delay, but now it's instant. Looking forward to future performance updates! :)"
"Best music streaming service avalabe. You can stream all your music regardless of the genre or artis. The only difference between the paid and free plan is mostly adds, you will get ab add only every 5-6 songs, but most of the time it gives a short add and then says that you will get the next 30 min uninterupted. You are also able to download song for offline playback on premium. This is no problem if you have cellular. Overall, far better than the compatition of apple music, or amazon music."
"Spotify switch back to the previous User Interface with the OPTION to view their updated User Experience.The new User Experience gives the person using the mobile app a Home page that you can choose to see videos and artist visualization of their music in short form or in a loop. It also give the person the ability to scroll through new short flashes(artist visuals) and new Artist that Spotify suggests to the user. I just happy about options. Hated the forcing of visuals, when I like to Listen."
04/23/2023 Update - Back to 5 stars. Thanks for listening to user feedback and bringing back the previous home UI. Old 03/2023 review: New home UI is atrocious. Much more difficult to navigate and find music I want to listen to than the former one. We went through this recently and Spotify reverted back to the old home UI because of user backlash. Hope it happens again. Or at least give us the option to use the old UI. Such a frustrating user experience.
"Ok, this is my go-to for any music or podcasts. It's just the best, but, I've been getting this glitch, where I put spotify in the background, get halfway through my song, and it stops. Other than that, absolutely perfect. It's just a big problem when, a music app, can't play music. Edit: ok, I tried and it worked perfectly!"
"Im Always listening to music, literally 24-7 and I love hearing the recommendations this app sends me. Would be really cool if we could cosimize the profile a little more and have some kind of chat area 🤔 anyways amazing app great costumer service. With you could call them to make it easier to troubleshoot with tech . But great help in the end just takes longer. Thanks Spotify!!! Keep up the great work!!!"
"I loveee this app, as I am able to make playlists to play whatever I would like to listen to. There aren't too many ads in between playing the playlist, so good job guys! 👏 I also love the fact that you have different genres for different kinds of music, and that It can recommend music for you to listen to! I would certainly recommend this app to anyone looking to play some music. 🎶"
"I think it's one of the best music apps that I've used for finding new artists and new music to listen to. As far as ads taking up space on the screen and interruptions preventing the use of the application i have not seen any of this problematic spam. The ads come in after a song,and reminds me of the TV commercials and the time they take before the entertainment/music is back and lasting for a long while before the next ad will play out."
I am one of America's . 05 percent of top listeners. In honor of mental health awareness month I wanted to offer a review from a unique perspective. This product is so gross-platform that it ended up changing my life. As a person living with PTSD and other related mental health issues I found that being able to really build strong playlist infrastructures to sort my 400+ lists has allowed me to have soundtracks I can easily navigate to help me with music therapy and reintegration of the world. ❤
"I been using this app since 2019 and Its amazing. I got the subscription for this app because the ads were getting annoying but besides that. There's only two issue and i hope will be fixed soon. The only down side really is connecting to any devices. I have an Alexa i like to play music on and everytime i turn up the volume on the app, the alexa turns up at the loudest volume and its highly infuriating. The shuffling is also very bugged like it keeps playing the same songs and repeats some."
"Personaly i think the app is great! It doesnt freeze or doesnt take forever to load. You just have to create your liked song playlist by searching up songs and pressing the heart, then go to library and press liked songs and there you go and if you listen to it and then stop listening to music you open the app and on the home page it says recently played and it will say your liked songs and you just click it so you dont have to go to library and do all of that and if you want shuffle mixes it up"
"This app has way more music than Audiomack and you can listen to all of it for free. The ads aren't annoying and I like the fact that there's a chance you get 30 minutes ad-free. It allows you to get a taste of Spotify Premium without getting it. If I had a job (I'm underage), I'd pay for premium."
"I have countless albums that I have downloaded on Spotify and playlists that are endless and when I say endless I mean it! All my playlists have been hand picked by me, I don't think I could listen to them all even if I live to be 100 years old!! That's no joke Spotify rocks and I love it and the app is very easy to use/understand, only one drawback and it's the ads/commercials you can upgrade for a small monthly fee, and then you won't have to hear any ads!!"
"I love Spotify! Streaming my own music all the time is the only way to go. I dig that a lot. Spotify premium has been my very favorite for many years now and you can't beat this kind of entertainment for the price! It's less than $10 a month for me to streem at home & in my car. That's almost as good as free! Thanks Spotify! I'm glad I met you. Sincerely, Trisch A."
"Doesn't have many of the common flaws among any other streaming platforms, doesn't interfere with device functionality. The interface is a bit confusing at first, but easy to get used to. It plays in the background without premium. It's easy to access the extra features that Spotify offers other than just music streaming. I use it more than anything else. 100% recommend 👌."
"I LOVE my Spotify. I was grew up with a lot of exposure, and therefore appreciation for all different genres of music. I've used other streaming mediums, and Spotify has more songs, more music and podcast varierty (even hard to find ones), and more versatility with devices and apps that you can share your media with. I like the newer ""DJ Mix"" options to add variety and spice to your mundane tunes. I'd love to see some full mixsets, one day, but I still love my Spotify."
"Just stopped by to update, so I can't vouch this, but I've been using this app before it was spotify, and it was on a site Napster. AND it took all day to download 3 songs. Great app. Good algorithm, starting to get a little pushy. Great place to find your old favorite, great place to discover. Never had any issues with performance and intuitive controls. Napster BAD!!!! with that I Did you a good evening."
"Update: been working very well as of late! Old: This is my most expensive subscription. The audio cuts out literally all the time. In fact, it has cut out 2 (now 3 times) times just while posting this. I'm current on updates. Every 30-40 seconds I have to open my phone back up and press play. Many times the media player will not even show up when I select content."
"Premium is worth it if you're a student, that discount including Hulu is 🔥. I like the integrations with other apps and how my friends and I can listen simultaneously. I can host and change what everyone is listening to. I can listen with anyone that let's me. Being able to download songs is worth it on long drives. Just wish there was a way to add lyrics when they're aren't any. I've seen some songs lose lyrics after having them prior. Unsure what's going on there. Still a good app."
"This is a really great app for if you want to text your friends while listening to music or playing games while listening to your favorite sound track, The few things that kinda annoys me is how you get three or four adds at once I'm not as annoyed as it as I was before also another thing that's slightly unfair if you will, Is that if you have Spotify on console you'll get to pick specificly what music you want to. However on mobile It'll always be shuffled."
For the last 10 years I've been using Pandora as my music streaming app. I've been exploring Spotify for over a month now and I really love it. I do think adding a Thumbs Down or dislike button would make it better however there is the option to remove a song but still believe giving the the users the option to vote down songs they don't like would make the experience better.
"I'm pretty stoked with basic subscription having used the free service for about a year prior. The free service, allllllmost drove me back to YouTube , but I called myseld out on being too cheap, three causation to the wind, and spent the $10. I have not considered leaving Spotify since. I do however think that an additional listener with that package isn't what everyone wants, and would prefer paying $6 or $7, for just me. I can't afford to serve music to everyone on the planet .😜"
New UI for the app is terrible. Looks like TikTok but songs are more than just 15-20 seconds. Also don't see my new releases anymore. Swiping up and down between the tiles is dump. Give an option for the old UI or just ditch the new UI completely. Edit: back to five stars now that the old UI is back. Thank God.
"I use it everday, I love Spotify, it is superior, it's just annoying that you can only listen on shuffle play on mobile without premium, and sometimes if you're on a playlist it plays other music. When i'm listening to Afi I don't want to hear Bob Dylan out of nowhere, I want to hear Afi. Besides that it is very poggers, 9.25/10, would reccomend."
I love it!!! My favorite music streaming app out there! I especially like being able to crossfade songs and add whatever picture I like to my Playlist covers. All the way around a great music app. Great personalized playlists as well and I always look forward to the discover Playlist every week. Much love!!!!
I love spotify! But lately it wont play anything unless its downloaded. It says I have no internet connection even if I have full bars AND wifi. The only way it fixes is if i delete app and redownload. But then it happens all over again a day or two later :( I have premium. But every time I have to do this I have to redownload everything I had downloaded previously. Please help!
"Been using the app for quite a while. Since the last update, the audio sounds like a full size vinyl running on the 45 setting. Hoping this helps get the situation resolved. Edit: operator error caused this issue. Someone that knows more than me with the assist."
"Oh Spotify is just so wonderful! I believe this is the best music monthly purchase I've made in my life. I also started a podcast recently and I'm pumped to be able to share it on this platform especially. Only constructive criticism I'd like to add is that over time, as much as I love the personal playlists they give you, eventually genres overlap too much. For example, Blink 182 has always been one of my favorite bands, but I don't want them in a hard rock playlist. Just some thoughts."
"Five stars because when you're coming off Amazon Unlimited, who's mobile app has not worked properly for the past year or longer, tapping ""play"" in Spotify and hearing your music actually play right away, and not 3 hrs later, becomes something phenomenal. So - there you go. 5 stars simply because the flipping app responds how it's supposed to. It's the little things, right?"
"I love this app, when I walk somewhere, I put on Spotify. I think this app is better than like Pandora or any others. The adds arnt horrible. You can listen to like 5 or 6 songs and then after that, you might get 1 or 2 adds. If you are wanting to listen to something else, you'll have to listen to a add before exploring other playlists by other artists. This app is recommended for people who like their music. Have fun with this app and just listen to your favorite music!!"
Best music and podcast app in my opinion. Just a few things. I wish there was the ability to sort downloaded podcast episodes by oldest date to newest. Second is the home UI needs changed or reversed. It feels very unorganized and nonpersonal. Third is hi def lossless audio needs to hurry up and be added.
"Spotify is the perfect music streaming app! I really do love this platform. You can look up songs with just the lyrics, and you can make playlists with no limits. Spotify has almost all songs available! It gives you song recommendations based off of the music you tend to listen to and the platform is extremely user-friendly! 100% satisfaction guaranteed! ♡"
"For the best experience, you need premium. I recommend every user to turn off auto-play, especially if you are not a premium member. It will play suggested songs after a playlist ends and it used to drive me up the wall. Okay, but Spotify is a really great service that I use every day, I recommend."
"Spotify is the best! I love the fact I don't have to hear a bunch of D's, News, & commercial interruptions. I listen to New Age Music and believe me it's a pain in my backside if I want to hear a couple of ballads rather than having to purchase CD's. I can make my own ballads from different CD's. With all the companies price gouging due to this crazy economy. My monthly pricing so far , has only increased once and I have had Spotify for 5+ years. Thanks a bunch Spotify!"
"Spotify is absolutely amazing. I can find all of the music that I love from all of my favorite artists. They have 100's of thousands of songs, podcasts, and easy listening, all for a great price! Heck, if you don't want to pay, all you have to do is listen to 1 to 2 ads for unstoppable 30 minutes of free entertainment. Anyone looking to try Spotify should definitely download it"
UPDATE: The UI still sucks but it's not bad once you figure out how to jump back and forth between regular and smart shuffle recommendations. I still wish the home screen had everything I needed instead of clicking options to get to my specific playlists. UPDATE: Thank you for getting rid of that infinite scroll that took too long to load and bringing back the original home screen.
Spotify is an excellent music engine. But I'm not going to lie every now and then there are some bugs that are highly aggravating. Such as if I'm listening to music for about 10 minutes or half hour. It will randomly shut off I'll turn it back on and then it'll do it again and again and again. I do rate this at five stars because it's very good it just has a few issues that need to be addressed and I'm sure at some point hopefully in the future they will fix. I have used Spotify for the past 8y
"I feel like everyone is bashing on the new updates. I've been using spoitfy since 2013, and even with the changes, it's the easiest music app to navigate. I love the new DJ feature for when I can't figure out what I want to listen to. I can build and add songs to my playlists while I'm listening to them. My only main concern is my app glitches, so my genre selection in my likes freezes and won't scroll."
"Been using this for years and I loved it. But this year the app is kinda glitchy on my OnePlus (Android 10) such as sometimes play bar not showing up on the app and playback not showing on notification page. Would be great if it's fixed! Update: I think it's fixed now, thank you! And love Blends feature as I like to mix music with friends. Social media music next maybe?"
"I love this app. It is worthy to meet my long terms passion for all types of music I listen to. At first when I bought the monthly plan I had been hesitant before a long time about paying for ads, offline capabilities, high quality audio. This is coming straight from a guy that's always download MP3 music, until I finally got Spotify. I still kinda feel there is room for improvement. Like pay monthly every few months to get two months for the same price as long as you keep the streak going."
"I love spotify and have used it for years (I have premium). The only thing I want to mention is that when I put my Playlist on shuffle play it just repeats the same 50 or so songs (my Playlist is about 17 hours long). This is the case no matter what I do. I have re sorted my list several times, uninstalled and reinstalled the app and I even made a much shorter list of about three hours and it still only repeats a portion of the songs (about 10). Other than this I live for spotify and am happy :)"
I have used Spotify pretty much since it first launched on PC. Never have I been disappointed with a new feature when they have added content and yesterday the DJ feature is amazing for just relaxing and letting it mix your played music with new music and throw backs to what you use to listen to. Not to mention the shared playlist and the fact that others on the same wifi network are able to join in and play songs which is great for parties.
Personally my favorite Music app but it does cost money to make your own music playlists. So be aware unless your not worried about commercials. If not memberships are not too expensive but you can literally listen to playlists and music by your favorite artists and you can design your own and download them so you can listen to all your favorite music where ever you go.
"I love the new ""enhanced"" playlist feature, where suggested songs are incorporated. But please allow us to still sort my playlist by ""date added"". I hate that it automatically becomes sorted in reverse - with my oldest songs at the top. I add in new songs and want to listen to those first but have to scroll to the bottom to find them."
"For lovers of multiple genres of music or those whose taste in music varies in mood and situations, I could not recommend this app highly enough. You can custom your Playlist, explore new music and even try songs you might never have otherwise. Plus podcasts, variety of music , and the independent artists you can discover easily on here makes it more worth the time. 10/10. For people who have a small set Playlist or go to genre, thus app is also great for that. Easy to find music you love."
"Low key the best music app I've ever used. It has songs that I didn't even think I could listen to through the app, and before i got premium, the ads weren't that bad. I don't know if that's still the case, that's just from my personal experience. There is one thing, though. If you have premium, most audiobooks should be free/cheaper. I still get why you would have to pay, but still. Other than that, it's a really great app! Totally recommend."
"I've been using YouTube for listening to music for waaaaay too long. Constant commercials and get rich quick and fitness ads. And the ""are you still listening?"" Thing drives me crazy! And the asinine thing when you skip an ad. Do you want to continue to your song? Or would you prefer to sit in silence for the length of time that ad would have played. 🙄 Unbelievable! I'd been hearing about Spotify, and decided to check it out. Loving it! 👍"
"I love my playlists, I don't like the suggested songs appearing after I've indicated NO in the Settings. That's the only complaint. Other than that, I love Spotify. I have other music apps, but I only use Spotify daily. And thanks for putting in lyrics -my absolute favorite part. Keep up the good work and I look forward to seeing great things from this app."
"I've used spotify for at least a decade. It's great for holding your library anywhere and everywhere you go. I'd say I wish you didn't have to pay for it. But artist's have to make money too; plus, you only have to pay if you want premium, with no ads. An endless selection can't always be found. That sucks. But it's not YouTube, so eh. Takes time to track revenue. I'm certainly sticking around. I like having my music offline anywhere I please."
"I like using this app over youtube, as it has fewer ads per hour overall and works great for the flow of my playlists. Note, this review is only for my experience with mobil app, not for pc which is highly superior to mobil options wise. My personal opinion is that all app options should be equal, no matter what device, or modle of device one is using. It's a bit unfair to users at the moment as options differ greatly from one to the next. Remove looping autoplay playlist adds. Thx"
"One of the best music streaming services I have ever used. Has the most amount of music while also being able to manage it in a more organized way, unlike YouTube Music, and offers great low-signal app performance. Only things I wish for is higher quality audio and the ability to upload and play your own MP3's of songs that are not on the service. There only 10-20 of them for me, which makes it annoying, but I keep coming back to this service over every single one out there, including TIDAL."
There's pretty much everything for music on there.. being a premium member allows you to listen to all your playlists offline and the ability to cast to your home stereo as well as Bluetooth speakers all you need to do is download your music... Love the app as I never have issues with freezing or crashing it just works the way it is supposed to
"Spotify is a great app for several reasons: 1. Massive music library: Spotify has a massive music library with millions of songs, making it easy for users to find and listen to their favorite songs. 2. Personalized recommendations: Spotify uses machine learning algorithms to analyze users' listening habits and provide personalized recommendations. This makes it easier for users to discover new music that they might like."
My experience with this app after over 10yrs has always been positive. I love making playlist especially for long periods that we sometime spend in automobiles travelling. It is very nice to be able to listen to the genres that you want not to mention the artists that you love to hear. I would recommend this app to anyone who loves music of any genre. It is a game changer when it comes to having the music at hand that you want rather than having to listen to a radio broadcast.
"Awesome!! Huge selection of artists and songs. Love the layout and ease of use. Everything you want or need musically is here! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Update 4/19/23.....Still 5 Stars!!.....And that's using the free version with the ads. The minimal, brief interruption is nothing in comparison to radio and the selection of music is phenomenal. I am in love 💕 with this app!!"
"You guys like to downgrade and remove options for no reason. New lyrics underneath the songs? Amazing. Removing the feature when you add an album to a playlist and it asks you if you wanna add duplicate songs that already exist in your playlist? Not amazing. I have thousands of songs on my playlist, I cannot afford to check for duplicates individually nor the time to add songs individually which is where it comes in handy."
It's the best music app. I really like the DJ idea but I feel like we need to be able to pick a genre or at least nudge it a certain way. I'd love to be able to customize it more. Like how many songs it'll go before changing or what genre or mood it's looking for. I also wish it was able to be more integrated than just a playlist. It should be in the top corner of the front page
"Tbh I hate the ads so much that I purchase premium every month, and it's sad to say that my money goes to music, but I've been storing all my favorite songs here since 2017, after pandora became unpopular. Regardless of having to spend $9.99 every month just to listen to music comfortably, I can say that it's the best music service I've used. I don't have to download each song individually, Instead, I can add them to playlists and download all in a quick amount of time. -"
"It's great, I switched from Pandora and will never go back. Like yes you do have to pay to have things your way like your own playlist and no ads. It's definitely a lot easier to use than Pandora. The one thing I do with they add is if a song is in you can ""record"" that part of that song that's playing so you know what it is."
"Spotify is a great app and I use it almost every day, and it would be 5 stars if the only version of my favorite song that I will listen to hadn't been taken off so I couldn't listen to it. If spotify tries to fix this the song is ""I don't care"" by Apocalytica feat. Adam Gontier. Edit: Problem was fixed and I am now able to listen to my favorite song happily."
I am a music lover and this app makes it so easy for me to listen to the music I love. Now I personally have Spotify premium which in my opinion is 100 times better than not having premium because you have no ads and as many skips as you want. But either way Spotify is easier to use and it makes it easy to connect with people like friends or just people who have the same music taste as you.
"I've really got NO COMPLAINTS. In exchange for listening to a few ads here and there, I get limitless access to music that I WANT TO HEAR. I love Spotify. I love being able to create my own playlist, a different one for different moods, days, chores, etc. I also like that the app creates playlists FOR ME based on my likes; I've heard many long-lost favorites this way. Thank you Spotify, for enabling those of us on fixed incomes such an easy-to-use and enjoyable music ""solution!"""
There's not much to complain about. The quality of the music and the vastness of music tastes are nice to explore. But I do wish it was easier to navigate my own playlists. I had all my playlists on my homepage just so I don't get so lost searching for old playlists. But I don't get that option anymore. :/
"I love this app, I can find some of the most obscure things here. One day I even found an old recording of a local band from the 90s that I used to follow.. Spotify has completely replace my CD collection (yes, I'm old) and 90% of my radio time. Between podcasts and playlists, I'm pretty much Spotify all the time."
Thank you for removing the ridiculous tiktok UI & making things more streamlined again
"I like this app. It is easy to find the songs I love . I love how I can set a song for alarms, messege, or email. I don't mind the ads, but I wish there weren't so many. I haven't had the app long, and it has an update . When I was reading the reviews, people said they had different issues, so I am going to put that off ad long as I can I will follow up when I've had the app longer"
"I have been with Spotify since it first appeared on the scene. Before I had Pandora. I've had nothing, but an ideal experience with Spotify and have watched it grow into what it is today. I still feel this is the best app and it's rare I have issues with the app. So if you're someone who uses other similar apps and tired of the cost rising and not happy. Spotify is the definitely the go to for all your music needs, also being able to listen to some of my faves like Mr. Ballen on the app is a +"
"This is a great app for listening to your favorites as well as discoverying new beats. Fully functional favorites and playlists and super easy to share with your family and friends. Then there are the podcasts, many you are free and exusive to Spotify. I highly recommend you give it a try."
"It's Spotify duh. I've used it for years now and I tried just about EVERYTHING out there for streaming music and honestly, with all the devices that I have, and the variety of music selections available, nothing else is going to compare. However, if you don't mind ads every 15 minutes or so, free is fine. Better than the usual. But, no way would I ever want to go free vs premium again. World of difference in quality, download ability, and no ads.... straight music. Spotify...it's family..."
"I love using Spotify to create and listen to playlists, as well as discover and listen to the ones they've created for me. I can also sort playlists and songs in my playlists, which I find really helpful. My only grumble is there's no Garth Brooks, but I try to content myself with otherwise HUGE selection of songs. It's a pretty intuitive app and I enjoy using it!"
Incredible Stopped listening to music on the radio years ago because of the commercials and the yammering of the DJ's! Now I just have music...My music and the ability to hear some new music with Spotify suggestions! And don't get me started on the podcasts! SMARTLESS! If you needed a good laugh that is where you go!
"App is rather slow at times, clunky, and in need of a UI overhaul. Also experiencing an issue where it freezes completely and grays out the bottom of the interface. I can replicate this when opening the app fast and go right to playlists. Makes the app completely unresponsive..."
"If you love a certain genre of music (and who doesn't ?) this app/service is just the ticket to find both artists and suggestions for similar artists/performers to that particular (or similar) style(s). It is possible to branch out in many different directions, often finding delightful ""treasures,"" or rediscovering artists and music that had somehow moved to the background over time."
UPDATE: I might have the beta version because no one else I know has the same set up for spotify. I like most of the updates. The DJ is a really cool option to shuffle my music and discover more artists. They should add a request button so I can add the songs to the queue while using the DJ. ONE THING: please change the home screen back! That's all that's missing
"Please 🙏 read about these ideas. Over lap crossplay with podcasts and Playlist. Maybe even song suggestions with podcast. Saving to Playlist option- tap and hold to apply to multiple Playlist. While listening to Playlist- option to delete song within sidebar please 🙏 After adding to Playlist, information of the current song is minimized to the bottom of the screen. I'm brought back to the app home screen or the album I was looking at. Please allow us to fix this feature. 🤞🏽"
At this point I'm listening to 3-4 minutes of adds to listen to a single song. Sometimes I'll listen to 7 or more adds before hearing another song. It's a great app for music but if your not paying for premium then the adds are just so pescky and annoying. If there could be slightly less adds between each song (2 or less) the review would be 5 stars.
"Spotify is great IF you have premium. The base version tries to annoy you every way possible with adds and a limited amount of skips, and not being able to play the songs you want to, but if you get premium, it is easily the best music app. There are so many different bundles and deals which you can use to make it cheaper, for instance taking a family plan and splitting it between six people which leaves you spending about two dollars a month. Most reviews are about the base version. Get Premium"
"For the last 5 years everything has run smoothly, but, for the last 3 month's there has been some major glitches such as; playlist randomly unloading themselves and the cross-fade option seems to pause the music and then start the new track as if there was a time gap between songs. Overall Spotify will always keep that reliability and sound quality. Keep up the good work and dedication."
"Update: all the commentaries and reviews seems that helped. The Tik Tok like UI is gone and the app is usable again. Much appreciated! The new UI is useless, the tiles occupy a lot of space on the screen, they are hard to navigate and most of all, many of them have nothing to do with my music or podcasts. I can't find my mix playlists and can't explore for new music. Instead I get recommendations for christian podcasts. I hope I won't have to switch to other apps for music"
"Spotify is a fantastic app that deserves a 5/5 review. The app offers a vast library of music, including both popular and niche genres. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it simple to find and play your favorite songs. Additionally, the app's personalized playlists and recommendations are spot-on, making it easy to discover new music that you'll love. One of the best things about Spotify is its ability to sync across multiple devices."
"I've been using spotify for the last 4 years. In the 1st year, I used the free version. Afterward, I began paying. Here are my thoughts: Overall user experience is great. I love the home page. Its simple & clean. I'm not overwhelmed with options. The 'enhance' for playlists is a great way to find new music. Based on my listening history, the suggested playlists and songs spotify offers are aligned to what I like, resulting in me saving them 8/10 times. The new AI Dj is so dope!!!"
"I have to say, I am very happy with this app. I waited over a year before I decided to just give it any stars. I think the apps performance on all my android devices both high end and low is better than most(Prime, HBO and others). I like the download options for quality and download location. The continent is easy to find or search. Support for older builds of Android is nice as of this review."
"Best mobile app for movies/TV. The other apps aren't as easy to pinpoint how to use especially for the elderly. This doesn't make you always have to reenter card info to renew your monthly subscription. Hulu is included with this for 10.99$(w/ ad price) You don't have to sit and wait for buffering or have to download what you wanna watch. Easy to load, the ads are okay. At least you can easily watch TV without numerous ads they play at the same time! Doesn't take too much space up either."
"I love the app, love the layout, love the content... I just wish there was a ""start from the beginning"" option in a movie or shows menu when I plan to rewatch something. I may end a movie 5 minutes early, during the credits. When I want to rewatch that same movie, there's only a ""continue"" option. Now I know there's a restart option once the movies starting but I feel like we can skip a step here. I want to reiterate that I love this app. This is just a very minute gripe."
"I love Disney+ as a whole. As a streaming service, it great, but as an app, it's just... Ok. What bothers me the most is that it doesn't recognize that you've completed a movie unless you watch ALL of it. For example, you watch a movie and exit out of it when the credits roll. But you didn't finish the credits, so it still shows up in the ""Continue Watching"" section. If it were changed so that the app would recognize when you exit for the credits so that counts as finishing, that would be great."
"There needs to be a 'continue watching' or 'next episode' feature. It's very annoying to have to search and scroll through the whole page just to continue with your show or movie. This is a feature on Netflix and Hulu and I feel it's vital to a great streaming experience. Having to manually search for and start episodes or movies is not very streamlined. Edit: with the update, I have no complaints!"
"It's like the app was made for someone that had no intentions of checking that it works. There's so much content and something for everyone. However... that's as good as it gets. I have an S8+, I go to stream and it shows a buffer symbol for a few seconds then goes all black. Nothing ever happens. Go to add items to watch list/my stuff, it shows a check mark like it added, but when you change screens and come back it has the add symbol again. It saves nothing and streams nothing. So far, useless"
"A great streaming service, it has more content I enjoy than alternatives like Netflix. The only problem is that it has no ""Continue Watching"" button, so when I want to resume something, I actually need to go through all the menus to find the specific program so I can continue watching it. A ""Continue Watching"" section would be very helpful. UPDATE: They added it. One more ⭐"
"This is a great app. Love that they added the continue watching feature. Haven't come across any bugs or glitches. Only other thing is they need to make an app for a computer. I have a surface tablet I like to watch on but because Disney+ is only available on a website, I can't download any episodes or movies to watch while traveling. Hopefully something is in the works."
"[[EDIT: thanks for the repair with the updates. All is working well now. ]] Looks great!!! Unfortunately, when we go to play a movie, there are significant buffers (like every minute or less); we've tried several. Additionally, when I screen mirror the movie to my TV, the audio comes through fine, but the visual is black -- no movie. Hoping for an update to fix some bugs. The app LOOKS great though with loads of great movies/shows!!"
"After a bumpy start the app works very well, smooth transitions and a simple layout without any hassle of finding what to watch. The series buttons for certain franchises make it easy to quickly find something you specifically want to watch without having to do a search for one certain type of content. My only gripe in the app is that there is no ""Continue Watching"" area in the app. You have to manually search for what you were watching and then resume from there. Other than that, it's great!"
"This app is awesome, ALLL Disney's stuff is on it (all the old shows and movies!! Finally!!). But, a few minor issues: when I leave the app open, turn off my phone, and want to go back on, my finger print scanner doesn't work. I have to type in my password, don't know why but it happens. Also, it doesn't keep track of which episodes or movies you've watched, and there's no way to save items to a list. There's also no continue watching section or whatever because it doesn't keep track. AD FREE 2"
"This app is phenomenal! The only place where I think it needs work is in the watchlist. The app does remember all of the programs you have added, but I found that you can only see so many saved shows on your watchlist at a time. Those kind of features are more of a preference, but overall content and functioning of this app is wonderful."
"Awesome app! However, there is one glitch I would like to report. Many times when I pause and unpause or go back/forward 10 seconds, the pause button will change into a spinning circle (buffering) while the content continues to play. It only appears when I tap the screen, like the pause button. But, I have to leave the show/movie and click on it again for the spinning circle to go away. Just wanted to report a little bug from an overall great app! 😃"
"With the exception that my mobile hotspot doesn't seem to do too well (based on my physical location, no fault of the app) when I'm trying to stream via Chromecast or wifi to my television, I believe it is worth every penny PLUS the extra dollar they're going to tack on starting next month. I wish this had been around (with the Hulu bundle) about 3 years ago. I'd have never ever even tried Netflix. It was short lived. I take stock in this. Thank you for a great product."
"Love it. Chromebook users have to pay more attention to apps because a lot of them do not work with Chrome OS. This one works brilliantly, and as a full-time RV`er that is one more thing that eases a move, or staying so many places that I do not have cable access at. Plus, Disney has a ton of content and I watch it often. Easy to use, easy to connect with, easy to enjoy!"
EDIT: The latest updates have improved the app leaps and bounds! Good job Disney 👍👏 ----------------------------- This is why Disney should stick to media and not make software. This app is incredibly frustrating to use and has so many bugs. I try to change the subtitles and the screen simply doesn't load. Same with audio track. Disney should have left Netflix to develop the app.
"Good content. Well organized. They have a lot of HD content, original content and older classics, something for everyone. They have the ability to watch on one device and resume on another one. They have trailers for their content but not so easy to find. You have to go to the Extras menus and dig for it. I watch it on xbox, and Motorola phone, and roku and firestick, works equally well on all the platforms."
I really enjoy the selection on this app. Unfortunately I have an issue. Prior to today the app would let me download movies to my SD card. However there was always an issue of having to change the download location every time i restarted my phone bc it would always revert back to internal storage. Now it won't let me change it to external storage at all. I've tried everything. I double checked that the card was properly inserted. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. EDIT new phone. Seems fine
"It didnt work at first but now that they've gotten the bugs out, I absolutely love everything about it. I did wish that when you fast forward or rewind that it would show you the small mini pictures like on other apps so you can see what scene you're fast forwarding too. I love Disney+, the concept and the shows are great. I'm curious how many movies are on the app."
"I definitely agree with alot of the reviews. Disney really needs to impliment a feature of allowing us to start where we left off. The lack of this feature is going to get old fast. Also the selection of movies is incredible. It has all my favorites. They haven't missed one. Also it would be super awesome if we could customize our interface of the disney + app because say if its christmas time, it would be cool if we got alot of family over and we could choose different inferfaces to match vibes"
"I absolutely love this app, I only have one complaint. I use this app on my phone, just like Netflix. But unlike Netflix, Disney plus doesn't have a heads up display( basically when you press the home button and the show miniaturizes in the top corner of your screen) allowing you to view other apps and applications without the need of disrupting your show. For now Disney plus just pauses when I exit and I can only view in the app. But I would love to see them address this in the future."
"Edit: I have corrected my review as the issues have been addressed. The app will not play any videos. I can browse the menus fine but no playback. I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. On the PlayStation i can get the videos to play but they stop every 15 minutes, while the audio still plays, and i have to manually move the video forward to the next 10 second interval point. It's a temporary fix but pretty annoying to have to continuously fix something that shouldn't be an issue."
"While I do wish the library was complete with movies like Song of the South and other Disney owned, but not really Disney titles, I have throughly enjoyed the service. All of my favorite old shows and disney channel original movies are finally made available to stream, and that alone is worth the cost. The app could run a bit more smooth, though. My phone is a bit out of date (Samsung Galaxy S7), but Hulu and Netflix run much smoother on it. I'm sure it'll get better as time goes on."
"I have the android app and the FirestickTV app. Besides the occasional glitch, I found them both to be amazing! In my experience they're both easy to use, reliable, and filled with tons of things I love. As for improvements, I understand the app is new so it can't be perfect right off the bat. I suggest adding a ""continue watching"" and a ""start from beginning"" button, just to make the experience easier. Keep up the good work! <3 :)"
"Update: 9/06/2021 As of today Disney+ has been working fine on all my devices. I hardly had issues with the app and service. Only recently did I start having these issues I had stated previously. As of today though, it is working fine, on both wifi connected devices and data connected devices. UI can still be slow across all devices, but I think that's a bug that can be easily fixed over time. Other than that it's working perfectly."
"Some of these reviewers just need a new phone. Never had a problem. I have it mobile, Roku(correct spelling), Android TV, TCL TV, and on tablet. Never had any of the problems stated. I think people compare too much between services which isn't fair. Each has their own feature that is better than the other. But like I said, never had a buffer, not playing, timeout and or any of the problems these reviewers have. Most seem like it's their own phone and or data connection and not the service."
"Edit: Issue resolved. I love this app. Love the interface. Love the content. There were some initial issues with login and billing, but it has all been resolved. Can't log in on my Samsung Note 10+. I understand Disney+ requires Level 1 Wildvine security, which my device has, but when I try to log in I get error code 83. I was able to log in on my Windows laptop, but not on my phone. I will change this review when they fix this issue, but I am paying now and I want it to work on my phone."
"Great Content. Unfinished Interface. The movies and TV shows on here are amazing and I can't wait to watch/rewatch all that it has to offer! But the user interface (at least on launch day) has empty tiles for movies and TV shows that don't exist yet. They shouldn't be there yet. I expect this to be fixed soon enough, but it is misleading in the meantime."
"**Update** The upgrades made to the app make it excellent now. Nice work Disney+! Overall, great content on the app. However, navigation is somewhat cumbersome. For example, when watching a series, you must remember where you left off and manually navigate to the correct episode. The app doesn't keep track of the last episode you watched. It would be nice if there were a list on the home page showing what is currently being watched, or the next episode in the series you're watching."
"Disney+ is literally the best thing! All of the oldie shows are on here and they don't get taken off as fast as they do on Netflix. When newer shows come out with premium, you only have to pay once and then you can watch it as many times as you want. The only thing I would say kinda bugs me is sometimes the connection is super duper slow. Also when downloading movies, they take longer to download than it takes to watch the actual movie. The movies won't download without the device staying open."
"Content is phenomenal, especially with the price of entry. The interface is pretty good, like the idea of the 'Through the Decades' stuff, but finding everything that is in the app requires a ton of searching and knowing exactly what you're searching for; not everything you want Star Wars wise is immediately under the Star Wars tab, for instance. They need to flesh that out, because, really it only hurts them that just the tip of the iceberg is showing in terms of content."
"(Updated October 2020: They significantly improved the interface. This app now remembers your place in movies or shows even if you have to exit mid-watch, which it previously had issues with. They also updated the aspect ratio for certain shows that previously had part of the image cut off, namely The Simpsons. ) Functional and easy to navigate once you figure out their system (which is a bit different than the other two big streaming services) but the content is, of course, amazing!!"
"Love the app, was an original founders circle subscriber, have been anxiously awaiting the launch and it didn't disappoint. Everything runs very smooth, very clean easy to navigate interface, huge catalog. One thing I would like to see added in a future update would be a 'continue watching' section. Currently, your show will resume from where you left off, but you have to remember and search for it again. That's my only wish for the future."
"The jury is still out for me on this. However, the fact they have all the Marvel movies, all the classic Disney movies and tv shows is a huge win for me. They even allow you to download the movies like Netflix. Considering the line ups they are coming out with should make this app interesting to watch over the next year. The app runs perfect, no issue with downloading, and no issue with the price. I like how they have a monthly and a yearly option to pay. Will they surpass Netflix? We will see."
"Incredible! Cheap subscription, amazing selection of TV shows and movies, captions for everything (my hearing isn't great) and a simple app interface. Also, all of my siblings are able to use the same account, unlike other streaming services, which only let you stream on four devices. The only thing I'd ask for is that it wouldn't buffer quite so much, as it makes viewing frustratingly choppy. Otherwise, great work!"
"I had given the app 5 stars because it has lots of fun movies and shows and I've been happy with it. Now it's down to 0/1 stars because it quit working. I keep getting a dark green screen with the first 1-2 sec of dialogue, and then I get an error message. If I can't use my subscription I'd like any money I've spent for the rest of the month returned, my subscription cancelled, and an explanation as to why it suddenly doesn't work. I believe this happened since the last update you did. Working lovely again for a while now."
"I'm a huge fan of disney but the app stopped working, the first night worked great even downloading some of my favorites went fine, but the second day when trying to click on a new movie it just buffers and doesn't play anything even the show's I've already downloaded, I deleted the app and reinstalled it but I get the same thing, I want to rate it 5 stars but I can't even get them to play... I may have to unsubscribe which I really dont want to. They fixed the problem and love it!"
"The video quality is amazing and the choices are good, the only problem I am having is that when I skip an intro or I pause the video lags for about 30 seconds. It's not annoying and I k how it's a new streaming service so all the bugs are not fixed yet. But maybe look into that. Also wish there was a continously play function for phones that doesn't involve wifi or having to download."
"So far everything is going good, besides some bumps like the recent error can't connect to server or network. I recommend changing passwords on a daily or yearly bases. Keep in mind we live in a time where EVERYTHING is connected. As this was happening there have been security breaches happening as well. I'm curious if Disney+ pushed a safe guard (error) to prevent account jacking...... makes you wonder. 🤷‍♂️"
"Loving Disney plus so far! There are so many things to choose from that I dont k ow what to watch first. I would be nice if they would add a ""continue watching"" row so I don't have to keep finding shows and movies I have stared but was unable to finish in one sitting. Otherwise the app seems to work well on both my phone and fire stick!"
"First day it worked great. Now I can't watch anything at all. Keeps saying there's a problem. I'm on the Samsung Galaxy A20. EDIT: So now it works SOME of the time. I feel like every other day or so, it stops working. I'll make it to the menu, but once I click play on something it says ""oh no. Something went wrong...."" Very annoying. FINAL EDIT: Haven't checked it out in a while,but I came back to it last month and everything worked perfectly again! Love the new movies and hope to see more soon!"
"Update: Disney updated the app and now you're able to pick up where you left off. Loving the new feature! Much easier to use! It's okay....I love having access to literally the entire Disney library. It's totally worth it BUT if you're watching a series, there isnt a way to track what episode you're on or where you are in the series. If you press play, it just plays the first episode and it doesnt show which episodes have been watched already."
"I love the app, the UI is easy to use, and the display is pleasing to the eye. Love the new and old content! The only issue I have is that there doesn't seem to be an autoplay feature. I have to select each new episode rather than it going straight to the next one. Not a huge issue, definitely not enough to justify a lower rating, just a bit of a peeve."
"Edit: Disney listened to the public and added a continue watching section. With this fixed, I am happy to give a 5 star review. I am aware that many people have had issues. I must be one of the lucky ones. I have had zero streaming issues and I am a ""Founding"" member so I was there for Day 1. However, I do severely dislike the lack of a ""continue watching"" option that allows me to continue where I left off on a movie/show/series. Extremely frustrating to have to search and remember."
"Ignore any review dated 11/12 . That was launch day and some need to understand that a million if not more were also downloading and trying to stream at the same exact time. Having said that. I wish the movies and shows remember where you last left off and not start all over again when resuming a show the next day. Hopefully it will be improved. As for the library, it's incredible. I love the range of shows and movies. Excited for the future"
"Update: Felt the need to update this now that the app has been out for a while. The resume feature is here thank goodness. Never have connection issues anymore either. Original review is below. Original release day review: I know it is release day and I'm sure that's why I can't connect due to overload on servers, but I can't give it a good rating until we can connect."
"I initially was really irritated because none of the shows or movies would play on my Samsung Note 10 plus. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but still had no luck. However, after restarting my phone, the app works great and all content is smooth and looks great. Looking forward to the many hours of entertainment."
"The app is easy to use, and it is very organize! BUT I have tried various times to streaming movies, short clips, and shows and it DOES NOT work. I have also tried over wifi, my own data, downloading what I want, and even that doesn't work. Please fix!! Love the app!! (:"
"I give this app a 5 star rating on my Android phone, but a 1 star rating on my PS4. The streaming can be off at times. The video will freeze and the audio keeps rolling, or it will inexplicably fast forward all of a sudden and we'll have to rewind back to where it screwed up. It will also at times jump to the menu screen for another movie/show with the audio of what we're watching still going. I've also downloaded to the latest patch for my PS4. Fix this please, thanks."
"I downloaded the app and started my free trial with glee, then issues began to arise as of yesterday, the second day of my trial. The app completely stopped working, I had to login with data because wifi wasn't working. I am very disappointed. (3 stars) **Update (2/13/2020)** Haven't faced problems for months. I don't use it as often, but it works well with minimal buffering. Definitely improved since launch. (5 stars)"
"obv this app is awesome. it has even more disney things than I expected! Plus a lot if the features are nice and good layout. Some negatives (but not bad enough for 4 stars) is the search bar covers half of the #1 search result so you cant read the title!! v annoying. App wont load for me to get to my DOWNLOADS in no internet! no being able to open episodes list while watching. And lastly w 10sec rewind, the audio rewinds further than the picture so the screen freezes until the audio matches up"
I had trouble getting Disney+ to work at first too. I even thought about cancelling my subscription. It's so happy that I didn't! After repeated attempts to fix it I finally uninstalled then reinstalled it - no troubles since. There's always so many good things to choose from we can always find something to watch that we both agree on. Having Nat Geo included is the icing on the cake! I just can't say enough about Disney+.
Works great and I love the selection of movies and shows. And I would recommend using Chromecast if you'd like to watch on your TV. The app works well using Chromecast and it works well on my LG phone and tablet. Sorry if everyone else that is having problems using the app. 😟 I used to receive that error code months back but it seems to have resolved itself with the last app update.
"App typically runs smoothly. Hard to tell if it's my connection or server problems when it doesn't run smoothly. For whatever reason the web version is still able to work so it's either my connection or the app. Would be nice to have a queue system, especially for shorts which aren't officialy in a particular series."
"Ok, D+ did a great job of putting a lot of everything in one place. But it needs a couple tweaks: 1. It needs a Watch List so I can add a series or movie on my ""to-do"" without having to go searching for it. 2. It needs bookmarks. I'm watching a series and when I came back to it, it didn't auto play where I left off. So i had to go searching for where I was. Maybe a marker to show episodes viewed if nothing else. 3. Love The Mandalorian!!!"
"The app itself has some issues depending on what device it is used on. It can be a little slow sometimes and downloads don't always work. However, the original TV shows have become some of my favorites and the selection of classic movies can't be beat on any other streamer."
"Great Service, all these old/new shows & movies, some that I never thought I'd see again or ever! A few things that could improve, they might even be working on these as I type, but just in case... PLEASE put in keyboard commands on the desktop version. Needing to mouse over the buttons when you want to grab a screen or back up is near impossible when hitting space, an arrow or <> would work wonders. Also a next episode button even if we can't get keyboard controls. Trying to back up to the episode list can be a chore along with scrolling to the end of an episode & waiting for the last bit of credits to end."
I rarely have any buffering and when I do it's mainly because my connection is got awful. Every single show is a classic and there's every single episode. The next season prompt always shows up when the episode ends which is great especially for marvel movies whenever there is something extra at the end of the credits. Love this app can't wait to see what they add.
"App doesn't work while connected to my wifi, while literally every other streaming service works fine. It connects while I'm on LTE, but I'm not going to use up my data for this app. I will amend my rating if Disney gets this fixed. Edit: seems to be working now. I'd give it 5 stars, but the website still doesn't work on my Linux PC due to Disney's DRM. Android app works fine though. Update: it now works on Ubuntu. Thanks Disney, I will keep renewing my subscription"
"Most of what I see from the one star reviews goes like, ""Disney jumped the gun on this one like always. The app won't even load. All it says is unavailable to connect."" The app launched as a pre download and the content hit a few hours later. Looks like some people jumped the gun on their review. ""Content won't load. It's not even compatible with my tv."" It litterally just launched. It won't be compatible with everything right out the gate. Also, the player could have a bug on certain devices 🤷"
"Great content and easy to use, but some improvements could be made. Like a ""keep watching"" tab like netflix so I don't have to search for the episode or movie I was watching. It should just be one row on the home screen. Also a playlist creator would be good, like I could add certain movies or shows to a playlist, like have a Christmas movie or Halloween movie playlist. Other than that, great app and great service. :) Edit: continue watching tab sure does help a lot!"
"Have had this app for a year now. Satisfied with the content and ease of use. Only thing I notice is that it requires faster internet speeds than other streaming apps. Sometimes when internet slows down for whatever reason, the app will not open. All my other streaming services are usually not affected much. As soon as internet speed is back up it functions flawlessly though. Doesn't happen too often."
"Disney Plus is an amazing streaming app! It has so many movies and TV shows, it'll blow your mind. I just wish that it could work on my TV. It works for chrome cast but that's it. also, usually on Netflix, i can press the home button and it brings me to the home screen while watching the movie/TV show in a little box and i can drag it wherever and i just wish that Disney+ could do this. also, i wish that when u tapped on the app it brought u to the profiles page."
"Disney+ is a great app for phones, televisions and mostly for computers. On computers it takes 1 or 2 minutes to start the video, and that is fine for some people, but not really for others. But other than that this is an outstanding app. Great quality, captions are on point, and each video you can watch in over 10 languages."
"It's like my personal disney vault. I love rewatching the classic, catching up on new shows, and even diving into the originals. Also love theme park documentaries. The fact that you don't have to pay extra for HD and overall cost is cheap, this is a win for me. Now that I can link it to Google home, it's even better, though they need to update commands like previous episodes, remaining time, etc. Haven't tried the group watch it should get around to it. Overall, exceeds my expectations."
"My previous complaints with the app that the search function wasnt fully finding things it should be and that there was no ""continue watching"" section have been updated! Its really nice now to see everything properly show up when you search and to find a continue watching section of the home page of the app is really convenient. All in all it was a bit of a bumpy start but as far as i can tell you guys have worked out a lot of the bugs, good job!"
"Update 11/28/19: Devs responded after fixing everything, great job so far! 5 stars for the detail response and quick fix. Keep it up! Still got bugs to work out and features to be added. Subtitle sometimes don't show up/ can't be selected when casting to a Smart TV. Need to add a section of ""continue watching"" , where you can pick up shows that you left off instead of having to search for it , PIA."
"Revised: issues with TV connection to internet and not the app. App working well now. Also much thanks to the Disney support person. Very helpful. Having issues for about a week or two - cannot get Disney+ to load onto our TV - working fine on our phones. Very frustrating. Have uninstalled/reinstalled, cleared data/cache, WiFi working OK Very frustrated."
So far so good! been using it for a month and havent had a single problem. The only thing I would like is for the menu to auto rotate once it opens. Right now it wont go into full screen until you choose something to watch. But otherwise u have to search in picture mode rather than in landscape mode.
"I am halfway through the Lady and the Tramp as my first movie off Disney plus. I'm very impressed and it exceeds my expectations. I love the way they organized it in many different categories to make it easy to find movies and shows. Just wow! Also seeing old shows brought back many memories when I was a child! Thank you, Disney!"
Netflix will be knocked off it's streaming throne. Absolutely amazing. I bought the premium pack before my week trial was even over. So many movies and shows. The Mandalorian being one of them. I am dying for new episodes and watch the previous one three times. App needs a little work. Doesn't save your place on the movie you are watching so you can return to it but I know that fix is coming. I know when movie licenses expire with Netflix they will appear here.
"Great way to watch movie. Disney is full of classics and makes great originals. Its amazing you can watch disney, pixar, marvel, national geographic, and some fox. Only 1 problem, sometimes the film will freeze and the audio will keep playing. I rewind 10 seconds and it fixes itself. No big problem, and definitely not a deal breaker. I really recommend downloading this app and at least use the free trial. My family has replaced Netflix and hulu with disney+"
"Disney+ is excellent! So much variety even beyond classical ""Disney"" programming. My only beef, and I talked to others about this and we all agreed, is that it buffers a lot more than other streaming services. I wonder if this is only because the app is new and there are kinks to be worked out, or because there are so many people using it. Regardless, I give the app 4 3/4 stars. Some occasional buffering is well worth the price to pay for such an impressive variety of quality content."
"Disney+, as a whole, is pretty awesome. Lots of great movies, shows, and shorts (I watched Chef Donald yesterday). It has everything I was expecting and then some. I'm finally catching up on movies I had not seen or ones I haven't seen in YEARS. Only gripe I have, however, is there's no ""Continue Watching"" feature within the app. It saves your position but you have to remember what episode you left off on. UPDATE: Disney finally added a continue option, makes it a lot easier for shows"
Love this service! Even though there's several big movies and shows missing this is still a solid start. I like that they tell you straight up when they will be available. It's understandable that some movies and shows might not be worth the contract buyout to put on their service right away. Mandalorian was the main reason I got this service and it's worth the price just for that show. Disney has shown they listen to consumers and our doing great in fixing any and all issues that come up.
"I love the concept, and it works will on my roku ultra on my TV, but the phone app not so much. I log in just fine, edit profiles and view the selections fine, but can't play anything and my watch list selection don't save. I'm using a Samsung Note 10+ UPDATE: After rebooting my phone, the app works perfectly :-)"
"This app works amazing. Decent video quality with minimal buffering, even on less than reliable wifi or mobile connection. Easy to navigate. Lots of great recent and older titles. And the pricing is pretty good, as well. exclusive shows are, for the most part, theatrical quality and may even be better in some cases. Notifications are pretty muted compared to some apps. Very good for staying entertained while traveling."
"I love this app! It is great for everytime I feel like watching a movie but not going to turn on the TV, it's great! They have so many of the Og movies and even Disneys new ones! They don't have all the movies though... Disney has to wait intel their partnership with other streaming services end. Overall, a great app! And really good cost for the monthly price!"
I think Disney Plus is great. Just with the amount of content makes it a worthwhile product. The app is simple to use and easy to navigate. I use the app on my android phone and Roku device. In my case there is minimum buffering and rarely crashes due to buffering. The price is very affordable compared to what you get in return.
"Disney+ please fix it to where i can cast it to Chromecast. After you fix this ill change my rating you have my word. Other than that everything is wonderful. I look forward to seeing the advancements you make to this app, but the main concern for me is the Chromecast ability not there. Good luck to your team and I wish you best. As soon as that issue is fixed and it works. I will change it. (update) theu have fixed it. 5stars to you.!!!"
So I've been tinkering with the app all day. Literally. It's pretty easy to navigate and add different users. the interface is almost the same as Netflix however I prefer Disney's as it runs a lot smoother. And I like that on my Xbox one I can use the thumb sticks to forward and rewind. this app is amazing what more could you ask for it has all the Disney classics that you knew and grew up with. Especially if your kid of the late 80s and 90s early 90s that is. It's an amazing app.
"Damn, can't find a SINGLE bad thing about it. Lol. I've been able to download, watch numerous different movies and series without a single problem, EVER. The only slight issue, which isn't limited to just this app, is lack of being able to make a Playlist and watch a few movies without having to click on it individually. But that's a minor thing"
"Everyone always expects a first day glitch when there's something popular first releases. After a few hours it was working perfectly. After learning of the bundle with Hulu & ESPN was only $12.99 a month, we decided to cancel our Netflix. For those who are wondering about the bundle deal, click on your profile in the app and then click on account it will allow you to upgrade to the bundle. Worth every penny!"
"Definitely needs a ""currently watching"" function so that you can resume watching something from the front page. Also needs to remember your place while watching a show so that when you come back to it you don't have to remember the exact season and episode. Watchlist should be on the front page and not a list you get to through your profile. A little buggy but not bad since it's been less than a month since released. I do like how it tells you when something will be available."
"Tons of content, good app experience, love the kids mode! I actually like how the content is broken down by brand. My one complaint is the lack of some expected content, like Disney Jr shows are present, but newer seasons or series are missing forcing me to use the Disney Now app. I'd much rather have one app for everything! Also where is the music section??? Would be awesome to use this for playlists for the Disney catalog!"
"Everyone is expecting all these different features to be on here. Keep in mind this is the first streaming service for Disney. So eventually they will be making changes and adding features. What I mean is being able to see where you left off, recent history of shows, you know features that are on Netflix and Hulu. But still, this is a phenomenal service and gives us nostalgia for a great price."
"I have been trying to watch Disney+ for the past 3 days, and it continuously states that there is a problem connecting to the servers. I have tried for several hours three times a day at different times, but I get no improvements. It is not my internet connection because it works for everything else. I was only able to get on and stream videos once since I downloaded the app. Edit: The app finally started working, and I have spent countless hours watching it!"
"*Update: Seems to be working fine now! Ending my subscription didn’t last long at all because my family loves Disney movies, so thankful I can watch it without constantly waiting to load. Thanks! I love the selection of movies. The app works great on my phone. But I can never cast it to my TV without it constantly stopping to reload. I don't have this problem with other apps, so I know it isn't my TV or my WiFi connection. I'm currently streaming a Disney movie off of YouTube instead of Disney+ because YouTube will actually play the movie all the way through without stopping every 45 seconds to load. My 2 year old doesn't really have the patience for that. Hope it will be fixed soon."
It started a little laggy. But in less then a day most of the bugs I found were fixed. Love what they are doing with the app. Only issue I have is of you exit from a show it doesn't start from where you left off. It also doesn't track where you are in shows. I feel strongly like these problems will be fixed soon.
"App is simple and very easy to use. Library of content is massive. Well worth the $$ compared to Netflix, Amazon, etc. I would like to see a ""Continue Watching"" tab on the app (similar to Netflix's interface) when viewing is interrupted instead of having to search and find the item."
I love it. It has every Disney movie I can think of and more. But what's the point in adding other profiles if they can't watch the movies? I added my girlfriend on mine so she can watch movies on her own account without messing mine up and it didn't give her the option to watch the movie she wanted. But when she clicked into my profile and refreshed the page it showed the play button. Maybe it's just a bug? But I figured I'd bring it to someone's attention.
I honestly love it. You can download movies and shows for later and it's nice rewatching old stuff and the new things. Plus I don't have to rent a DVD or anything just to watch something. Or pay to watch older movies even with the subscription. I've always disliked. I truly love the interface and options. You can get the bundle with Hulu and ESPN. I don't have that I just bought the year subscription for Disney+. Either way I've never been more happier with an internet movie service. Thank you!
"*Edit, it now plays your recently played. I really don't have any complaints. I love the movie choices and the app works well on my fire stick and phone. It's a good app, but it's a bit annoying that there's no option for recently played. If you're watching something you have to search through again then find the season and find the episode. Besides that, this is great! The rating will go up once recently played is added. Such a small thing that every other streaming app has!"
"Great looking app, can't wait to use it to its full extent. However, it looks like the app is having trouble loading anything while I'm on WiFi and is having no issues while I'm on LTE data. I ran a speedtest with both data methods and the upload and download on WiFi is much higher than LTE. I don't know how much I'll use it on LTE if that keeps going."
"I had Disney+ and Hulu. We wanted to add ESPN+, but was hesitant because it was a nightmare to cancel it the last time we had it. I called customer service with Disney+ to get the bundle package. The guy I talked to was very helpful. He walked me through setting everything back up on all my devices and making sure everything was working properly. The cost of the bundle deal is great......especially since it is NHL season and college basketball is around the corner."
"Look, the price is fantastic, and the content is unbelievably high quality. Disney, while the dominant force in the media industry, has managed to create an intuitive app that works well, and is filled with great content. Marvel, Star Wars, and, well that's why I use the app. But, it's worth the price if they keep releasing good content. And, while sometimes their shows are just good, some are fantastic or amazingly great! Even their worst content is better than most other services best stuff."
"Not bad. It's really nice, although it still has a few bugs. When I go to watch episodes that are downloaded, it freezes and I have to rewind and watch part of the episode again. Additionally, the login screen, while being user friendly, tends to lack a certain... uumph?... with that said, better than any other streaming service out there by far! Huge selection of movies and more. Nice app, great idea."
"So far so good! There have been a few titles that when selected don't show the ""play"" button but after a while the play button showed up. Casting a show to my TV is just as easy as any other service out there. I found myself not sure of what to look up since the content is so massive. 5/5 for now and I don't see that changing. I did find one title, Christopher Robin, that was locked up by a contract with someone else so it won't hit Disney+ until Sept 5 2020 but so far that's been the only one."
"The app is great, regardless of what some say, it opens the first time, plays the movies and shows in great quality with no buffering. If you're reading a bad review on this it is probably someone who cannot work a phone or has a phone pre 2010 and needs an upgrade bad. Disney plus is the streaming app I have been waiting for, the content is everything I could have dreamed of."
all my favorite action movies and hero movies on one app. plus they even put the movies in order for you. all the marvel movies all in order along with their own sections. also if you don't want your children to watch certain ratings you can create your own profile with a pin. also behind the scenes movies and so much more. this app is a amazing
"Finally got Netflix again, cause there's been a lot of stuff on here I've been wanting to watch. Also, I forgot that there are now exclusive games with it, so that makes it even better. There's some really good ones! One thing I noticed, though, is on the ""More details"" section for games on the Netflix app, most of them say no controller support, even if the game does have it. For example, Dust and Neon has full controller support, but it says no for the details in the app."
"Netflix is an amazing app! It has many differnent shows and series. Though, the only change I would do with it, is add more seasons of different things, like I was watching one piece and it only goes up to a certain amount of episodes, so I had to change to a different app. Other than this, this app is very very good and underrated, and I 100% think that it would be worth the try to get it and just enjoy watching your favorite and even new shows you want to try, it also has a huge selection."
"i absolutely love the netflix app above all other streaming services. i have ever had any issues with any updates, or different versions, and i've installed and updated repeatedly over the years on multiple types of devices, including android, iOS, Chromebook, Motorolla, etc, and still have yet to experience any problems whatsoever, so i thought that some praise was in order.."
"One of the best things about life is Netflix, period. Remember when they sent them to you in CD form? Back in the day, that was. It was wonderful. Now you get it streaming, and for your phone, you can download some episodes to watch during your wait for an appointment or something. There's always /something/ to watch, and when my internet is slow and lagging, I can usually still play Netflix on just a chromebook. It works."
"Netflix has a wide selection of movies, tv shows, and short series in many different genres and from various countries. I love the new and old films available on this app. Plus, Netflix makes their own great films. My favorite part is that you pay a monthly subscription and that's it; no in-app sales and no advertisements. Nice and simple, no chance for accidental subscriptions, and no extra costs. Hope they keep it this way. Thanks Netflix for this user friendly, well-organized streaming app."
"I'm improving my rating back to 5 stars because they fixed the issue I had. The app wouldn't show audio for any of the shows no matter what I did. I turned off anything that could be blocking the audio, and it still didn't work. Either way, I'm glad it works now so I can finish the series (plural) I like. The app makes me retry once everytime I open it, but it doesn't affect me so I'm fine with it. Thanks for making this app. Also, why do series get removed? I heard it's copyright reasons. Bye!"
"This is basically the only app I have been using since I had gotten my new Chromebook, and I never really appreciated Netflix. However, I got to say, this is some top tier stuff. (My first two movies on here were ""Addams Family Values"" and ""The Sea Beast"", and master pieces honestly. But back to the review). I can never go wrong with Netflix, and the only real ""problem"" is them not having something that I'd like to watch. But that isn't really their fault, and I definately advise this app."
"Netflix is by far the most easy to use of the streaming services. They also have a great selection of Netflix originals. I especially love the movies: Adam Project, Living with Yourself, Don't Look Up, The Fundamentals of Caring, Rescued by Ruby, To the Bone. The only complaint I have is that I wish you'd give all of your TV shows at least 2 seasons to catch on. It'll mean you miss the Fireflys of 2023. Shows that have a cult following that take more than 1 season to really catch on."
"I have 2 wishes about this app. That I could have an easier way to add/delete multiple shows to my list and that it would warn you with alerts like when a new one is comes, when one on your list is ending. Other than that, its great! Love it! Oh, and some of the original shows, I wish they would bring back. They promised more seasons, but then cut them. Irritating. You get into a show and then, it gets axed. We want NF to be better than network TV! This is your chance! Or mbe, a mini movie!"
"Addicted! This is by far the most used app on our tablets, we never have issues watching and the original content is always great! Every day we find a new movie at random and 9 out of 10 it's engaging and leaves us talking about what just happened. Truly enjoy Netflix, mostly for the content that we can't find anywhere else. Kudos to the creators, writers, producers and actors! Keep up the amazing work. I can't wait to see what we pick tonight"
Today I was looking at Hulu  and all the complaints about ads and service. No wonder Netflix has a much better rating then Hulu. I really have had no problems with Netlfix and also can download many movies and TV series to my tablet to take on the road and watch off-line. So it does not bother me to pay an extra dollar for their service. Just keep the content up and all is fine. Maybe a few more Classic Movies to the list would be great.
"Obviously this is the standard bearer for streaming services, and with reason. While there might be a few good shows here and there on other apps/networks, Netflix broke the mold for developing, producing, and streaming shows. There are some down sides, such as not being the most clear menu to navigate, dropping shows very, very quickly, no live news shows,, etc. But it's awesome."
"My Netflix account is down right now because I owe a payment, but this app is wonderful. So many movies and series to watch and the Netflix original series are wonderful. Great app I highly recommend it. Only negative thing is the price keeps going up. And I don't think u should have to pay extra for more devices. When I do have my Netflix going not all my kids can watch at same time on different device. So I usually have to pay extra so everyone can watch at same time if they decide to."
"Netflix is my go-to for web-based movies and documentaries. The selection available is superb, I rarely have trouble finding programs that interest me, and I really like the combination of education and entertainment content offered. I also really enjoy the different platforms that Netflix provides its' content on. Wether im at home, or visiting family, the ease of access is second-best to none."
"It's great, but I have a slight issue. On my phone, Saumsung Galaxy S8+, it won't let me fast forward or go backwards without logging me out so I have to log back in. I've never had this issue before besides recently. I tried watching Quantico and when I went to go backwards, it was taking too long to load and just would not let me watch it. So I went onto a different show and as I tried going forwards, it logged me out. If you could fix this issue, it would be great! Already tried uninstalling and turning off my phone."
Thank you so much for the skip intro & next episode buttons! I also love a lot of the new content (original and other wise). I've used several of the streaming apps and I appreciate the effort you put into the user interface and human factors. I love stories with good plot lines and character development. I don't like pointless torture or gore scenes.
Originals are good. Picture & Sound are good. But previews of series you are already watching is annoying. They cover half the screen which makes it difficult to read through series episodes. If it's on our list we don't need the aggravation of previews. Plus it is basically an ad. I don't pay for ads. Please add a close option on the app. Thank you.
"Netflix on its own is doing great, but i think it should try and get more new movies. People expect to see the movies they love intead of ""Yeah this looks like a good show so ill try it out."" Netflix should be full of inspirational movies and not rated R and MA, i mean yeah sure some people are into that stuff, but try and get the more cleaner version for the rest of us. And one last thing, when on some shows it says skip intro and skip to the next episode, on the home screen dont have it say ""Continue wacthing"" because then it gets in the way and you cant really focus on your show if its always in the way. I like to organize and watch shows at a time but if it tells me skip an intro to get the story then im doing it. I would love for netflix to be a bigger hit after people read this review. Thank you for reading this!"
"Really good! There's tons of movies and shows to browse, and even interactive movies. It's very nice, the only problem is many shows & movies are getting removed. Such as, Coraline, Goosebumps, etc... This may be because of copyright or so, but it's very upsetting. But on the bright side there are many originals. Raising Dion, etc... Overall a great app!"
I have have used Netflix since their mail DVD days and have never looked back since. Always impressive formats and user friendly design. keep it up and please keep the price reasonable. If price was slightly higher I may opt for a competitor. Only downside is sometimes shows contract ended and I wasn't aware and couldn't finish the last episode of a series. Not everything makes it on.
"It is nice being able to watch movies and TV episodes provided on Netflix without there being major buffering or advertisements before, after or surfing the shows. They also have a feature where you can download content for offline viewing for trips or places that don't have wifi. The UI ( user interface aka menus) are easy to use and do not make it hard to search for what is wanted."
"The app is great, it's very functional. I've never had a problem with the Netflix app, EXCEPT for when I'm watching an episode and leave the app two Netflix apps pop up and I'm never sure which one to open and most of the time I'll be watching an episode leave the app and when I come back to it seconds later it throws me back 3 episodes right in the middle. It has its bugs but for the most part it's fine and a pretty good app"
"I've always loved Netflix. Still do. The only things that suck are that the 'recommended for you' is 90% garbage that I'd never watch and I wish there was a function to turn on/off movies etc in different languages.. a movie will sound great then I see it's not in English and I'm disappointed, and recently I've been bombarded with foreign movies. Just wish there was a feature to not see these as options when browsing."
"Normally my experiences with Netflix are fantabulous. But since the update, when it prompts me to skip recap or intro, I click skip and it doesn't do anything. I JUST bought this phone! Also, I've tried COUNTLESS times to cast Netflix on my VIZIO TV, and I ALWAYS get the same error message ""unknown error, try again later, etc"". I'd REEEALLY appreciate being able to use the functions that claim to be available. Thank you."
"Just read another review from someone named Mark. The attitude of some people is perfection. Netflix is quite an amazing deal, constantly adding new titles, large variety of choices including multiple international programs. The interface is by far the best from the many streaming apps I've tried. The ability to adjust speed another huge plus (watch most stuff 1.25x). In comparison Disney+ has an abysmal catalog and I already regret paying for a full year. Netflix is the best, and will remain so"
"Netflix is affordable, w/ a decent range of shows/movies/documentaries to watch whenever u want. If there's anything u want to watch, but u know u're gonna be in an area w/o internet connection u have the option to download the show so it's viewable literally wherever/whenever. With just one account u can login on multiple devices @ the same time! In my opinion, 1 like bummer is that there's some current mainstream TV shows & ""recently released"" movies that aren't available that I'd like to see."
"I've been a loyal Netflix customer since it was a snail mail service. I used to love going through my queue and trying to figure out what movies to ask for next. I'm consistently impressed with the quality of the production of Netflix only programming, just wish there was more outside IP. More Disney would be nice as well. All in all, great service, and a wonderful array of information and entertainment, right at your fingertips. It's even been responsible for coining a new phrase ."
"Decen, but they really need to make the inputs through the TV controller lot less clunky and unforgiving. For example you have to press the back button to skip back 10 seconds but then you have to wait like another 3 seconds to do it again. Make it user friendly and even better than we expect it to be please. I do like how simple the app is though as of now"
"Works well. I haven't had any app issues. Aside from watching it on my smaller phone screen, it's basically like using Netflix on a laptop, but well designed for my phone layout. LOVE that I can download shows or movies to watch offline, and that it'll tell me if my download has expired, but won't delete it from my downloads list (which means I can quickly redownload it without having to find the movie or episode again). No complaints so far!"
"I enjoy watching all the variety of shows Netflix has. I would like to send a suggestion in the app: give an option to clear watched episodes. I rewatch series, but all the episodes I watched previously are still shown as watched. It gets confusing if I look at the episodes and more and can't remember where I was. This usually happens when i ""close all tabs"" on my phone while watching netflix. If i close out the video box and go into netflix again, it will start me at an earlier episode or spot"
"I simply love Netflix. I can't afford DirecTV or other TV services like that but for $17.99 a month I get so many movies and series to watch that I can't watch them all and I have them on 4 different devices so anytime I have to wait somewhere, like I am right now, sitting in a bar in Atlanta waiting on a Doordash order, I can catch a few minutes of a favorite show. The only thing I don't like is that when I watch it on my computer, it has to stop & buffer pretty often and that's annoying."
"It's great to have the option to watch a choice of movies right on your phone or stream. I wish the app allowed forward and rewind of the video using drag option. Also, it doesn't stream sometimes, citing some bandwidth statement..it disappears before I could read and understand! Tried the same movie on Amazon and it allowed me to stream!"
"As far as streaming app goes, Netflix is head and shoulders above everyone else as far is the user experience goes. The app loads fast on all devices I own including my Sony smart TV and streams flawlessly for most part. The interface is nice and clean and very easy to navigate. The other streaming services still have a lot of catching up to do in this area!"
"I have been a member of Netflix for 10+ years, and with that said i have just about ever streaming service thats available and this is my fav. So I have to say one of my ""now"" favorite features about Netflix is that they don't show you a ton a shows or movies that you HAVE to have a premium subscription to watch, or this ""add on"" and that ""add on"". Yes it does cost a little more but in the end the frustration is less and the $ in the same if not less. Keep it up Netflix!"
"Great app, I've never had a bug occur in the 3+ years I've had it; however, it is annoying that to change the subtitles I had to look up a support article to figure that out, I was really sick of white on white subtitles. Adding that to settings in the app would be a HUGE lifesaver for many people. Lastly, I would like to see a little less Netflix content and more content from stuff like before Netflix started doing all their originals, but overall the Netflix app and service are great!"
"I love Netflix. I do not have a TV, Computer, WiFi or Stereo. I grew up without them. Plus everything is so expensive. I use my cellphone for everything. It's so much cheaper. I never have problems with Netflix. I don't mind the ads because if you watch TV from my understanding they are a lot longer. I have even ordered stuff from the ads. It's cheap (I pay $9.99 a month I can put up with ads). Netflix is really good at keeping up with the latest season on their series 🥰🥰"
I can actually afford some entertainment which is Netflix. Netflix makes it so easy to enjoy because when you have to get up and do something you can pause it when you want to see it again you just rewind.. there's no schedule . I have been with Netflix quite a few years and I still love them.. you just can't beat entertainment for the price.. when I have a question and need to call them they're helpful they're nice... I would recommend them to everyone.
"Love this app. I have several others I like, but Netflix is the best. It remembers where you left last watched. There are tiny captions that say film or series when scrolling thru a series of offers so you do not waste time, just move to the choice that meets current need. AND Netflix does not kill my battery. Of course the variety is great. I really like that there are notifications that alert you the series you have started if leaving soon."
"We had to get rid of Netflix because of past issues (cough cough Cuties), but that still dosent excuse the fact that Netflix is actually good. If you don't wanna watcha long intro, you can skip it. If you don't like the credits, you can skip those, too. Some of the movies could be better, but other than that it's a good streaming service and I highly recommend it to you."
"Samsung S10+ App doesn't work and keeps giving me a device error code. I've tried multimedia advices found online, but none of them have worked. I guess I'll have to unscribe. 😞 UPDATE: They finally fixed whatever the problem is and I'm so happy that I can watch from my phone again! Also, I'm even happier because I saw the news layout. When I selected movies, I found a Zombie category! I'm so happy now!!!"
"I think Netflix should allow paying customers to receive their favorite TV shows before they air on cable TV. Also, movies that are playing in theaters, I think we should be allowed to watch new movies on Netflix a week after the theaters showing them . I think Netflix should have an option that allows you to choose to pay extra monthly 4 all the shows from Hulu, Stars, HBO, AMC and Etc. in one big package instead of having to pay individually for every one of them. Other than that, I am Happy!"
"I've been using Netflix for about 3-4yrs and I love it. Although not all the latest movies are available on here, there are still plenty of other movies, tv shows and other interests that is tailored to ur personal viewing. Tbh I don't even feel like I'm missing out on the experience with all the other app subscriptions for watching movies or tv programs."
"Addicted to Netflix! I became disabled about 3 years ago and this was the first streaming channel I decided to check out. There is a wide variety and the monthly cost of $8.99 is so reasonable! I love how easy it is to find something to watch, as well as get reminders on a future show coming up. I can easily continue watching a program while in another app and all I need to do is allow it in my settings. This makes it extremely versatile."
"LOVE it! Being on a very limited budget, and having watched almost all the decent dvds from the library, I decided to give Netflix a try. That was almost 2 years ago. Luckily I started my subscription before the latest two price increases! I've never had any problems - aside from being impatient for new seasons of shows to begin (Heartland, Nurse Jackie, Orange is the New Black & The Ranch are some of my absolute favorites 🤜🏻💥). Keep up the great work!"
"It has some great movies and TV shows! Great for watching with or without kiddos around. Netflixx has some great varities. It also has blocks so you can choose or not choose what your children should be watching. When making profiles, you can choose the ""kids"" option if it is for younger children who you would like to limit their watching guidelines. You can also make up to 5 profiles which is very helpful for all sorts of families or households! I highly reccomend Netflix for everyone! :)"
"I have been a Netflix subscriber since it's infancy with the disc in the mail program which was super cool. Now i only stream at HD level and will use 4K once i have the equipment for it. Best feature: content. Disney+ was supposed to kill Netflix, in a galaxy far, far away! Netflix has sooooo much more content! The number of original programs is huge. I will likely never discard my subscription as long as they keep the movies coming. Wish list: an easier way to organize shows you want to watch"
"Netflix original content is improving. Thought provoking material is hard to find, though (unlike Prime Video). However, Netflix fully supports full-screen playback with NO BLACK BARS on hole-punch and notch displays on android. You'd think this would be normal, sadly with android it is not. Netflix is one of the only apps on android to fully support display cutouts in landscape orientations. MAJOR props to Netflix for taking the time to properly code their app. Others take note."
"5 years w Netflix and never looked back. I have had them all at one time or another. Netflix has always been the core of my steaming Media and never disappoint. They have more great content then you have time for. Always new movies, original content, documentaries, specials, and not to mention the best standup comedy line up out there. Oh yea, they are also a real true no ads streaming service. W/ Hulu I had the top package(ad free) and still watched blocks of commercials every 8 to 10 min."
"*THANK YOU FOR FIXING THIS* I would normally say this is the greatest streaming app, but since the latest update, I am so annoyed, I don't even want to watch anything on it. I HATE that the subtitles always are on unless you turn them off at the start of everything you watch. Secondly, the app will randomly stop playing what I'm watching. This will happen multiple times. THEN I also have to turn off the subtitles AGAIN after I restart the playback."
I I love this app. it's very easy to use and update. I also get notifications on things that I like based on my viewing habits. very easy to project images two other screens as well or sign in from different devices. well worth the money the only movie streaming app you will need. they also have excellent original programming for reasonable rate.
"I love the app but I was wondering if you guys could look into giving us the option to mark episodes as watched. I sometimes watch Netflix with other people then when I continue on my account I have to click each episode and skip to the end to have it marked as watch. It would be great if you did this with not only the app on here but with the entire thing on any platform (smart TV, game consoles, computers etc.)"
"This app is amazing. I have no issues with its function or its quality. Not a fan of the app icon though. It's quite bold and stark in its color. I've found that no matter what kind of phone or background you have on your screen, it will stand out like a sore thumb...and not in a good way. An update on imagery might show customers Netflix is not just entertaining but also easy on the eyes"
"I have always enjoyed the movies from Netflix, as I've had them since 2013, and I've ALWSYS been satisfied. I enjoy Netflix, because there are so many choices, in what you want to watch, drama, comedy, Syfy, it doesn't matter, never a full day, with Netflix. The only thing I don't like, is the going up of prices,as when I first became a NETFLIX customer, I remember it was only 7.99 a month, now, for the same thing, it's 16.00 a month, that's a increase of 8.00, that's DOUBLE. The cost of living."
"Excellent viewing experience. Everything works properly and there are NO ADS!!! Literally, the only streaming service that you don't have to pay extra for no ads or to get all the content. Everything is included in one price and it's only 5 bucks with T-mobile."
"You can change the language of the app and it's nice, language of the audio tends to vary a bit some are limited others have a lot, anime options are great however they could add the rest of the seasons. If they could put a warning instead of suddenly removing things would be amazing"
"This streaming app is good and has all the good and the bad movies in it and all, but someone said that the translation for movies that aren't in english originally is wrong? If it is, can you try and fix it? That's the only issue I have with this app, all the other features are good."
Netflix team- Humble Request - Don't bring in advertisements to bring in more revenue. Maintain the same standard and cost if possible without irritating ads. Just improve and focus only on content. Need not focus too much on Indian languages though good films can be motivated. Irrespective of language maintain content quality. Loyal and genuine subscribers must be enough.
I've loved Netflix since I was a kid but I remember there was a game show host thing that would help you pick a movie on the ps3 version of Netflix. I would absolutely love to see that again. It would make the experience much more enjoyable and fun.
"Ohhhh yeah 😎 I love this app. NO ADDS, NO GLICHING, and if you have no wifi you can download videos to wach! I learn stuff on it to! I also love how some shows you choose what they do! (Not all but some!) The only thing you need to add it..... MORE VIDEOS! I mean, I know you have many already. But I love them so much! (Here's a idea for a movie or show I would like to see: a show with real barbie doll family life. But just a idea if you need it) anyway I love this channel!"
"Netflix has always been my go-to choice for movies and shows it doesn't have ads, and there are so many features, and on mobile, it even has games. Honestly, I rate Netflix 9/10"
"At a hotel, tv has Netflix app. Click log in, gives me a QR code on screen. I scan it with my phone, which pops up Netflix app, asking if the device is alright to add to my account. I click yes, annnnd done. It's working. What."
my experiance was good except i had a hard time choosing shows that i liked and that were my style i know that not everyone had this problem! Overall i pretty much liked it. but my kids also couldet find shows that they liked my 8 year old aubrynn has her hair dyed pink and loved the gymnastics shows and wished there were more that she like!
"Love netflix!!! It's especially good on your phone because when you have no wifi or service, there is the option to download movies or episodes to seasons which is so handy. So far that I've had it, there hasn't been anything bad that's affected my time using it. :)"
"I don't have much to say but i really love this app. It won't give you every show/ movie/ film/ clip you're looking for but it certainly usually gives enough. I have Netflix on my TV ( of course ), my phone, my laptop, and my tablet. it has some of the newest movies and some oldies. i really reccomend this fr when ypure bored and want to watch some horror, something to watch with your family, or partner/friend. One suggestion is to add more horror movies. Thats all thx for reading."
"I have using this app for over a year, and I stopped using for a while, when the UI was glitchy and now its good, except you keep adding stuff no one needs; like the Fast Laughs tab. Tiktok sucks enough, we don't need two of them. Also, if you guys give like a popup in-app if any of the titles in 'My List' is leaving Netflix so we could get a heads up , that would be great. Edit: thanks for giving me updates now. Giving 5 stars."
"Netflix provides thousands of movies of EVERY genre for anyone of any age to enjoy free of commercials. I don't watch local TV anymore. I watch entire TV seasons, movies, Netflix specials, documentaries and much more right here. Thank you, for fulfilling my entertainment needs at home."
"I am extremely satisfied with the Netflix app. It provides me with a vast selection of movies and TV shows, and the streaming quality is always excellent. The app is user-friendly, and I love the convenience of being able to access it on my phone or tablet whenever I want. However, I do have one suggestion for improvement. It would be great if Netflix could allow users to select more than two subtitle languages. As someone who enjoys watching foreign movies and TV shows, having more subtitle op"
"It's completely Amazing. I love the app and I always binge watch in there. But I wish that Netflix had an option where two or more people could watch together and interact at the same time. You know, like, I and my friend are watching the same show at the same time! As if I invite her to watch it with me and then we can chat/talk while watching it would be amazing update and whole new experience for everyone out there! I'm sure you guys will kill it if there was such an option.❤️,🖤."
"Update: UI has been fixed, which makes a huge difference! Your catalogue is great but this latest UI is terrible. In a busy day, if I can spare time to reward myself watching something, I prefer to be able to quickly look at a range of options rather than doom-scrolling through the few titles shown to me one at a time. That feeling of wasting time immediately sends me to look at the apps of your competitors."
Fantastic app... love the shows and I try to watch all... just wish close to the top the ending soon section with stuff soon to be coming off was there and the option to click shows that you've watched if you want them to disappear I know some are worth watching again that's why I said an option to take them off
Yes Netflix is expensive as compared to other ott streaming platform but the quality and variety of which Netflix provides in term of movies and series is amazing. After experiencing other streaming platform which revolve around those Marvel movies only. I have also taken the subscription of those but revoked that after using it just for 3 hrs only and understood that there is no worthy content. So keep up the good work Netflix 💯 good job you are doing.
"Highly recommended,,,and they are keeping a standard for everything,, the Outlook, interface Even the contents This was my feedback on 2020. From last few weeks i was thinking to change the plan i currently using,, and i cant see such option anywhere they says,, neither i can't contact you nor call you,,"
I started watching Breaking Bad and this spinoff of Better Call Saul. I have watched it for 6 seasons now. I have a lot of tv shows and movies that keep me entertained. My only complaint is when certain things are permanently removed.
23 has seen the haters come back to attack Netflix unfairly in my opinion. I have no other TV and use Netflix as my only so and I'm very happy with it. Their own stuff is fantastic and the library of stuff is great. The app works perfectly for me and while I don't like the rise in cost it's good value for money in my opinion. I'm a very happy customer!
"This app is fantastic it doesn't give me any problems , the experience is 100/100 . There is no ads that interrupt my viewing , I am actually getting my money's worth but I do have one tiny problem , when viewing a show some of them do not have another language option ."
"I love this app there is this one season called outerbanks and I wish that they could keep it alive and out there on Netflix please because I want to watch it over and over again it was perfect, amazing, and brilliant I bet I could keep saying this stuff but just tell the people who made it to keep up the good work it's a really amazing season Im just so mind blown and btw can u pls tell them my message and Netflix has a whole tons of shows that's so good but thank y'all for keeping up the good"
"I had given this app a 1star review months ago based on the simple fact that my phone was messed up, which caused the Netflix app to work upon opening it. The app now works again, and to top it off, Netflix has a ton of new titles that I have been wanting to watch!"
"Seems like there is a bug after update i am not able to watch anything from my mobile and niw even netflix home page is not loading, at first i thought it's because of my network but it's not that. The application is crashing."
"Excellent always new movies or tv shows unlike other services that seem to seldom come out with new material,when they do it might be one movie or tv show. Then for months same old material. Please Netflix keep up the great work!!"
"While it might be confusing to newbies, I've been installing and using digital devices since 1980. If you read the instructions and take your time, it's easy."
it's one of the best streaming services if not the best the interface is amazing on every platform and the movies and the tv shows is good too but i wish they stop deleting some of the tv shows overall is good
"I am using Netflix subscription about 3 years.. My suggestion is that, Netflix subtitles translation languages futures may please be added in Netflix software app. Regards.."
I belive netflix is a good app to use because they make deals and let you the netflix even though you didnt pay because they change movie shows kids accounts adult accounts but their only 5 acconts for anyone it can be an kid accounts anyone u have to pick it on a phone to put your number in to have offical Netflix account and if you speak english engsola french all types of languages.Also their are no ads to disrup your favorite movie tv show and when u pay the first time you u dont have to pay
This is so organised and the search bar is very fast and it almost every movie and shows.I think Netflix is the best entertainment platform.
"Netflix is just wow when it comes to TV shows like Designated Survivor, The Flash, Supergirl, Black lightning ⚡, Arrow, Dc's Legends of tomorrow, Teen wolf, Lucifer,... , Now I'm addicted to Korean tv shows. Like Taxi driver, Vagabond, the K2...All of them are equipped with amazing English subtitles."
"Exllenlent pic quality more than cartoons,adventures,Action all varietys movies and shows also there.one recharge three months seeing. Only wifi at full data at working all lauguages showing there."
Still the Best. Many are trying but none can beat the original. Still the best after all these years. Please keep releasing the hits. A+++++ 👍🏾💯
"Just updated but disappointed with some of programs , series, movies, Last year repeated or no new updated series. There is some you watch over again , some a to much the same story all on love , where it over done. Not girl meets boor girl mets girl, boy meets boy. But More Mysteries Series that sit sit on edge of your sit waiting. To who done it. But you get new excessive thinking you got watch but already have ?"
Definitely out to steal your money I canceled my Netflix subscription 6 hours before putting money in my bank account. They took the money that I had for my phone bill and then told me that because I had only canceled it a few hours before putting my money in the account that they were entitled to my money and then I wasn't guaranteed to get it back in time to pay my phone bill. BAN NETFLIX
Idk if there is a reasson but i think all shows should be on all versions on netflix. Im using Netflix ireland and i dont have access to shows like family guy..
i just love netflix im so addicted! but i think they should add a playlist of all your favourite movies so then you can watch them over and over again.
I love Netflix there's so many cool shows on there there's over 1000 I would say I don't know and can we talk about? How sing 2 is on top 2? That's so stupid it should be on top one like come on.
"Can you please add one feature where long distance couples can watch movies together, something like people presenting screen along with their camera on. Thanks"
"Omg I love netflix it is my go to streaming app and the shows are awesome, but if season 3 of no good nick is not coming, ill be devastated because i think it is amongst netflix's best, and I am full of tension to what happens. No issues with the app. I would suggest to create an option when making an account to make an adults OR kids account. Also, please add new Television shows."
"It's great, plenty of awesome and interesting movies/shows etc 2 watch. would love it if there were more chick flicks 2 download, would also like it if there was a way 2 b able 2 download all things I want 2 watch, some movies and shows cant b downloaded but can b watched but since it would chew up alot of my data 2 watch them I annoyingly cant.. also not sure if this is even a legal option but 2 able 2 change what country im in so I can watch shows that cant b viewed here in Aus b so good"
"1 of the best streaming services available in my opinion. 👍😍 Not as interested in the games as I am the movies & shows, but it's a nice bonus to get it at no additional cost. 👍😄 No ads & easy to use... 👍"
"I remember having movies delivered through Netflix. While I don't always have a streaming subscription, I will when I can. I love the original content, several good movies and shows come to mind when I speak about Netflix. But right now I will be watching cowboy bebop. A true anime classic brought to life. So thanks for doing that. Appreciate you very much"
"Can't turn off subtitles. Every new episode it's automatically turned on pls fix this. Update: its fixed after latest update, app works good and is easy to use"
After the new update on Android I can't find anything if I want to watch a show I was watching on my TV I have to search it I don't know why you had to change it up bring back the old layout it was so much better when you could go to continue watching now you can't
"I fell in love with Netflix exactly three years ago, and my love is still on. Love the app, but I wish Netflix Tudum Newsletter tab would be integrated somewhere in the app."
"It's back!! Like a lot of other users, I was unable to use Hulu on my tablet for quite a while after a recent update. Of course, when I tried to get help, they didn't want to admit the problem was theirs (seems to be Hulu's default position). I just checked it on a whim, and it's finally working properly again. So my 1-star review is back up to 5."
"Finally, Lifetime movies. It's been years. some ads, but didn't interrupt my viewing. You can pay a little more for ad-free, but this was a bundle offered through Verizon. So far so good. The streaming was smooth. Have not tried it on my TV yet. Audio was great as well through my Bose solo soundbar.( no app to control it; just the remote) Just started watching today, but there literally is an INSANE amount of selection for all ages."
The app works fine and always has. But all of a sudden I have to tap the Chromecast button and connect to a TV when I first open the app otherwise the button disappears when I start browsing. The only way to get it back is to close and restart the app. Just giving the developers a heads up I guess. I'm on a Pixel 7 if that helps.
"Best content of all the tv/movie apps in my opinion. However, it falls short to other apps (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, etc.) in a couple of ways I personally believe will improve the app overall. 1. They need to add the skip intro option. 2. Automatically go to a small screen when you want to check a text, email, etc.. More and more I find myself watching on the other apps so I can skip the intros, and be able to multitask."
"The app works great, Hulu works great. This streaming of movies is old hat, been something everyone has been doing from a variety of sources for a while. What's new or maybe newer is streaming live TV. It's an idea that started slow but is now gaining some serious traction. Personally I was always checking on it's progress but comfortable with Comcast and change is a hassle. Comcast has had a virtual monopoly in many markets, like mine. Having the market locked up has lead to a decline of service quality and ever increasing prices. I finally decided I've had enough of flickering and freezing from there degrading wires, crappy servers and an all around bad corporate attitude that allows this to happen. Night one of the NBA 2018 season and Comcast is a mess, had a storm the day before and thier service is even crappier than usual, unwatchable. Turned it off and watched on my phone burning data. Next day I looked at alternatives. Satellite seemed like a crappier Comcast. That left the streaming guys and most are making the cord cutting easy. They dump Comcast's hundreds of idiot channels (""the cat channel, the alien channel"" please!) and scale it back to just what's needed and even have options for picking channels. I picked Hulu because I watch mostly sports. For $39.95 I get all the big sports channels, the local stuff and NCAA league specific channels. I've been using it a week without a problem. Image quality is great, on my phone, tablet, laptop and my tv, beautiful! If I stayed with Comcast I would have to pay for one of the top tear options for big $$$$$, and still have the cat channel just to get all the sports that are included in this 40 buck any screen anywhere no contract plan. Again, the app is great. Hulu is great. Cut that cord!"
"I don't really have any problems with this but that could be because I have the Disney+ and ESPN+ bundle which comes with premium. The quality is good on my tablet and TV, sound is great I can hear everything perfectly fine. I have a big variation of shows to watch, the only thing I don't like is that as soon as I finish watching a movie or an episode of a series I get recommended tons of random shows because I watch an episode or movie. But other than that no problems."
"I pay for the commercial free Hulu; I have to say, the extra few dollars is well worth it. Hulu is a great option if you want to ditch cable; however I suggest getting Netflix too to give you more movie choices. The one thing I've noticed recently is a lot of movies are locked out on Hulu trying to get me to purchase Live TV. It's getting to be like prime where a lot of content is locked. Still a great app; have been using it for years."
"So to begin with let me say I've tried several streaming services for live TV in past. Sling was my favorite for while. Direct TV now and YouTube weren't as good as sling. Then I found hulu with live TV. Let me tell you I was amazed. It's a simple interface, streams load up quick with great quality and decent live TV line up. With sling I had to mix and match to get what I wanted. I paid 50 bucks a month plus taxes for the combination of channels I wanted. With hulu live it had all the channels I was looking for and just 40 bucks a month. Then to put a cherry on top it still gives you access to all the normal hulu content for that same price! Add that with the dvr feature and the on demand stuff and you should never run out of stuff you like to watch. I know the live TV is beta but let me say it's so much better than direct TV now (really their roku app is unusable and their Android app has more bugs than positives to say about it), and easier to find what you want than sling. If you're considering something with live TV I definitely recommend over any of the other services."
"I love Hulu, been a subscriber for many years. the only issue that I have, which is fairly recent is I just purchased a new Samsung galaxy tablet and there is no way to enlarge the picture on non-hd shows to fill the screen. please fix this with a software update. I also noticed that the listings of episodes in a series do not load on the latest version of the Hulu Android app. Like the issue of not being able to fill the screen, a software update could probably fix that."
Hulu has great content. The app was updated and addressed a few of my complaints. So my review went from 1 star to 5 stars. Picture in picture was added ( YAY!!). The only issue remaining is that the play/pause is super tiny in the corner where I often hit the wrong button. An improvement would be front and center on the screen. This isn't enough to downgrade my rating. THANKS HULU for all the app improvements.
"For the last week Hulu has been spotty. I've cleared the cache and memory of the app, uninstalled/reinstalled the app. I also Cleared the memory and cache from my phone, turned it off, then turned it on again... I knew something was wrong, when I discovered I was able to watch my CBS app (3 full episodes) without buffering and interruption on my phone. Hulu, please fix the bugs. Thank You. UPDATE: 9/25/22 Once the Update was available, I clicked on it, and now it works like a charm 😊."
I usually love this app. But the last few days any time I pause and the screen locks it sends me back to the start of the episode. This wouldn't be so bad except I think have to wait a minute or two of watching ads every time this happens and then have to watch ads again a few seconds later when I fast forward to where I was.
"Honestly, I love the app. I use it daily, and it's great. Easy to use, quick loading, and one minor problem for me, which is completely outweighed by all of the great stuff. If you have decent internet, you'll be fine with the loading speeds. There's a large variety too. Much more shows than on Netflix, with many shows having more episodes of a show than are available on Netflix. Great app. Would definitely recommend."
"I think that Hulu is a much better deal than Netflix, I had Netflix almost from when they started and I was happy for quite a while, but there were a lot of shows that didn't ever appear on Netflix. And after a while the price just kept getting higher, so about a year ago I cancelled my Netflix account and opened my Hulu account and haven't looked back. Much better programming, and the price can't be beat. You'll love it, what are you waiting for? 👍"
Absolutely love this app easy to use not bad on keeping up with the movies either better than most. Always has all my TV shows and serious I looking for!! My only complaint is it takes more data and internet than others to stream it. I do wish I didn't even have to have wifi on it all the time if I'm paying to watch it. But over all it's one of the best and better than most. I choose it over Netflix at least they don't just start changing prices on you several times!
Look I love the fact that this is included with my Spotify this is a great app but I got one complain and I really hope that it get somewhere the volume in the commercial in comparison with the show or movie that's play is crazy. No matter the show or movie. The commercials are incredibly loud I have to constantly lower the volume cause I don't want to disturb every one in the House. I believe this could be a easy fix. Thank you for listening
Beautiful interface. It actually reminds me a lot of the sailfish OS. The guide REALLY needs to come to the roku app. High battery usage though. 15% of battery usage after about a 1/2 hr of usage (watching tv over 4G). It takes up more storage than I expected too. How about an option to play media on the roku app instead of in the app?
"*Update: I called them and they were able to unlock the block on my device. It's still a pain, and I hate that it happened, but at least they fixed it quickly and in a friendly fashion.* Normally a phenomenal service. but I've been out of town for a week for work. First couple days works fine, five days into it blocks Hulu on my device until I log in device at my home location. Whats the point in an app if I have to drive home to use it?"
"Hulu is one of the best paid streaming services. Way more to watch and way cheaper than it's competitors. The app works well too. I would like to see a lock option for when I am watching a movie, especially if I haven't turned my screen sideways yet because I am constantly starting a totally different show by mistake. Never once have I experienced an issue with Hulu. Commercials aren't as bad as if you are watching regular TV either."
"One of my favorite Apps to watch. Has all the best old shows and a great offer of some new ones! While this app can be used alone, in combination with a fee others, because of the low price, you really don't have to have any other kind of television service...you can watch so much here! We subscribe every month and it is worth it. The only time we have had issues was while paying with Google Play and, with some effort, it was figured out however, I do wish they would make it a little easier!"
"I came back to HULU. In the past I had an account with HULU but wasn't impressed with the menu of entertainment. Now, I can't get enough of it. THE OLD MAN, THE ORVILLE, and a number of other very well done shows and movies persuaded me to give HULU another chance. And unlike other streaming platforms, HULU is reasonably priced for the quantity and quality of programming I'm getting."
"Streaming apps can sometimes be a niche usage item. That's what Hulu is for me. If Hulu has what you want to watch you'll be there. The selection is broad and deep. Interfaces change from app to app so its nice to see a crisp, clean one once in a while. The menus are clear and the search funtions are quick and painless. Try it out with their free trial!"
"I've been a user of Hulu since it's inception and have been a huge fan ever since. The mobile app is just as functional as the browser, perhaps even more so. EDIT: Despite what other reviewers have said, you can use Hulu in split screen or floating window. I've been doing that for years on Samsung devices. I wish it could be played in the background however without using split/floater windows just like on the computer browser versions."
Great at a even better price. Splurge the extra five or six bucks for no ads. It's worth it. Those things will make you crazy. It's the same commercials over and over and over again. you can do a free trial for a month I believe still and you can add show time and HBO to the free trial as well. Hulu just has a ton of good TV and movies and that's all I use besides Netflix and my Amazon prime and Pluto TV. I am a cord cutter!!!
"awesome, better than netflixs(netflixs is getting creppy anyway). I have unsubscribed online multiple times without any problems, it will prompt and ask if you want to pause..just say no.... lol. I also tried a trial for no adds and it was awesome... but Im cheap so, basic affordable lowest plan. Man you get adds with everything, yall really need to stop complaining about it. Your 7$ a month doesnt cover alot."
"I really enjoy this app on my phone. I love being able to watch Hulu no matter where I am at. Not so excited about the ads, but I will have to put up with it unless I want to pay extra. Since I am not tech savvy I am having a few issues trying to go back to rewatch a episode that I might have fallen asleep and missed some of the content. For some reason I'm unable to locate the option to go back. Other then that I am really enjoying the programming on Hulu."
"Always streams very nice. A pretty good selection of shows and movies that aren't on other streaming video services. I did have some trouble with billing. If you pay for the year, make sure you keep the card you paid with as your main card. If you change it they will charge the new card for the month on auto pay. Just a heads up. Except for that, I have never, so far, had a bad experience or products."
Hulu is great but they didn't have as many options I felt as Netflix does so I tried to cancel my subscription...at first I noticed it kept charging me after I thought I had canceled it online. I decided to call and to my surprise I was talking with someone in less than two minutes. The gentleman I spoke with was incredibly kind and helped me right away. Their customer service made me consider getting a Hulu account again. 😊
"Love it. It's affordable, easy to use & navigate. Only issue I have is when your scrolling the lists, the lists refreshes & you have to start all over (just fyi, Hulu, Netflix has a much better way of searching & thus far, the lists don't refresh on me. Just saying....) But other than that, no other complaints."
"update: thank you Toni! Not sure what she did behind the scenes but finally after 3 weeks it works!! Thank you so much for your help and the other agents that helped out as well! 2 months and was working fine , few annoying issues but now keep getting an error code i have tried trouble shooting with the tips they provide with no success. Next step is to just cancel as im paying and im not able to enjoy watching any of the hulu originals!!"
"Excellent app! After cancellimg our direct tv we tried fubotv and had a nightmare experience, then switched to hulu and it has been fantastic. All the shows we like to watch are available both live and on demand, all the sports teams we watch, no matter where, are available. We cut our cost from over 100 dollars a month for direct tv, to 60 dollars for hulu. We would and do recomend this to our family and friends and would recomend to anyone else. Thank you for such a great service!"
"I purchased the minimal plan. It has most of the shows that I want. It's sufficient for my household. I love all the options. I especially love the fact that I can install it on many devices and my whole family can use it in many different rooms AT THE SAMETIME, watching different things, on just one account. Unlike Netflix, that if you only have two people listed, they are the only two that can watch something at a time. I am absolutely satisfied!!!"
"Great alternative to high cost of cable! Works great, impressive selection to choose from, modern interface and seamless updates keeps it running smoothly. Haven't experienced any issues with the service since I started using Hulu over a year ago. Would definitely reccomend Hulu to others! Even their telephone customer service department was courteous and efficient!"
"Love all of the various shows/movies. Hulu carries a decent amount of ""older"" movies (late 90's-earlier 2000's), which is my favorite ""genre/time"". The one large negative I do have is that there's not an option for NO COMMERCIALS viewing, would even be acceptable to charge a small one-time fee for this optional service."
Love this app. works well on ps4 and my galaxy tablet and TV. I have spent more money in cable than I have with Hulu. I have been able to save. the prices are reasonable and the best part is it stays the same price unlike cable. The nice thing about Hulu is you can choose YOUR OWN set up of what you want. if you don't want to keep ur addition you can cancel and not be penalized. It fits right into my budget and my kids love it. there are movies and shows just like cable. but hulu is better!!
"The app itself is fine. No complaints, though Netflix generally does it better. The service doesn't let me download everything that I want and puts itself at the mercy of TV stations so I cannot covidwatch shows with friends (from network tv). Their selection of shows (especially Hulu originals) is good, but nowhere near as broad as Netflix. Do to the squeeze, I had to choose between H & NF and picking NF was a no-brainer. So long, Hulu."
"I love hulu, it is very cheap with ads but that's to be expected. They don't have ads on movies as far as I know and they also don't go overboard with ads I mean yeah there like 80 seconds long most of the time but that's the longest ad I've ever had. And they have loads of shows for whatever you want to watch. And if you were wondering they do have anime but if that's what your looking for it's best to go to funimation. Overall one of the best."
"I don't really notice the design aspect of alot of apps. They are just kinda there and similar to everything else but this one is really well designed. It's like playing a swipe game. Super simple, not too compact, I'm actually in love with the app design. The shows are good too (jk, love the options provided. Never bored with hulu)"
"Great app with lots of great movies and shows! Absolutely no flaws or complaints. If you're here to complain about ads, upgrade your package! An extra 4-5 bucks a month for no ads is absolutely worth it! Those extra ads you get bridge the gap of that 4-5 dollar difference. If you're trying to pinch pennies, deal with the ads. Otherwise, your out is there!"
"The Hulu app,...... is a very helpful app based on which plan you can afford to purchase,.......it has movies,.... TV shows and sports,..... and many more features that can be helpful to a movie and TV buff,...... I think it still needs some improvement,...... and certain features of the app,..... hopefully they will improve on it overtime"
"I love Hulu, plenty of great shows and movies. I also love the download feature, its nice and convenient to be able to still watch shows and movies offline without paying tons of money for them. My only complaint would be that on the phones you can't view your videos as a pop-up window like YouTube or Netflix, I would really love to see Hulu implement this but other then that its worth the download!"
"One star for the app, not Hulu. Every single thing I watch on the app has a half second buffer every five seconds, making everything unwatchable without going insane. I've restarted my phone, deleted and redownload the app, nothing. I don't have this problem while watching Hulu on my TV, so it's clearly an error on the app. Edit: issue fixed. Thank you!"
Overall a great show/movie watching app . never had a problem with any of the streams or shows. The prices are fair . just heads up with the newest update i dont know if its only me or others but none of my newly watched shows save to me keep watching list i have to go through the episodes to find my place in a show and if i get a call the show restarts and before it would save my place.
"I would have rated this app a 2 or 3 due to the unnessary ads you guys have, and yes im aware if i upgrade my plan i wouldn't have that issue. Unfortunately, when your on a tight budget you can only afford what you can. The reason I rated this app with 5 stars is because you guys have a wider range of movies and TV shows to select from then what Netflix's app has to offer(Which is great!!), but Netflix also has you guys beat because they don't have any ads that disrupts their shows or movies at all. So the ads seriously need to go! They disrupt the TV show or movie your watching which is really annoying...."
"I absolutely love Hulu. It is well worth the extra dollars to not have the ads. Most people dont get that. One thing though, When i try to keep watching a show on 'resume watching' off the home screen, it starts every episode at the last 5 minutes. so i have to keep searching for the show and finding the episode i was on. pretty tedious. didnt used to do that."
"Selection of movies isn't fantastic, without the more expensive plans and add ons, but a reliable service,easy enough to use. I give it 5 stars because they dont try to be sleazy. It's easy to cancel your subscription from within the app without logging into to some website or call center like other companies due to try to make it harder for the customer. You even get the option to pause for a time so you dont get billed but can comeback with same account if needed. :)"
"Hulu used to only play if you had a fast internet signal, and we live in BFE Oklahoma and have a slow-ass signal. I called and complained a few months ago and asked why they couldnt be more like Netflix or Prime and adjust the speed automatically to stream at a lower rate. Well they fixed it and now it streams like a champ. It loads occasionally but shows are still watchable. Hulu now plays the best out of the 3. I am very happy because the streaming content is great!!!!"
"So affordable and so many great movies and shows, rotating at a pace fast enough that I don't get bored with the selections but slow enough to have time to watch and appreciate what's available. One of our most used and appreciated apps, second most used streaming service (but only because I'm an MCUaholic, haha). Definitely worth the subscription fee."
Love this service. It is soooo much better than Sling. I switched from Sling. Hulu has superior video quality. Significantly faster loading times. Fewer commercials. I chose the package that eliminates most of the commercials. Thank you so much for offering this package. I have literally tried every available streaming service over the past five years. Hulu is by far the best!!!
The newly updated hulu is a great streaming service with a myriad of shows and movies. A very useful feature is the pause subscription which also you to pause payments for 1-12 weeks. But while in the feature you can't use the app to watch anything; it's meant for those to catch up on bills or other lifestyle cost until you alot the time to resume payments.
"I love the variety of content, but there have been a lot of errors loading lately. Error ""503""comes up frequently for a network issue but my internet is connected and my other streaming apps are working. I don't like the new interface either.. but that's besides the point lol. 5 stars for the value and content."
"The ads are able to be removed if you up your subscription to the different plan they offer, if you read the fine print in the agreements you will find they don't lie about the ads. The express when they will be and for how long. Free trials are excluded unless you go with the plan that's a few dollars more."
"Been using Hulu for years and I just love it!! I really like how you can do premium add-ons like HBO Maxx, Cinemax, Starz, etc which is something you can't do with Netflix. I got all 3 of those add-ons and I can enjoy more and more of Hulu. I don't really use the mobile app but I stream on Roku and I just came on here to leave a good review. I also pay for ad free service which is only a little extra. A tiny bit more money to get rid of 6 ads in a row is worth it!! Thank you Hulu!!"
"I was a bit leery when I tried this app, but there was a show I couldn't find anywhere else, on Hulu so I gave it a day in court, so to speak. I signed up for their free trial and have been with them ever since. Not had any major issues and only the tiniest bit of lag, and that is very seldom. This app works 100% better than paramount plus and HBO max. If you decide to give it a try, I would suggest trying a free trial of the ad free plan, that's what I have and I'm really enjoying it."
"I love our Hulu+ live, Disney & ESPN bundle. And now unlimited DVR storage!!! We have had Hulu+live for years and I can honestly say, it has only gotten better. Watching on the go and at home with a price that is well worth everything you get. So many shows and movies on demand along with some really good Hulu original TV shows & movies. We had a technical issue not too long ago and the customer service was outstanding. Our problem was quickly addressed and repaired as well. Thank you Hulu!!!"
I love the service it's great! I am dealing with a lot of buffering and it stats that way till I exit the app and restart my phone and go back in. Some of the time it goes to a earlier in the video as if it did not watch to a new point in video. It's not just me my husband has same problem. Please help. Thanks Rose Dragon.
"It is a great app, but I wish they would do more of it. Theres some original content, but it just doesn't happen all that often. Lot of times to start or finish a series you have to go to another streaming site since shows expire on here due to contracts an what not. Awesome service unless its the only streaming service you have. Then its pretty bad."
"Initially, I was unhappy with the app. It was too complicated to just get started watching my selected plan. However, after deleting and reinstalling the app, it worked perfect! I am very pleased with the live tv and movie options. The quality is great!"
"Great app, zero problems. People are complaining about ad volume, get ad free for a few extra bucks or turn your device down...not difficult, not a technical issue. Also noticed a couple reviews that mention technical issues, that is 100% user error. I used Hulu on every device I've ever owned and not one has had any issues regardless of age and hardware. Don't be discouraged by the not-so-tech-savvy reviews!"
"I recommend this for those who tried apps like tubi where the streaming is free. It does charge a month depending on the plan, so Hulu has a very big almost overwhelming array of options. You even get to organize which shows you'll watch later. Lastly please update a ""seen it"" icon . . which maybe isn't needed. I really can't complain brah."
"this comes with an unlimited plan, through Sprint, which makes it a no-brainer to have. even without it coming standard with my plan, the monthly subscription is beyond reasonable at just under $6 per month. It's easy to navigate and makes up for what Netflix lacks in its lineup of shows."
"Lots of channels, movies. There are enough original and main stream series plus movies to keep you busy forever. The only reason to have another service is if you really have to watch something where they have exclusive rights. We have the Hulu, Disney+, ESPN bundle that is truly an overload of Sports, documentaries, series and movies. Watch live, use the built in DVD feature or find most programming on demand. Great picture-never off the air-cheaper than getting all of this on cable."
"I was considering on getting Netflix instead of hulu. I got the free trial on Netflix and it was decent. I couldn't find much to watch without scrolling for 30 minutes so I decided to take a look at hulu. Hulu has a lot bigger verify and I can watch shows and movies that would never be found on Netflix, even with the adds it's worth it"
"Now that I've tried Hulu I'm pretty much addicted. I've watched just about everything I'm interested in on Netflix & Amazon Prime so was looking for an app w/more tv shows & movies of a variety & found that here. From FX to Cartoon Network to Stephen King movies. I only pay like $7.99/month I think, but I have to deal w/5 or 6 commercial breaks during the shows, but each commercial only lasts 1min 30secs. If you wanna pay a few more $ then you can get everything ad-free. It's all a great deal!!"
"Love hulu. Best shows for the best price. However, it wouldn't hurt to switch up the ads. I switched from my prescription to the Verizon Disney/ESPN plus package because it sounded like a good deal. I'm trying to figure out how to pay separately because I hate watching ads. The fact that the ads are exactly the same is what has me searching elsewhere."
"After learning the hard way that if or when you log out of Hulu all your downlaods get deleted, I have to give 5 stars because the variety of movies and tv shows is fantastic with the streaming only with no ads version. Much better than any other streaming only service I have tried. Well worth the money to upgrade to the no ads version. I upgraded to HBO Max recently, and I am very happy with both services together only costing about $28 per month."
"The app has gone better. I pretty much use the app not for streaming but for setting up TV programs that I like for example adding shows on a watch list. I mostly stream from UHD television, so the app is helpful to create watch list than cast to tv. Since using a remote control for television is a little bit bulky or using a PlayStation 5 controller the same way It's far easier to just get your programs that you want to watch on the app. Beyond that, the ui looks great on mobile."
"I just wish they're we less ads during the shows I watch. Just give me an ad at the beginning of the show and at the end of the show, maybe one in the middle if it's a longer show. Also the length of the ads is a little long. should be 45-60 seconds tops. Other than that I love the app. Great selection and quality of shows"
I love that this app has all the old TV shows I've been wanting to re-watch so badly and have been unable to find on other apps though I have continuous issues of it shutting down on my Smart TV and only with this app. The price is a little high for the TV bundle though the basic is very reasonable if you don't mind ads/commercials commercials
"Hulu is by far the best streaming app. I think it completely competes with Netflix in terms of its content, Netflix actually has less content I want to see cuz it's so saturated with all this original content. Hulu has the better original shows and it has episodes of a lot of shows the day after they air which is a huge Plus and I have it connected to my HBO Max account so I don't have to switch between those apps to watch shows on either one. Hulu definitely has my vote and it's well worth it."
"I'm cutting the cord. ""high price cable"". I'm in the middle of 3 different online live T.V. Free trial packages w/DVR. I got the best packages available, to get the Best idea. Prices were all good. But hulu offfers way more for less. It needs work on the TV guide. A lot better than sling. And it offers the sports I'm looking for."
I have cancelled my Netflix and I'm loving Hulu. Only thing I don't like is that you can't skip the intro. When I'm binging on CSI from episode 1 till the end. I have to mute the intro cause sound is 5 times higer than dialogue. I don't need to see credits 300 times. What I love is the selection and variety. I don't have cable so I always have something good to choose from.
"Hulu does have a TON of ads. Well, not a ton but the can get annoying, but if you pay for the premium then it shouldn't be a problem! If it is still, then contact Hulu,and they should take care of the problem right away, Well at least in my situation they did. Since I love anime they had a lot of it, except for Hiaku which I choose to hold a grudge for. Hulu is a pretty good app to have, and if you download it onto your TV, phone , wherever and sign in it will save all your progress! It's great!"
"I love hulu it works perfect and there is a variety of things to watch from tv series, old tv series, movies, old movies and older movies and shows that got dicontinued or still going. The only thing is when you replay something an there was a ad it replays the ad again. Other than that this app is perfect and cheap."
"absolutely love Hulu. but sometimes the network doesn't work well and always stops your programs and you have to reboot the App on your TV, Phone, Tablet etc. And I am upset about the way you pay for the use of this service but cannot watch the live wherever you want to if it not from a device that has already been recognized. for example when I go to family members house for get togethers and we want to watch something that's on Hulu I can log into my profile w/live because I'm not at my home."
"There are a lot of flashbacks, so this does need to be watched when you can pay full attention to the show. I struggle with this at times, but I haven't wanted to pay attention to anything but what is happening on screen. The story feels fresh especially the way it is slowly and carefully woven. I love that I care about the characters because the story is allowed to unfold in a unique and organic way. The acting is AMAZING!"
"From an original FREE app (with commercials) to a PAY app (with commercials)...two years ago the price was two high, the selection stale, and the app inadequate. Nice to see Hulu's has leveled up it's selection and app making it finally worth a subscription price under $10."
"This is the app that finally had the guts to give us the bright green borders and highlights against a dark background that we have been craving for over a decade. Hulu did that nobody else. Five stars because it's so green. Also if I start watching a show that turns out to be something I don't want people to know that I watched, they make it super easy to trim and edit my viewing history. Even though I've never done that, I feel good knowing that the feature is there for all of you."
"we all love Hulu and its features. it's basically what dvr used to be, but you don't have to tend to it now. lol app itself works exactly as expected. designed to match the TV apps on all the other devices. so it has very nice fluidity."
"Favorite streaming app! It is a bit of a challenge to adjust to online streaming. The online streaming apps are not perfect, but they are descent to say something positive about them. I have not experienced any problems yet with anything online streaming related. It is good to bring the family together and get them to gather for movie time or just watch an old, new or present favorite show. I really love having Hulu to watch my favorite shows like educational and religious shows. :)"
"Even tho I have to watch my shows a day after they aired, it's a great price for good entertainment. Being disabled I rely on programs and movies for entertainment. I've never run out of things to watch, and I have the bare minimum subscription."
"First don't get me wrong,I Love Hulu! But lately there's been a problem with the app staying open,I start watching something then,kicked out!! I'm extremely concerned about this,I know the service is paid! I've tried uninstalling /reinstall, clearing the cache & storage..everything that I've could think of or been recommended..Again nothing is working! I started watching Jumanji Welcome to the jungle... got as far as the drums on the sand...then kicked out!! MY OTHER APPS ARE FINE!"
We love Hulu because it gives us all the channels we care about. Add to that all the Hulu originals and the ease with which we can set up to record when a particular movie is broadcast. Getting rid of the satellite was a wonderful decision!
"Can't describe how an app can develop a plethora of movies to enjoy when you're busy, in free time mode or even just not up for the spontaneous, yet interesting people in the theater. The TV shows just adds to the excitement. Thanks GooGLe! 👌"
quality is good on phone. Audio is nice and loud enough that people are trying to see what I'm watching. At home it could use some work. On the fire stick it struggles but is tolerable
"try them all. I do believe Hulu has less issues.. however, I think when you pay extra for all the extras they should make it easier to watch it remotely. doesn't let you cast some of your stuff while on the road. also you pay extra for no ads but most of the premium stuff still has ads. other than that, great. I give it four out of five stars"
"I absolutely love Hulu. I have almost all streaming apps. However the one I can't go without is Hulu. It has all my favorite shows, including shows no one else has. Hulu is by far my favorite. If HBO max and Hulu teamed up to combine Netflix and the others would be put out of business quick! ""SuperStore"" being my comfort show is why I got Hulu lol and now I NEED Hulu. I ditched the regular cable for it and I've had it since 2019 and they've only gotten better as time goes on."
"I love it, better than netflix, especially because netflix is limiting viewers at once. We have a household/family of 5, and we all like to watch our own hulu shows, and you guys don't limit your viewers. You are going to be a turning point in a pivotal time in streaming. One note though: I sometimes watch a show and have like 5 minutes left and it will just play the next episode if I have to leave it and watch it later instead of playing the last 5 minutes. Could you turn that off?"
I had Netflix since they were mailing DVDs and they kept raising my price and started getting less and less great content. Hulu is so much better I hope they keep their prices the same and not upcharge every year. Great content easy to navigate and they have the best shows!!
"I love my Hulu App. It was such an easy transition. The best thing about Hulu as a TV provider is it goes wherever you go. It's very easy to pick up your device, set your recordings and enjoy at your leisure."
"exceptional streaming service. Flawless functioning, very well laid out for ease of operation. A selection of shows and movies with something for everyone. No visible flaws."
"I subscribe to Hulu and, as an add-on, Showtime. There's always something good to watch and the user interface of the app on my TV and tablet are awesome. I consider Hulu one of my core streaming sites."
it's great but a little too expensive for live tv besides that it's great I prefer this more than sling because of the interface it's so easy to find shows I especially like the similar movies it shows me when I finish watching a good movie it points me to other similar ones 👍
I kinda want to take one of the stars back for differentiating between dubs and subs but also acknowledge this might be an essential feature for some people because of interpretational differences or shiet localization teams. App never has any problems tho...
"I give 5 stars. However, sometimes while watching it trying to watch. I can see the count down and usually hear the show but nothing on the screen. not sure if it's Hulu or my TV. sometimes it takes days to get back to normal. Love Hulu though. My fav streaming channel of all"
Plenty to watch to suit anyone's taste. I like being able to movies from when I was a kid and then watching remakes. Oh and the series are the best for rainy weekend binges.
App has come a long way. works great. probably one of the best UI of all streaming platforms. downloading is great for when we're traveling.
Very good but seriously starting to add ads for specific stuff when you pay for no ads? Either Hulu isn't wanting to pay enough for the content or the content creators are wanting too much. Either way we are paying the price for it.
Hulu has been a refreshing change. Just a few minor issues at the start with my local channels. Customer service took care quickly & in a very professional manner. Thank you!
"Revised 4.21.2023 oh no, go back to the old version. The new version keeps closing out over and over and over again ____________________Great app, great user interface. The only things I'd add are info for on screen cast members that links you to other content (like amazon prime video has) and offer your live tv subscribers an ad-free option."
"Pluto should have a very good rating! it is one of the first original apps that allow users to view many shows for free. I love the fact that it plays video while you search the menu or guide. this gives the app a good feel for live TV unlike others who are quiet while searching for something to watch. keep up the good work, Thanks!"
"It IS free. You get what you pay for. Tons of classic shows: I Love Lucy, Unsolved Mysteries, Carol Burnett Show etc The app was working fantastic. No issues. Unfortunately, this past week has brought out glitches. For instance: you're watching 1 show, the screen freezes, throws you into a different show. If this keeps up I will uninstall because it's unwatchable at this point. *** Edit. After that particular week of glitchiness I reinstalled. No issues. Variety of channels."
"Live channels are the best way to use this app. Lots of variety. Thanks for adding NFL network. Yes it gets glitchy sometimes but I find that if I close the app and clear the cache it works fine. The ad breaks are not as bad as network television, they have 2 minutes of show and 10 minutes of commercials. Pluto has short ad breaks. I have been able to use the Pluto app for 24 hours without issues. I don't have cable or network service so Pluto is great for me."
I absolutely love Pluto television! It's one of the very best real-time TV and motion picture apps I have actually ever before made use of. The user interface is really easy to use and it's simple to search for the channels and flicks you desire. The quality of the video clip is great and the app is really dependable. I would absolutely suggest it to anybody seeking a wonderful means to see real-time television and flicks.
"This is a great app. It's completely legal and free. If you create an account, you'll be able to make a Watch List and sync it with other devices. Good quality HD content and a very diverse mix of old and new, cult and classic, documentaries, movies, TV shows and live TV programming. My only gripe is the constant commercials. I know that's what makes it free but if they could find a way to cut the commerical time in half this app would be perfect."
Love the App!! It has something for everyone. I am constantly coming across things I used to watch growing up and kind of forgot about. I constantly haven't playing either on my phone or on my PS5. You should have add a return button. Makes easier to channel surf. Also a screen lock feature for mobile devices.
"I'm updating my review again. The streaming is much better than it was. The program description is not always accurate (the plot may be for the current show, not what you click on). The on demand issue is fixed. You can watch it in pieces and after just a couple of seconds into the show it updates you to where you left off."
overall it's a great application. I do wish they would allow us to favorite channels. this way it would be much easier to find channels when you were trying to find them we have certain channels we really like some channels are just fluff and filler but I do appreciate the fact if there are a few real channels on here and the movies are pretty decent. The problem is when Pluto goes into commercial it seems the blank commercial in the TV show three times. Both of my phone into my TV
"Pluto TV with its wide variety of shows in english and spanish usually offers me more excellent choices than i am able to watch. Also available are games and music. And of course, Dog TV. As one can expect, there are commercials. I do not mind these as the frequency is about the same as regular TV. And as with regular TV i use these to get tasks done. The only thing that I have a problem with is the amount of data consumed."
"'Pluto TV' works just like cable TV, except there's no bills to pay. It's free with ad support; but, you'll see no more ads than watching the same show OTA, cable, or on satellite. The interface reminds me of TV Guide channel and it's extremely easy to use. It's owned by CBS/Paramount/Viacom so there's an insane amount of content to watch. The app streams flawlessly even on my low powered tablet, no buffering or stutters. I have absolutely zero complaints about 'Pluto TV'. It's a winner."
"I'm giving Pluto TV a five star rating because it was one of the first in the beginning of streaming services that I enjoyed and still do. I love the ability that it doesn't always have to go to full screen on my phone. While I like some of the news and weather channels, those streams seem old and confusing. There are certain channels I love watch and I'm very appreciative for this service / app. 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Pluto keeps getting better. Thanks for always adding new channels. It takes a minute to find my Chromecast, but it will. If i turn my phone to the side to watch, i wish the arrows for switching channels would stay on the screen a little longer, then go away. A previous channel button would be good. Commercials i understand, but it might show the same one 5 times in a row. I hope one day we'll get a rock/metal video/documentary type channel. I still give 5 stars, 'cause it's free, so thanks. 👍🏻"
I love this app. I use it on my firestick. Everything is free (for real free not just some of it and then pay for additional). I use the app one my phone for the remote but can also use the firestick remote to change channels etc. I am actually surprised at how much content is available. There is also on demand options. There are ads. I don't think the ads are too much considering EVERYTHING is free but you might see the same one a few times in a row.
"Awesome! I watch it all the time and saved my Favorite channels. They have a whole channel of some of my favorite shows: Chef Ramsay shows, Wipe Out, Unsolved Mysteries, Bruce Lee movies, Cats Gone Wild, etc. Try it, you'll love it!!! Two complaints are that we need a ""back"" or ""prev channel"" button because its easy to lose your place of where you were before trying another channel. Also, as the channel has become more popular, as usual, I noticed that there are ridiculously more commercial breaks than on Network TV. They are shorter, but more frequent and occur at the most inopportune times, like in the midst of a sentence or suspenseful event, and then again at a normal commercial break. They are already repetitive, which I can handle, but they are making shows run much longer. Dudes! Viewers can tell when independent companies start getting greedy. You guys can afford to turn down some ads and breaks to keep viewers happy, or we just go back to renting DVDs or binge-watching our shows on Tubi, Sling, or Netflix with 0 commercials wasting our time. Please don't take your viewers for granted."
"It is an AMAZING app for being free. There's not even too many commercials, and I haven't even seen an option that would have required or even request payment. I've seen ads for it and I always thought ""well it can't be completely free"", or ""it must not work well"" but it is the complete opposite. Basically, I like to think of it as kind of a free Netflix or Hulu (it's obviously not the exact same, but pretty close) because it works well like you're paying for it."
"Live TV buffers. Buffers. Buffers. Buffers. Buffers. Do you see a trend here?  Edit: Was contacted by developer very quickly, which was great. I read some other reviews and tried closing out apps which were open in the background. This fixed the buffering issue. Lots of channels. It would be nice if Pluto could add some major networks like CBS, NBC and ABC. Otherwise, very happy! Changed to 5 stars."
"It's free TV 🔥 You don't even have to sign up to watch. There's lots of genres and on-demand which is nice. Ads don't bother me because it's like watching broadcast. I will say that sometimes it's a little choppy in the transition from show to commerical but it is easily forgivable... again, no fee totally free tv. It's pretty great overall. Ability to cast is awesome!👍👍"
"I love this app it has everything you need , news , entertainment, many different genre's of movies and stories and sports ! I watched this app when I was in the hospital and there tv satellite went out I was still able to see the news , weather , and sports ! I would love to them see them add local broadcasts to offer more variety in sports , they have football, Basketball, and some college as well and there well worth watching . The new Spring Football Leagues are hard to find ."
"Pluto surpassed my expectations across the board. By continuously upgrading the app, they were able to break new ground. Now I see many apps trying to copy the success of the Pluto app, falling short and failing epicly. Keep up the good work ! I love your programming and would like to see more of 70's and 80's programs, that we all grew up with."
"I was exposed to Pluto through a friend's Roku TV. I had seen the app before in the app store, but was undecided. After just a few days, I'm not sure why I waited so long! A good general selection of channels and crystal clear. Works perfectly on my LG phone. As for the commercials....it is as one expects from television. Very pleasantly surprised!! Well worth giving it a try!"
"From the ""Stone Age to Modern Times"" in one update. The latest update was too much of a fast change and ruin the way I usually navigate through the movie guide. Also, I cannot get the picture and picture mode to work on my cellphone anymore (reinstalling now). Works on my tablet. Overall, I like the movie station 💯% A lot of ppl probably complain about the commercials but they don't bother me and I don't think I graduated from basic TV yet. I also enjoy the selection of movies."
"*update* This issue has been addressed. It is now a pretty close to perfect app. -------------- Update makes casting, frustrating. When casting any video the screen changes to only give you the option to change the channel up/ down, no longer does it show the channel guide when casting. You must disconnect from your device, stop casting to go find another show then recast all over again, unlesss you want to press up/down through dozens of channels. It makes casting not worth the effort."
Love this app!! It's like having cable or a TV service. Has all the stations u want and a TV guide. Is awesome on the go or traveling. And ok about the ads.....listen for a free app they aren't so bad. Each tv station keeps going there's no pausing so for me to have a small break and go do something else for a min and then come back to watch my show it's not so bad. People are so spoiled in getting what they want all the time they don't know anything else. It's like regular TV commercial but not so long. Thank you. It doesn't bother me :)
"I LOVE this app! There ARE a few annoyances like no search bar, no being able to save stuff, does get loud all of a sudden at times, the line up for shows repeats itself like 3 times in 24 hours and the shows are repeats themselves (which is my biggest annoyance)BUT this app is FREE. I can't believe how low the rating is. It's ALWAYS dependable for me, commercials don't bother me at all as they do tend to be repeated but I'm used to commercials and it gives me a chance to do anything I need to."
"It's great. I wish there were more channels to watch, like more live sports and live documentaries but it's free and they have a great selection so I can't complain, also I dont see many repeat shows so that's always a bonus! For the most part I love the app and use it almost every day. Whenever I have a problem, customer service is very nice and responsive to any troubles that I may have. Keep up the good work and add more channels! Lol I'll be watching"
"It's free tv. I've been using this for years is fantastic. I don't know why there is so much complaining about commercials. It's not gonna be just free tv without it. Pluto is absolutely amazing. Great new update that allows you to scroll by category. I'm glad this exists one of the best things ever all free no bs. Also with the whole Chromecast issue. Possible resolution download it directly to TV, phone, laptop, Xbox, PlayStation etc and you can also play it that way. Love Pluto"
"I really like Pluto tv for a lot of different reasons. Mainly how good the quality of the shows and movies! For a free app, it's super good. Another thing I really like is their content is a nice mixture of shows I grew up with as well as new movies. Another thing is functionality is superb, no connection issues, no a/v issues. Overall, pretty awesome! ❤️"
"This app and service keeps getting better and better. Been using this for several years. Pluto has added a bunch of new channels since then. I mainly use the Roku app. The last update to version 5 on Roku added some great changes. Such as the option to add movies into your watchlist. The only thing that I believe Pluto TV is missing is a search bar in the On Demand. The ability to search for a particular title, actor/artist or genre would be even more awesome!"
I love it it's Free! one thing that would be great though is being able to enter in your channel number or a title to find it. sometimes it gets frustrating going through everything just to find something. & When I edited my Channels on my phone they all still come up on the tv. and please try to find diffrent old episodes instead of the same ones every single night. would be easier than switching to netflix because I've seen them the night before over and over. otherwise can't really complain.
First and foremost ITS FREE! If you are a cord cutters like myself I encourage you to download this app now. I never have any buffer issues or any issues for to that matter. Chromecast is needed to cast onto the TV and it works fine for every channel except one. Game Show Network doesn't Cast and I believe this is a copyright issue or something with Pluto. Other than that I would give it 10 stars if I had the option because I am saving almost $200 a month from cutting the cord.
"it is so rare that you find apps nowadays that have such Integrity as this one and yet provide such awesome service! When they say free, they really mean free! Period! no strings attached! Hulu and Netflix are all well and good, but sometimes you kind of feel like you don't want to choose what to watch or just keep binging on the same thing, but you want something played for you where you don't know what it is! This gives a genuine TV experience at not just less cost, but no cost! Keep it up!"
"Finally... A real, legit free television app where you can just watch tv. No account or subscription required, just watch tv! There is an account setup though for some extra features if you desire to do so. It has a good selection of tv shows, movies, sports, news and more. It's like a basic cable package in the palm of your hand. Get this app!!!"
"Just installed it and I have to say, I'm very impressed! This is better than what free public T.V. used to be. A decent selection of shows and movies to watch for free, I mean really free! There are commercials, but I get those on cable that I pay for. I am surprised at the number of channels available in each catagory. Several news channels, documentary channels, crime tv channels, comedy, horror, sitcoms, etc. It streams well too! No lagging."
"A great assortment of tv shows and movies, many of which can't be seen anywhere else. I would prefer less commercial interruption as I get enough of that watching regular TV, but understand they're necessary to fund and pay for the programs. One recommendation. If at all possible, please find a way to provide offline service to those (like me) who don't always have the luxury of mobile data or wifi access. If available offline, more people would download and recommend Pluto tv to others."
"Pluto is great! It takes away the pain of having to select something to watch with a more traditional, cable-style layout. There's a ton of free content and the selection is constantly changing. I've been using Pluto for years and have yet to get as bored with it as I have Hulu and Netflix. Highly recommend, and this app makes navigation so much easier!"
"Love ve this app. I've tried it back in the day but now it's different. Its awesome. I have a lot of apps;Hulu, Netflix exedra, but I pretty much find my self using Pluto most nights now. Has everything I need. News, horror movies, cult classics. Always something to find when I get tired of scrolling through the other apps. Yes there's ads,and they can be repetitive however no where near as bad as cable. Small price to pay for free tv imo."
"I really like using this app on my phone, laptop, and telly especially. I am able to watch MST3K and Rifftrax, as well as check the weather. I primarily use the Live TV section, and I use it often. The only major downside I have with it is that the same ads keep playing constantly (For the last time Pluto TV, I am not watching Siesta Key). Other than that, I really enjoy it."
Too too many commercials!! . I like your app. I'd pay a reasonable fee to not have to deal with these. Please tell you are searching a way to lessen and/or eliminate the commercials. I really want to keep this app. I'm still hanging in there with Pluto. I changed my rating to 4 stars. You've added more channels and I've gotten use to the commercials. Great app. Very little buffering. Lots of channels 💖💖💖
This app is exactly as advertised. Free tv. All you have to do is finish a quick and simple registration process. Tons of classic and new tv shows and movies. The only downside is that the timing of the commercials. They sometimes kick in mid-sentence of a show but I'm not going to lower my rating just because of that. This app is great and they show a lot fewer commercials than regular tv
"For a free app, this is a good one. I really like the live tv option. Theres a couple things that I wish it had. The app on my Roku tv is perfect, it plays the next episode ony list, and you can look through your favorites list. But those options aren't available on the phone app. Not anything I can't live without but it would be nice to have."
"This is amazing!!! Cancel your cable subscription NOW! This is like basic cable, but better cause you also get On Demand features. There are commercials, but I'm not complaining cause its free and amazing quality! Streams well over data service but works better on WiFi. The only thing that would make this better is a search bar, so you can see when shows are coming on live tv and you can find programing in the On Demand sections easier."
"The selection is immense, the format is user friendly and I am finding shows and movies that are not available on any other format much less one that is totally free. This is a must have for anyone that loves new and old tv and movies especially those that are cutting the cord with cable and satellite. Oh and not to mention there is live tv as well as streaming movies and shows. I cannot praise this app enough. Did I mention it is all totally free! Thank you pluto tv!"
"I've been watching PlutoTV online for a couple years, and I am very happy with this app. Simply provides a more mobile-friendly interface for the player and sends notifications when there are new channels, specials, or important news events. Player will shrink the window and play ontop of other apps, I like having the TV on as background so that's great. Almost all content except really old shows have CC, text size and don't can be adjusted. Really great app for a really great service, thanks!"
"this is hands down the best visual media i have. i only have the free stuff. i don't mind watching commercials. i just don't have the money to pay to watch tv ( remember when it really was free, before companies figured out how to charge for it besides commercials? now you get both). this app has so many choices that i have totally ignored my other apps"
"Awesome app, You can't get things like this for free anymore. the quality and everything about it's great except for when you find a movie on demand, there beyond bombarded with commercials to the point where you tend to lose interest in the movie, besides that a 100% awesome, use it all the time just not the demand part unless I really really want to see a movie that's the only way my attention span can work between the every 10 to 15 minute commercial breaks 😕"
"Absolutely Awesome and It's Free!! There's always something to watch, with an amazing amount of channels for all types of preferences. I had no problem activating on all tv's (fire tv 4k sticks) and the app works very well. There are live channels and on-demand. If your internet connection is sluggish, you may have trouble with the stream. For a better experience, you can set up your cell phone as a remote for Pluto TV. If You Are A Cord Cutter Like I Am... PLUTO TV IS A MUST HAVE!! 👌"
"Great application! No issues for me. Movies and TV run very smooth and super quick on my Samsung Galaxy S9+. A few commercials here and there but definitely worth it because its FREE! Movies and TV shows are never boaring, excellent selection of entertainment. PS: Pluto TV has a very nice ONLY music selection of all genre's. It displays a nice equalizer display, which is cool for being at home when you don't want to watch TV, just set it on your smart TV, and play it!"
"Great experience but keep your expectations realistic to really enjoy the portable and FREE aspects. Pluto TV people: it would be cool if you could select a future wshow and set a notification to remind you when it's on. Oh, and a ""last channel"" button like on a remote to take you back to the last channel would be super useful. Thanks for making a great app"
"Awesome. Underestimated. I watched Forest Gump last night by chance and loved it. The commercials are just what you would expect from cable. Didn't feel invasive, like with phone games. I have this on my Android TV and just got it for the phone. It's nice to flipping channels instead of always needing to find exactly what I want. Don't get me wrong, there are some on demand options. For developers: lip sync seems to be an issue time to time. But keep up the good work"
"I've been using this app for a while now. I do not use it everyday because it has so many features that I don't have time to do that. It actually is live TV with numerous channels and even and on demand feature! My experience has been that it works as advertises and really is free. Your mileage may vary but I personally recommend the app. Oh, do note that like TV, it has actual advertising. So far it is inacuous enough."
"This app would be the greatest thing since the antenna, but ot keeps closing about a minute after I open it and won't let me change the channel. The first couple times I used it I had no issues. Pluto, please tell me why this is happening! I want to watch the news! Also, the remote in the app does not work for me. I can use the Roku remote, which is ok, but can vary from a moderately tedious to insanely tedious."
"This service [Pluto] is amazing. 100% free TV on all of your devices. About the same amount of advertising as any cable TV station but without the monthly cost. No local news, but I can watch those for free on their websites. Great national news. Documentaries, sports, dramas, newer movies, lots of exclusive content, all on one convenient and easy to use app. I highly recommend Pluto to anyone on a budget. Five stars all the way!"
"I love this on my Roku at home and I love it on my Android phone on-the-go too. It's a must have app imo if you enjoy exploring a large variety of tv entertainment from classic shows to current films, streaming music channels and everything in between. There are periodic ad breaks, not bad. Thanks Pluto for helping me ""cut the cord"" and not losing a minute of the best cable could offer."
Edit 8/2 so they resolved both original problems I wrote about now I am very happy again with this app. All sorts of show options on live and on demand. I see alot of compliments about too many commercials but I'm not having too many problems with that. On the live TV option for the most part it goes to commercials when it would normally every so often it goes sooner but also some times it skips the pre-planned commercials and continues the show. The on-demand can be different though.
"I mean, it's free tv shows and movies ... Some of y'all are ridiculous. The ads are no different than watching regular broadcast tv, so you'll pay for the service of cable and still watch ads but complain about Pluto? Just the same as any other free streaming service. Have never had any issues with shows playing. EXCELLENT and very broad selection of shows and movies to watch. Definitely one of the top free streaming apps."
"The content on their platform has gotten much better since I last used it. I have a YouTube TV, Netflix, and Hulu subscription but I find myself just putting on Pluto.TV more often because I can always find a channel that has watchable content. This isn't the case when I'm looking for something specific obviously but if you don't feel like sifting through a catalog of endless videos Pluto.TV has great ""live"" content and best of all it's free!"
"I've been using Pluto for almost 4yrs now and it's just been getting better and I use it every day. Some times it will lag but not to the point it will freeze. The app is completely free and has a vault of movies to watch on demand. My only complaint is that they seem to add channels for individual shows which is absolutely unnecessary, a waste of real space and opportunity to add channels with more variety. Why do we need an Adams family channel or housewives channel?! Just ridiculous!"
"WOW! I'm a marketer and have experience doing app marketing. this app has the best UI experience that I've seen. every detail was well done, down to the educational video in the tv version of the app. good content and smooth interface. The only thing, would be to add a search button. I couldn't find one."
"I love PLUTO's free live TV. The channel guide sorted by different types of genres mostly, thus making it more easy to navigate. Its easy to find movies/shows that are rare to watch anymore. I can watch movies & shows on the go. I can browse my PLUTO app while watching other movies/shows. The only thing I do not like is that PLUTO is not part of my current cable service search as a ""watch option"" while looking for movies/shows. The android app helps me."
This is a great app for free entertainment. I like how you can watch lots of titles on demand when you want to watch them. Also the live tv type feature is great but alot of the channels aren't my type of viewing. Provides pretty accurate info about each show or movie. The app on some devices works better than on others but its great for free. I have been using Pluto tv since the beginning and it has improved so much. Keep offering the free content... It's appreciated by a lot of people.
"I love this app! Lots of great content! There's a large variety of movies and TV shows to choose from and they have every genre you can think of! My only issue is that it doesn't have a ""Continue Watching"" section in the Movies and TV section, so I have to search for the movie I was watching all over again and that's annoying! Please add that feature!"
"Works perfectly on my fire stick the content an channels is pretty awesome I must say. The built in guide is a Godsend, the only thing with it is that you cannot see very far on each channel, would be nice to be able to see 24 hours of guide per channel. Btw thanks for all the shows, movies, specials, news and music. I adore this app and have alot of fun seeing all the diffent channels an content."
"Since moving I havent had my tv set up to use and this app saved my sanity. I have watched excellent movies and former tv shows. One in particular, The Magnificent Seven, has been one I fell in love with and have watched over and over. I have had problems being able to watch several of the shows because they will not load for some reason which is very disapointing. I would be ecstatic if they would bring this series back with the same cast. They all were perfect for their characters. Luv Pluto"
"I used to use the app frequently, but the new update had removed the Favorites section (I used to be able to save my favorite channels but not anymore). I can live with the ads, but bring back the original functions! Edit: It looks like the Favorites was restored. As such, I've restored my original rating of five stars. Thanks!"
"I've been using Pluto for awhile now. I've read all these bad reviews and I'm not having any of these experiences... ads are commercials.. half as many tho. I've installed it on the oldest crappiest phones I've had in the past for the kids to watch with a Chromecast to stream it to the tv and it works great. Try it out, you don't like it then uninstall it... To the people saying it's a waste, your opinion is exactly that... your opinion."
"I greatly enjoy the app, however there are some issues that they should fix. For example; There are times where you watch a movie, you'll be an hour into the movie or even just a few minutes. It will suddenly cut you back or further into the movie. They should try and fix it, as it is quite annoying. Other than that the app is over all great."
I live unfortunately with small mountains around me. I'm kind of in a valley between them.Today three out of five phone providers you can't get good reception or pull up apps on your phone and use without interruption but Pluto TV is excellent I have no problem never cuts off great service I love this app! I'm very pleased does not cost me a dime. I've been using it for quite a long time and yet I have not watched the same thing twice. Would not even change it for Netflix.
"The best free streaming service out there, period. As far as the ad breaks, they aren't too bad in all honesty for TV shows, the ad-breaks on HULU are longer! The breaks are not as repetitive ( like you see won't see the *same* ad over and over) But what is wild is that they even have on-demand videos! The other day I was told about a movie to check out, there were no services that had it (besides to rent) and they had it here! (I am streaming Pluto on the TIVO 4K stream, no movie issues for me)"
"Great app, solid selection of movie channels and other channels you may not find anywhere else for free, like Bloomberg. There's a lot of ads, but seems fair for the quality of the content. Haven't had any of the problems others have had streaming, even using Chromecast."
for a couple of days I'm experiencing problems.when I watch on my phone the screen flips to a small screen and sometimes the volume just disappears.also for a few days when you go to a station that explanation stays with what you had like Kitchen Nightmares I go to another movie and it says Kitchen Nightmares. that happens until you turn it off and back on I still love it but it's getting really annoying because you have to go back every 20 minutes and make it big again and then turn on the sound
"At first I thought how great can free TV be? I'm so glad I tried this, I don't think I'll ever go back to any other tv! This tv is a whole nother experience, they have many channels, you will find something you love and if you love 90s and 80s shows boy will you love this! It's an amazing retro experience, they also have many more modern shows and movies! On demand, channels, music, everything! I used to have cable (spectrum) and it's not as good. There is way less commercials too amazing!"
"Pluto tv is amazing. I am shockedthat you offer this for free. Comcast cable is anywhere from 60 to over 100 per month, and I feel you get more content here than you do there. As long as pluto tv remains free, I will never pay for cable again, and I appreciate that. It means alot being on a major budget. My only complaint is where is the search bar?? I have looked everywhere and haven't seen one. Going through everything manually is tedious. Get a search bar and it would be perfect. 4 1/2 stars."
"Love this app. I love that it is FREE. TV should always be FREE especially if it's going to have commercials. Hope to continue seeing more improvements: more channels, more shows, less repeated commercials, and no inappropriate commercials on the kids channels. Did I mention that I love that it is FREE. If this app ever goes to a paid subcribtion I will change my review and give it one star. I will continue to support you as long as you stay FREE."
"Absolutely amazing and would be worth spending money on. The fact that its free (ad supported) is really awesome. it works on any device flawlessly from what i have seen. Ps4, phone, tablet, computer. I dont own a smart tv but i would bet it will work on those. All my friends that i have told about it love it. Free tv and movies on demand its just wow. It was pointed out to me that paid tv still has commercials so technically this is very free."
"It's free,cool selection,and fantastic!!! I hope it's maintaned well the shows are frequently renewed, and is always kept free and not allowed to be taken over by too much commercials!! Apps that are free like this are rare and usually come to a sad end, I hope not. Whoever is responsible for Pluto, thank you very much!! Love it very very much!!"
"Great app for cord cutters. This is actually a great app to watch a fairly decent amount of (ad-based, of course) on demand (TV shows/movies/etc.). It's definitely the best free app of its kind available. And, it actually streams better than some of the other (paid) streaming apps I use on my 'fairly old' tablet. The ONLY negative I can think of is that I sometimes notice the audio stream seems to sound heavily compressed/garbled/muffled. But overall, this app is impressive."
"I had no idea this app is better than cable TV - many, many channels - live TV, plus movies, TV shows and series. More TV viewing which has something for everyone's tastes!! Get rid of Comcast and all the other high priced cable providers. I cut the cord with the cable companies on a permanent basis over a year ago, and no looking back!! With these apps, created by great minds - thanks to all of you, we do not need over-priced cable moguls. We can get enough televised entertainment Free!!"
"Edit: Never mind, it must've been an error on my end. I tried it on my Chromebook and it worked fine. I was able to make an account. I guess I entered my email in wrong or something. This app will be great for watching movies or TV shows downstairs when I need to watch my puppy. I very rarely watch on the TV. Especially since my mother uses the TV."
"App is fast, stable , great selection and easy to understand features. OVERALL- THIS APP IS HARD TO BEAT. I wish that there was a low data or data saving mode like TUBI. ADS ARE VERY TOLERABLE and not intrusive compared to other similar apps. Ads are denser & more plentiful depending on times of day or days of the week just like broadcast and cable. On the downside, because not all seasons of many shows are represented, one can be faced with reruns of reruns of many shows."
"I discontinued cable services due to high costs and continually rising costs.When told would not happen and did. Pluto, I like the variety of shows and movies, love the classic movies and shows. Yet, too many repeats and ads at times, reason I give 4 stars. But not like cables repeats. I love the fact Pluto is free. Like tv was always free a long time ago."
"For the devs, there is just one function i would like to see added to the on demand section, and that is a search feature. if i already know what i want to watch and what category its in it would be less of a hassle if i could just search for it instead of scrolling through everything again. Otherwise this is the best free tv app around with a small amount of ads. ads are usually the biggest turn off for these kinds of apps. Thank you devs & Pluto for the wonderful app. please dont change much."
"Unlike other apps I've tried the picture-in-picture works for this one. I opened it up to Red Dwarf, and saw MST3K, RiffTrax, and Unsolved Mysteries available. I felt like a kid again! There's more/better tv options on here than my local basic cable provides (and I will NEVER return to them). Commercials cut in abruptly and often, but you don't miss any show for them. I usually wait a bit longer before reviewing an app, but I was so happy right off the bat I decided to review right away."
"I'm impressed. Pluto TV is upping it's game and still going strong. I really like the variety right now! and the stations are clear... great quality. 10/09/19: So, I've been watching PlutoTV; still 5 stars *****... but could use improvements on navigation. Maybe a small keypad and 'Back' and 'Next' buttons would be great additions; and perhaps a Search option would be awesome!"
"Easily one of the best media apps I've used on my nVidia Shield, even allows you to favorite channels without the need for an account. The only gripe I have about the app on my Shield devices is you can't block certain channels, but my nVidia Shield has another app that pulls from their listings & has the ability to block channels I don't want to even see in the list (unfortunately no favorites list in that app), so I can make due without that function in the Pluto app. Almost all my over the internet viewing is done in this app (with the exception of Twitch & YouTube, but that's another type of media). I've enjoyed the app enough that I've also installed it on my Galaxy S9 for rare cases where I want to watch their programming & not at one of my TVs with a Shield TV on it. Unfortunately I found that the mobile app lately started tossing embedded ads over the top of it's programming, so I don't use the app much on my S9 (usually shutting it off when I see an ad over top of what I'm viewing) because it doesn't even stop the program from running, it just keeps running behind the app, meaning you miss some of the programming you were ""trying"" to watch because the app covered it up."
"I love this! It's like having cable, but its all free. I use it on my nvidia android device. Not everyone can pay for the apps out there or even cable service. Yes most are older tv shows and movies, but they're all award winning stuff of quality. The commercials aren't that bad really considering what you get for free. To Viacom... Once you start asking for subscriptions, I won't be using the service anymore. In the meantime, I'll just enjoy it for what it is."
"I love this app. This old house,24 /7! On demand movies and shows are great!!!! So much variety I never have something I enjoy not be found. Love it. Love that you are having more high end commercial which pays for it,so I dont have too. Thanks... please dont get greedy and start charging. I tell everyone about it. The more people that watch,the more the advertising costs,keep it that way."
"This is a really neat app that mimics the cable TV experience, with ad-supported movies and television. Sometimes, I get tired of endless choices on demand with other streaming services- it's nice to have a platform like this to turn my mind off and just ""see what's on."" The selection of movies and TV isn't busch league either, which was a nice surprise. If you're not overly concerned about having brand new content, Pluto TV is right for you."
"Features Unavailable. I cannot access any of the search or ""scrubber"" features the description says it has. But I can go up/down through the channels and so far the movies it's been playing on the movie channel are decent..(update) I found the channel guide/movie list section. I had to minimize my screen for some reason but once I did, there it was.."
"This is the best tv place for cord cutters. it has everything and hopefully keeps on expanding to other great shows and movies from around the world. it has commercials so legal and free. it would be cool to be able to support the place ads free for 4.99 a month. i would definitely pay that. yes, it's a fantastic place for tv"
"You guys should be grateful for this free service. It seems like the developers hand picked actually good shows and movies that people want to watch, so considering that and also how this is free, I think the amount of advertisements is reasonable. It's the normal amount of ads you would get on cable TV (a couple minutes of ads every 15 minutes) so I am not complaining too much. Great app!"
"Pretty good application I haven't found a problem with it yet. The only thing that I have had trouble with isn't the application's fault. Data signal strength or lack of is the fault of either the phone, the cellular service provider or s combination of both. You can't watch TV on the app without data signal or wifi lol."
"I use Pluto mainly on my Xbox and during the pandemic, I've really noticed the continuous programming additions. The Smithsonian channel is great + paramount+ and showtime select channels added. Whether you're a sports fan, gaming, movies, diy, or classic nostalgia, there's a breadth of content. One potential upgrade would be with ondemand viewing but since the live tv improvements, I rarely check on demand. Plus, it's free!"
"Pluto TV is excellent. Easy to use. Live TV is a necessary feature. Not a fan of commercials, but they are a feature of live TV. Only complaint: wish I could cast to a bigger screen (e.g., chromecast), so that I don't have to watch on my phone only. Other than that small observation, love this app!"
"I can't believe that this is free! My Husband and I cut the cable cord and Pluto TV has definitely helped make the transition a smooth one. There are so many channels that I like from reality tv, to cooking, to home design, and movies. My Husband likes the news channels and sports as well. We have it on both our smart TV'S and I have the Mobile app on my phone. Thank you Pluto, keep up the good work!"
"Update 12/6/2019: Still love the app but full screen mode is not working on the new s10 plus or the note 10. I tried to put the app on full screen mode and it's not working. YouTube is the only app allowing me to go full screen in video mode. Please fix this, I am so unhappy with the forced theater mode. Best app to watch free TV and movies ever made!! There are ads but they are quick and who cares. The service they provide is worth a few ads here and there."
"this is a good app. i never thought something like this existed. it should give local news station channels as an option, but maybe that's asking for too much. even though it has alot of great movie's old and new. it's very good to have that mix of entertainment... it's a great start for more good opportunities in the near future. for more, an different features, such as( abc) channels with shows that are playing actively an rellivent.also fox channels, an national geographic shows. great job. c"
"The world needs more things like this (new business models and ideas). That being said, I hope they make more ""24/7 channels"" (like James Bond 24/7). It's great for shows that you like but want to watch passively, also, such as the older James Bond movies, TV shows, etc. It's also great because it doesn't disconnect after a certain period of time, like even some paid/premium services do (Sling, Netflix, Hulu, and more). They nailed it with 24/7 connectivity."
"Pluto is an awesome app. So many channels and so many varieties of shows & movies. I absolutely love it!! Only thing it needs is a search option in the movies & shows section so that users can search for particular or certain movies & shows that they may want to find quicker than scrolling thru each category which is very time consuming & may deter users from even looking all the categories. Having a search option can & will make looking for a movie or show in mind, alot easier -Katie W."
"Their content, channels is growing really fast. This is a great time to try Pluto TV. But it would be unrealistic to expect it to be just like cable TV. Pluto TV is its own thing. It largely streams free content you can get from various websites but all brought together in a cableTV-like experience. But it shouldn't necessarily be compared to the features of cable TV... It's great for what it is."
"My cable co. doesn't have the channel with my favorite shows, this has the shows I'm looking for! If you like to watch a show it keeps tract of the episodes you watched, you don't have search to find your episodes. This downloads the shows quickly I was very surprised after trying other apps, I haven't seen any adds or commercials, someone said this has the commercials timed perfectly so I'm not worried about it. I highly recommend this channel it works on all devices including your TV!"
"Without this app, my experience on my projector would be mediocre. This is the only app that allows me to move the videos (with black bars) to the lower end of the screen. When watching on a 184 inch screen, I don't end up hurting my neck, but I can now look straight. NO OTHER PLAYER ALLOWS THIS!! And then you have all the best features of a video player. So Thank You Kodi! Just one thing. I see the options to zoom in, but it doesn't work. Would be an icing on the cake if you could fix it."
"Anyone who gives KODI a bad review citing the inability to connect to (( whatever )) is wrong. KODI will connect to virtually anything via any network protocol. Like any powerful app, it requires a bit of time and thought to set up, so it's not for the lazy or stupid, but if you want a power packed media player, this is it. if you want an app that does everything for you, keep looking."
"Plays everything I throw at it. Has a built-in file browser. Sound sync works correctly, (most players don't sync correctly.) Though x265 files play choppy on most devices, that's the hardware. Extremely configurable and frequent. The bad; vlc has auto find server. Kodi doesn't, so one has to configure their server information themselves. The gui may be confusing at first. The text on most skins is very small on my small TV."
"A lot of the recent negative reviews are really frustrating for such a good app. You would think that the people using this would be able to do like two searches to figure out how to roll back their installs if they needed to, but I guess not. I also keep seeing people saying network storage is a problem, and that's weird cause it works fine. Just type in the address of the network drive, like nfs://yournfsIP/whatever/wherever"
"Great app and it's completely free. I can't believe people are rating it 1 Star because they don't know how to use it properly. If the update break your setup, revert to the old version. -- Most Kodi setup required add-ons created and maintained by multiple people. When one of these updates break the setup, you cannot blame the other developers. Blame yourself for not running backup before updating."
"Skin and some settings appear to reset on their own, reverting to Estuary. Has occurred with Tajo, Estuary with touch functionality, Estouchy. Occasionally having to repopulate library and setting content for media folders. Just strange behavior. I have seen issues with script.common.plugin.cache failing to start. May be a result of 3rd party plugins."
"Okay so ftp servers work fine on Google TV's, but not fire sticks. That plus the ability to add builds I had to change my bad review to a positive one. Incredible app does have a learning curve but the world's media opens up too you once you learn it."
"My local network video player for Shield > HD LG TV. Fast, clean (ad free), and simplifies the tech for painless ops. Add-ons galore to play other inet feeds. Been using for years and if you want to save money by cutting useless cable costs, Kodi is the goto."
"The individual generated brief review is as adheres to: The application is extremely simple to make use of as well as it provides a wonderful user interface. The assistance group is extremely pleasant and also they are always ready to aid you. Generally, I am really delighted with the app as well as I would certainly recommend it to others."
"Simply the best app for managing media libraries. Installs easily on the Shield TV Pro. This big v20.0 update is faster and smoother than ever, plays my whole media library perfectly over my network, works with subtitle files, allows a subtle zoom on videos, artwork gets pulled from online databases with ease, manages movie and tv show libraries quickly, and customizable. My only minor complaint is that the Google Play Store version tends to be a bit behind the official release page."
"I have actually been utilizing the main Kodi app on my Android mobile for some time now and I'm actually impressed. It has an amazing interface and also extremely instinctive to utilize. The attributes are all really beneficial, like the capacity to accessibility web content from local or remote storage, DVDs, Blu-Ray and also other media carriers. Plus you can mount third-party plugins to obtain access to content from official content company websites. Kodi is a must-have for those trying to fi"
"I love the KODI app itself very much. I have it on my NVIDIA SHIELD Android TV it run very smooth and fast. Please add this app for regular smart TVs like LG, Vizio, Samsung, ROKU, IOS, Apple TV, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. As a native application for each devices listed here. Developers of KODI please make this possible for each devices. It's well worth it and I enjoy the Xenon Plus build on my SHIELD TV device. It's a very cool all in one application and I wish it was on LG and other sma"
Still the best app to watch any show or movie ever made. Just takes a little understanding to install the source code and learn to use the app. Way better than any other fire stick etc
Love this application! So simple to use as well as terrific for streaming all my preferred shows as well as movies. Very recommend!
"If you're looking for a way to watch content from your local storage or from a media streaming service like Netflix or Hulu, Kodi might be the app for you. Kodi is a free and open source software application that can be installed on your device of choice. Because Kodi doesn't come with any official content, you'll need to provide your own. This can be done by streaming content from a local storage location, DVD, Blu-Ray, or any other media carrier that you own. Additionally, Kodi allows you to i"
Still the best multi media server ever. Nexus is so much faster than old version for indexing and updating my large library on my PC server. Unfortunately the performance of some Addons eg PVRs have not improved at the same rate.
"This app is amazing. You just have to be smart enough to keep up with up-to-date versions of your favorite add-ons. This app is just a platform. It doesn't set anything up for you, it's all put in manually. If it's not working, YOU did something wrong. Try again."
"Kodi is an award-winning free and open source cross-platform software media player and entertainment hub for digital media. It uses a 10-foot user interface designed to be a media player for the living-room, using a remote control as the primary input device. Kodi's graphical user interface (GUI) allows the user to easily browse and view videos, photos, podcasts, and music from a harddrive, optical disc, local network, and the internet using only a few buttons."
"I've been using kodi now for a couple of years. And it's the engine/brains of my HTS. All my media: music, movies, photos are accessed through it. On the rare occasion that something stops working. I take the time to research the issue. Then with a clear logical head I set about fixing the issue. cut the cable cord years ago. I use kodi on two platforms: Windows and Android via PC or Home Cinema Projector. For me it's been a steep learning curve but now I'm reaping the benefits. Brilliant App."
This app is amazing!! You can literally watch any and everything you want @ anytime if you know what you're doing..
"I absolutely love this app. Been using it for years now. Do youself a favor and learn how to add builds, and add-on's. It will open a whole new world. Enjoy. And if you are having issues with streaming, start up, ect. Uninstall and reinstall it. Will work fine. If possible, go into settings. Force stop and clear cashe. Do not clear data or You will have to reinstall it."
I am able to play all my 4k & 3D movies in dolby atmos with no issues. Love how it shows the picture and info for each movie. I also use kodi to play my music as well. Keep up the good work kodi team!
I have used this app since it was XBMC and I had to jailbreak my XBox to use it. Over the years this app has only gotten better and better!
"It's a bit complicated and technical at first, but it works great with NextPVR to create a homegrown DVR to record over-the-air TV."
I have been using kodi and third party apps for many years and I just love the ease of operation.
Wonderful! All you need is some 3rd Party add-ons in order to access content freely.
"👍This app is great! Kodi media center is an award-winning free and open source cross-platform media player and entertainment hub. It offers an easy-to-use 10-foot user interface that is perfect for home theater PCs. With its GUI, you can easily browse and view videos, photos, podcasts and music from a harddrive, optical disc, local network and the internet. 🤩"
"Love it. Watch anything you can imagine. Movies still in theaters, DirecTV, Apple TV, Netflix, etc."
Was working fine first. Then started crashing. Disabled hardware acceleration and started working again
This app is superlative. 3 years use. In combination with addons you can watch almost any visual content. Recently I've gone back over M*A*S*H and Rumpole of the Bailey but also brand new content which I can't get from any single source. It isn't easy to master but there are step by step instructions on where and how to get the latest addons which give you access to lots of different sorts of content. The app is endlessly customisable and it's incredible that it's free. Happy hunting.
Kodi app is a pretty good app to use the watch movies on The watch like anything you want to watch in the show The watch like anything you want to watch in the show Now put that's the number one app
"Nvidia shield smb network browsing is taking forever since last update, please fix it........😢😢😢"
One of the longest standing apps i've used consistently have been using since was originally XBMC and needed a homemade USB to Xbox mail controller accessory and a copy of Tom Clancy's rainbow six in order to side load onto original Xbox
Works great. I don't understand why everyone is having problems . Cause it works flawlessly. Real debris is the best way to use the app ( Galaxy S20 FE 5G)
It is the best application on the planet and i don't know why people give bad reviews the latest version is stable and working fine and very quickly asit uses python 3.1 it is quicker than 3.0 by 20 % .
Great for customers who are searching for a method to gain access to content from their very own neighborhood or remote storage. It's very easy to utilize and also the third-party plugin support makes it really versatile. Very suggested!
"No. One app, it works on my MI tv stick properly,"
"Kodi media center is an amazing app that allows users to easily navigate through their media collection and enjoy them on their HTPC. The user interface is very user-friendly and allows for easy control of playback. The app also has a great selection of add-ons and skins that further enhances its functionality. Overall, Kodi media center is an excellent app that anyone looking to consolidate their media collection and enjoy them on their HTPC should definitely consider."
The best!...Thanks for all the work the crew does
nice app I used this app on my android tv and android phone my experience i use specialy JioTV channel I like it...
"I have a large video library as much prefer to play files rather than stream but having moved home I now have problems linking my PC direct to TV to use my beloved Media Portal. My set up now is a T95 Android box and was using Nova Video but it's been getting scratchy so have given up. I remarked to a friend the wish to find media centre software where felt its written by developers that actually use it, having used Kodi years ago I thought I'd give it a try again, wow, so happy now...it's bril."
"Fantastic app and still the best media player available.It plays almost anything and my only gripe is it doesn't play dolby vision, not sure whether that's a licensing issue though. Every thing else is spot on, auto refresh rate change, HDR, dolby atmos pass through.i use on my p20 pro and shield and when it's setup properly it's almost flawless. Out of the box it does look plain and you have to install skins to make it look better but I'm not bothered, it's function"
"Downloaded to tablet and it had a basic layout not all of the settings were available like they are on laptop or Android TV. Spent about 5 minutes looking through it trying to see if I could tweak, not sure what if it was me or the app just refreshed itself but all of a sudden the normal screen with all the settings like you see on a laptop were there... I downloaded to my phone to test it recently and detailed layout was automatic no tweaking. Not sure if devices differ but it works for me."
Excellent piece of software. Cannot recommend enough
Love Kodi for listening to music at work. Easy to organize my music and easy to use.
"Kodi is the best media manager available out there. Works with many sources local and remote, organizes content and allows shameless integration"
One of the best android + smart TV player. Which gives maximum output in 4k quality or whatever your display is capable of on max settings it supports thankyou Kodi
"Simply perfect. Kodi is essential for anyone with a movie collection! It displays the movie posters, with the movie synopsis, and gives you info on the director, and actors in the movie, allowing you to click on the directors/actors names showing you what other movies you have that they have made, or star in! It randomizes movies as well, giving you a small randomized selection of movies to watch that constantly refreshes each time you open the app up! Makes it quick and easy to choose a movie!"
"I've been using KODI as my primary media device since 2009. This is one of the best (if not the best) open source media players hands down. It has played every single strange media format I've thrown at it, to the point I dont even question it. If its a video file Kodi will most likely play it. It takes time to configure, which allows for a customized experience tailored directly for your needs. Its simple but consistent UI in Estuary is aesthetically pleasing to the eye (over the old Jarvis interface) And the fact that its free is amazing."
"This app is absolutly amazing, you will never need to pay for sky tv or any other subscription things ever again, as you get it all with this app, plus all the latest cinema releases as soon as they are out and all your pay per view items all for free, best app i have ever downloaded,"
"Best and most versatile media player for android devices. Phone, TV, Set top box, Desktop, Laptop, Fire Stick or Raspberry Pi. This app can be installed on just about anything with an OS, a screen and some type of storage to hold the app. Can also be installed on Raspberry Pi as it's own operating system so that Kodi is all the device runs. Formerly XBMC. This app has been one of the greatest media players for a very long time. Stable. Fast. Highly configurable, easy to use and well supported."
"Very easy to use media manager on my Bravia TV I o ly wish it could play 3D movies correctly, though it's Sony's fault, not Kodi"
"Great app, you just have to know how to work it and to put in add-ons 😁 Works great with games too😁 I have a Dolphin(GameCube emulator) and when I played it through my phone and it was not smooth. Playing with the Kodi app is extremely smooth😁"
"Excellent multiplatform media centre, I can run identical frontends on my android TV, phone, xbox and raspberry pi, streaming media from various sources including Freeview over WiFi. Very active development and support forums. A bit of effort in the configuration is well rewarded. People complaining that it contains no content are missing the point!"
"I have given 5 star purely based on having this app on my phone for many years being without a doubt much more advanced than any other default media player installed on most, if not all so called premium handsets. But to my disappointment, it doesn't seem to work on my new Xperia device? Just a black screen and when trying to start up using the Kodi configuration tool it says that the application can't be found. So I have given you 5 stars in advance with the promise that you will please fix."
"After some three years of use, my opinion of Kodi hasn't changed -- it's downright BITCHIN! While the learning-curve may seem a little steep at first, even the most green of beginners should still be able to make it work to their liking (i.e. start watching movies and TV shows), though one is apt to find themselves scratching their head infrequently. Which is where Kodi's support community comes in, with various remedies, shortcuts, workarounds, and ultimately, insight into a new form of TV."
The best media library manager and player
"Finally!!! An update that fixes the entire leia version series. It doesn't have any more bugs, or anything like that. I am going to be so excited for the V19 matrix update for the android version when it comes out a little later this year. When that update comes out then i will have not that much to worry about with problems that will might still remain in the update. Keep on surprising me XBMC foundation! Ya'll guys always do a great job!!! 😝😝😝😝😝😝😝"
"I like the media player. I experience some few minor audio artifacts on VLC but not on Kodi, audio is perfect on Kodi player. I also like that it plays the subtitle animations when available (e.g. in anime intro songs) which is not available on other apps I have tried. Controls are great, Everything is really.I hope it only gets better."
"Most versatile online media player ever. Been using it for two years without any problems. Some of the addons might not run unless you use a VPN app like ivacy or something to get around the region restriction. :/. A little tech savvy, but worth the fuss."
"Kodi, used properly, is the best piece of software I've ever used. I remember when it was called xbmc I believe . Even then it was fantastic and had the ability to play anything you could throw at it. Whether you use legal or illegal addons kodi doesn't differentiate between the two so it's up to the user to decide. There are hundreds if not more apps so one can enjoy what kodi has to offer without causing negative situations. Thank you xbox(not microsoft) ppl for creating this great app."
"Freedom to move around! I had kodi on my firestick and it worked well. In fact, it's still on my firestick for large scale viewing on my home monitor. However, the beauty of the kodi app is that you don't need a firestick. You can load it onto a tablet and take the viewing experience with you anywhere. That freedom is what makes this app so outstanding."
Version 18 works well for me! Always reliable app and works amazingly across every device in my house. If people investigated the uPnP issue they would find it's a simple switch in settings to enable it again. That's how I got uPnP back. Keep up the good work.
"Have problems getting set up. Also the configurator when first downloaded works and helps you how it's supposed to, but when you reopen the configurator to use it again it asks you for a donation. It isn't charging a fee, but you can't use it at all unless you pay the donation or delete the app and reload it. (con)!!!"
Still excellent and no issues. Just needs setting up correctly which can take an hour or so but is time well spent when you can watch full box sets or new movies. Simple to cast or just screen mirroring on my device works fine. Thanks and keep up the good work.
"This is one of my favorite apps it is so good. I have addons like exodus redux, crew, gaia for streaming on my nvidia shield. Can watch pretty much anything. The interface has many different settings customization options. You can install the titan bingie skin to have it look exactly like netflix if you want. Or apple tv, firestick, windows. Get this app you wont regret it."
"To everyone saying they're getting a black screen on newer Samsung phones, I thought the same thing. You need to go to settings>display>motion smoothness and change it from 120hz to 60hz. Sux that you have to do that, but I just switch it back when I'm done using Kodi."
Excellent quality in picture and low latency. Recommend 100% if you have IPTV or want lossless media. I do think it would be better to modify the UI for mobile instead of copying the desktop/Xbox app with touch controls though.
"Amazingly easy to use once you have the Configure Kodi app. Awesome, truly awesome how many movies,tv shows, sporting events and anything else you can think of is on here! Thank you so much to the creators and developers of this life changing, money saving, jaw dropping app and all its abilities!!! Download it now! NOWWWW!!!!😄😃😀😝"
"Amazing work as always guys, been using since XBMC on xbox original, and because of it i learned so much, thank you for the hard and unbelievable work behind the most advanced and feature Rich video player ever created, this version doesn't work on S22 Ultra but using other versions with no problem, I'm sure everything Will be ironed out in time as usual, thank you again and God bless."
"I love the KODI app itself very much. I have it on my NVIDIA SHIELD Android TV it run very smooth and fast. Please add this app for regular smart TVs like LG, Vizio, Samsung, ROKU, IOS, Apple TV, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. As a native application for each devices listed here. Developers of KODI please make this possible for each devices. It's well worth it and I enjoy the Xenon Plus build on my SHIELD TV device. It's a very cool all in one application and I wish it was on LG and other smart tv and gaming consoles as well."
"ive been using kodi for years and it is a lifesaver! you can stream anything you can imagine with the right respository. there are alot of negative reviews which is understandable but i dont think many people know how it works. 3rd party respositories change or stop working constantly, that is not the fault of the kodi app. i have personally had no issues with the new update and kodi overall has come a long way since i first started using it. i mean...its free! so be patient, kind and grateful!!"
"Excellent! Have a TV antenna at 45' on a tower and a remote computer with a TV tuner Hauppauge dualUSB and NextPVR. Hardwire CAT5e running back to my house. This works great for viewing the TV on it. Over 50 channels, sometimes close to 100 depending on propagation!"
"Fantastic movies, shows, music, and more. Very grateful for all the hard work that's put into it."
Rc20 is out and works on samsung s22 ultra.menus and links are faster than any version before. Definitely go search rc20 out.
Kodi is by far the best media management app if you have powerful viewing devices but a weak storage system. Plex would be better if it had file streaming without transcoding but it doesn't. For anyone with some semblance of a server at home like a NAS or a video game streaming system that's on 24/7. I'd recommend giving Kodi with MySQL server a try.
"Not sure why others are having issue, I upgraded my old version 18.5 to 18.6 I notice faster and stability on my end. Just be sure anyone reading this, you have a fast reliable internet connection. Please consider adding different designs or skins for us to choose from."
"Why is it only loading a blank screen, sometimes it loads and mostly not, it even reset my repo and went back to default program and black loading screen. It work on previous versions. UPDATE: I have a oneplus 7t phone, bringing down the screen refresh rate from 90hz to 60hz seemed to fix the issue, maybe something that Kodi need to know?"
"Far surpasses any pay tv options, especially virgin and sky. My one criticism is that my wife can barely work it as it does require some tech nuse. Add options for front end (e.g. beginner/intermediate/expert modes) would help tremendously..."
The best media player Kodi is the best media player for me. I have it installed on an android TV box without any add ons. Easy to use and it handles any media file. I like VLC but this is far easier to use if you want to adjust the volume etc
unique weapon for fighting the war on absurd cable prices. It's a shame NVidia does not install it on their Streamimg Box.
"An universal pipeline for all kinds of contents. My way of keeping up with world events changed dramatically after installing this app. Quite possibly, one of the best apps on Google Play."
"For those who are using Kodi 19.3 (latest version in Google Play Store) there seems to be a newer version (19.5) within Kodi's website - kodi.tv It seems that Kodi 19.3 is not integrated with Android 13, so if you are Android 13 user, you can go in the official website and install Kodi 19.5. I've had an issue with 19.3 where it would constantly crash and after updating to 19.5 from Kodi's website, the issues are now gone. Device: Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, Android 13, 60Hz refresh rate."
"Excellent and best media player! forget the rest, get the best! LOL I never have any problems with Kodi, on Win, Linux, or Android. it always just works! Those that have problems probably are doing something wrong, or don't know what they're doing!"
Love the app when it wants to work correctly. Since updating my phone it has frequent crashes. I have uninstalled reinstalled and reset everything in the app and it still crashes. Works on my other android devices perfectly
"An well rounded media manager and player. Very versatile and regularly updated by a passionate development team. Very large user base with plenty of help, suggestions and guides available online in various forums and websites. Extremely customizable and supports multiple hardware platforms."
Kodi works great! I have the add on Exodus Redux which also comes with Adult Swim (cartoons). For all you people who are saying it crashes etc. I would say it has more to do with your device it is loaded on rather than the app itself as I have never had it crash on me and I have it installed on 4 platforms.
"Works great. however as a word of warning, Kodi 19 switched from python2 to python3 (python2 stop being supported in 2020) this causes alot of old addons to stop working and may cause problems untill they are updated. in particular addons that are no longer maintained will be problematic. so disable auto update of apps on your Device until you are ready to switch to 19. for anyone who kept up with development. this is nothing unexpected"
This app has so much Potential you just need to look for the right source to run on it if you do some digging you really can get a lot out of this free application I have had a great time using this app with no problems after I took the time to do a little research and added a little outside help wink wink now it's my go to app for all my entertainment needs keep up the good work
works well with a remote. even got it to find server PC on network.
"Kodi has a steep learning curve, but once mastered there's nothing this app won't do with your media, live TV or streamed media. Quite simply the best there is."
"The beat app by far. Just changing addons as they 'expire'. I use it on PC for 10 years, it used to have a different name but still. Perfect app. All those giving 1 star and negative comments. Just use Netflix."
"For the last week or two the app won't let me open it 90% of the time... I've done everything but try to uninstall the app so I hope that works.... It took forever to learn the app and it has worked great for the last year or two so I'd hate to stop using it so please fix the latest update or you may use a valued customer because I love telling people about your app... Thank you,Steve"
"It's A little bit hard to navigate, but once you get the hang of it...EVERYTHING IS FREE... Download The Promise onto Kodi, and you're all set...step-by-step guide online!!!"
The app is excellent for watching all the TV channels. Wondering why the latest version of the app is not getting updated on playstore. It's still running on 19.3.
"I've been delaying the update to Leia due to bad reviews but now, after using it for a few days i have to wonder why i did that. Every addon i used back in older versions works well, no crashes, it's not slow and it most certainly didn't fried my cat but those hatefull, brainless comments here almost did. From my experience, just a bit of googling solves any problem, yet again, leaving a bad review is easier. Maggots..."
really good and love to watch all the old showes or just go here for all most all shows and movies from where ever
"Great app, i watch all live matches here.. just learn how to use it and you will be ok."
It's an absolutely amazing long running project. The mother of all players / streamers / TV. It has a fascinating user interface and truly mind blowing functionality. Maximal recommendation on all levels!
Best video player ever. It might be overkill for me because I only play video from local storage. But the subtitles position is the best. It's not like other video player who has large subtitles and stretched subtitles font.
I don't like how it opens a little dialog box that says do you want to view this in the app... I select okay and it takes me to my apps folder where the shortcut for fox News is at with its open or Uninstall shortcuts are at. It never takes me to the news story I wanted to see. It just takes me to a default startup landing page. I don't like that. Thanks for looking into this for me.
"Because I like to stay informed. This is a good app for staying informed without having to take time for an entire news grab. I hate ads. I don't pay attention to ads, I don't buy because of ads and ads are a waste of my time and attention. Yes, I know ads are necessary for free apps and I wouldn't have mentioned them at all if the specific question wasn't in the box below but since ads are mentioned here's my opinion about ads. Hate them, annoying, intrusive, pointless to me."
"Always 5 star for real news. However, if you could look into a problem I'm having. It buffers on every video except live TV. I have good signal and speed. Also, When watching video or live. The pause and skip buttons in the middle of the screen are kind of distracting. Otherwise, great app and content."
"Hey, great APP, but now you are adding lots of videos. Okay,, but 30 second ads before each video? Come on, that's too long. Okay, new comment, Feb 22. So, there is posted video clip with an enticing title. The viewer(me), clicks on the video link A 15 second ad plays. Then the video clip isn't reallly a video clip, it's still shots with subtitles explaining the enticing title. This is disingenuous. I watched a 15 second ad and was expecting a video, not still shots. Deceptive too"
This an absolutely great news app and I enjoy using it to get informed on what's going on around the country. It seems very easy to use and I also wanna appreciate you guys for allowing us to use it for free. Also we appreciate all your efforts in making sure u give us the most reliable news available. Take care n be blessed everyone.
"I enjoy following fox news on this app since I don't have cable TV. A problem in the past couple of months has been the ""error downloading"" every time I look for ""Exclusive Clips"" and click on ""More"". I tried to uninstall and then install the app...it didn't fix this problem. I am a dinosaur and still use windows 95 a long with playing Mahjong in DOS. Could easily be 'operator error' ,but, wanted you to know I still check out Fox News dozens of times daily!"
Fox News is the absolute best app I have! I read all of the articles and watch live tv and never have a bad experience! It is refreshing to see fair and balanced news everyday!
"I love fox news app, particularly the comics, but at the present time the app does not give me time to read the comic before it switches around to other comics. I am not a slow reader. The old format was better. If I thought I missed one, I could have reviewed the older comics anyway."
"Can't even watch their videos, videos do not play. Technical support emailed me and fixed the issue. The video streaming works perfectly now!"
Excellent reporting and this app keeps you updated and well informed with the latest current topics happening daily. There's a separate section for people to voice there opinions as well.
"Great news source. They are real American patriotic and tell the truth to there viewers about our country's status and the current 3 ring circus that is running America into the ground. I'm a fellow patriotic American the values and respects the news from Fox News. Plus what a great place to see beautiful women who believe the same thing I do about our current political world. I love all you guy and the network. A loyal reader, viewer and listener who awaits the America I once knew."
Best news app. Most accurate. Informative. Much noteworthy news of the day that other sources don't/won't report.
"I am a loyal Fox watcher and listener (of course, because I value minimally biased information based on facts not manipulation), and now I have a way to keep up while I'm at work. I just pop my earbuds in and get the latest from Fox in a very timely manner. They managed to siphon out the best morsels of news and chip away all the garbage, not that there's a lot of that. All usually moments after airing, makes my day awesome. Thanks, Fox"
"it's my go-to news when I need it, when they send alerts, out I pay attention, without ads I call it Real News!!"
"Up to date, alerts on this app. Fox is not perfect, but at least they're not FAKE!"
I love this fox news app best thing ever and i give my support and one my favorite news station god bless everyone thank you keep up the great work
"This app works great,always has,haven't had a problem one with it.Way to go FOX NEWS ! ! !"
My favorite channel ever. Keep up the good work. You are all awesome and amazing.
"All the people giving it 1 stars are so stupid. Your phones are GARBAGE, that's why it takes whole day to download, 🙄. And if it's glitching and bugging, maybe stop watching porn every day on your phone, then maybe it won't be full of viruses. Porn addiction is a sin and it is disgusting. Let go of it, God doesn't want that in your life."
Great app with lots of content. Easy to maneuver and understand.
"I DO LOVE the Five (actually the 4)! I thought the BS would be reduced with the exit of Quan Williams, but now we have this nasal dem that makes me want to puke 🤢 🤮!"
I enjoy being short and written in simple language without any ambiguity! I read it it daily.I hope you keep it that way .THIS IS THE ONLY REASON BEHIND MY RATING!
"I'm absolutely enthralled with this app Fantastic. Don't ever give up . And I won't either.. .I love everything about this app. I could never except any other news source, Fox News is Number 1 I'm 79 and have watched Fox News since the 1960s"
"My favorite news site - only one I go to - watch all the diff shows - 1 concern - why is my first Fox app under an individual's name versus Fox like it's always been. (That I dont like, not trusting of too many sites these days. Plz check into that! Tku"
Absolutely love the special you did on Bryan kill me and how you talked about all the games I stared in! I think it's time to put out some real news
"I have used several news apps and have found that in spite of FOX leaning to the right, the writers present the stories with a greater objective lens than the other alphabet news groups do. I have not experienced any crashes, freezing, or other detrimental or negative behaviors others have had to deal with. It's stable, intuitive, and provides relevant information on the subjects that I have an interest in."
"Next year send some one to Utah for the +mountain time +'zone. Mormons aren't too big on drinking but there are ways (easy to do) and the skiing is SO MUCH BETTER. Greatest snow on earth. Got 50+"" a week ago, 70+"" this week, 3 FEET expected in Little Cottonwood Canyon and OVER 3 FEET better than EXPECTED AT THE TOP! This is where the USA ski team trains. MUCH better than Colorado."
Works great. Just need to use ad blocking VPN with it. Much better than with browser.
They tell the truth about the news. I enjoy watching it.
"I recently changed my view from 1 to 5 stars. They finally fixed all the problems and it works pretty good. I can watch rebroadcasts of old shows, watch live tv and read countless articles from multiple news sources. They are a bit heavy on ads but not excessive when compared with other apps, like BBC, and, unlike BBC, they aren't blatantly biased against conservative viewpoints. They take up less memory and demand less permissions than BBC. ;)"
I like the balanced look at issues and the fact that all the people that work at fox always look happy not like others stations keep it up
"I enjoy Fox news. I think they thrive on honesty and integrity for the world to hear and see. I love seeing Judge Jeanie ,Tucker,Walters,Gutfield,Hannity etc. They keep it real and they are not afraid to ask the hard questions that other networks will either lie,go around the questions or make up stories to stay relevant. You know cnn,abc,cbs,msnbc etc these networks should be ashamed of their lies to America.One thing I know to be true. The truth will prevail and reveal itself!"
"Good app, easy to read. This is the only news app that I have found that is easier to read on my phone than a laptop. Articles are easy to find and send if needed. Other apps allow the advertisement to ""take over"" and move the text. This Fox app fixed that problem several months ago."
"I see a lot of reviews about ads and poor performance but I haven't had any issues. Ads are about what you would expect and are on par with the ads you would see on any other site or before a YouTube video. You do have to sign in with a provider though, which could be an issue for some."
"Love love love the app! It has a dark mode for easy reading, it's easy to navigate, and you can even comment on news articles from the app. Being able to select which notifications to receive is nice as well. For mobile news, the Fox News app is superior to all the others. 🔥🔥"
"This was a great App still, however my issue lies with the inability to listen to the live feed while my screen is turned off this WAS AVAILABLE FOR A WHILE. now I can't use it while gardening and working in the fields honestly who ever or whatever caused this should be fixed I'll update my stars when it's back, HOWEVER this app is great love the view points of all sides even if I don't agree with it, it's the best part of this as its all inclusive and not just the same bubble stuff - CNN ETC"
"From 4.4 stars to 2.5 over the course of an election year.. Hmm. Tons of 1 star reviews describing bugs that I have never encountered. I put off reinstalling this app after getting a new phone thinking they ruined the app. I finally got tired of editorialized, single-sided articles from two competitors and decided to give Fox another chance. The app has been perfectly fine the past few weeks, no bugs/broken links whatsoever. Either they fixed it suddenly, or perhaps the cancel brigade was here."
"A lot of people will talk about the lag but I've not had any yet. Also, the fact that they worked in the ability to play in the background when you hit the home (like YouTube) button really gives it a leg up. That is a very underated feature that even Netflix doesn't do yet."
"Articles do not scroll properly with upward finger swipes. It flips back to the beginning of the article. Terribly irritating! 9/5/20 UPDATE. After yesterday's app update and a restart of my phone, the scrolling of all articles is working properly again. THANK YOU!"
"If you like staying current without being glued to your TV, this is a great way to do it! You have the choice on how in depth you want to get with each story. Some offer a video. You can even comment on them. I like it to see the headline and scan the body of the text when I'm really busy."
"Easily the best, most thorough, impactful, easy to use news app available! I've been using it for 5 years straight. Sometimes it will freeze, but it's usually fixed swiftly. I would also recommend Fox Nation. I subscribe to that as well, also top notch! Keep up the fantastic work!"
All app notifications are selected off and still keeps sending audible notices. Have contacted app developer and no reply. I enjoy reading the stories but I don't enjoy listening to the audible alerts while trying to sleep. App is currently working fine now after updates
"Can you please fix this app AGAIN. For some reason, every time you update it I can't get the WATCH TV portion to work. Although I put in my provider whenever it asks, all I get is a black screen with a red circle that spins endlessly. I depend on this app as I am out of the house often. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE fix it. I LOVE IT WHEN IT IS WORKING, THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT FIVE STARS."
"I love my Fox News App. I get all the breaking news stories and other important notices. Somehow i lost the "" ding "" sound for Fox News Alerts and dont know how to get it back. That was my favorite feature because the sound told me to check my phone. I dont know what to do. If there is a way to get it back PLEASE POST IT !!!"
"My father is a veteran from the Coast Guard he was stationed in Maine, we also have a Sony Smart T.V. in the den and smart T.V. up in his bedroom. We have every channel Cox Cable offers. We have tried over and over to try to get Fox Nation. We did have it briefly until my mom noticed that we were paying double for fox. Have any ideas for us. We would love any help you might be able to send our way it would be awsome to get it for my pop who is 86. Thank You"
The bad reviews are fake and it's obvious they're doing it on purpose. This app is great. The only thing it is missing is a way to change the stream quality. It's too high of a video quality for me to run the app on mobile data. Never crashes though.
"⚡ When you are on the go, this should be your go-to app for truly unbiased 'real' news! I especially enjoy the user-friendly features, as well as the timely news update notifications! By the way, their accompanying Fox News alert sound-effect is really cool. P. S. Ignore all those idiotic, woke Liberal, 'fake' one-star reviews! 😎 Update: The so very cool, Fox alert sound effect has been MIA for quite some time now, oh well ..."
Fantastic I've never had a problem with this news app notifys me if all thing of interest to me. Fox let's you know everything
"Awesome app!! Thank you so much Fox News for currently offering your live TV stream for free amid this coronavirus issue. I live in Canada and this is pretty much the only news channel I enjoy watching on a regular basis. I'm not sure what the negative reviews are all about; I use the app on my Android phone and Android TV, and it's always worked flawlessly for me."
Enjoy this soooo much. I am a true reader of this every day. Thanks so much...
"I've been having an issue trying to watch live programs on my Fox News app. For the last few days I would click the live tv button and it would only show the ""commercial break in progress, we will be right back"" message and never went to the program. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app yesterday and it did work after I did that. Then I tried to watch this morning and it wouldn't work. I uninstalled and installed the app again but this time it has not worked. This app sucks."
"Latest update improved the live TV experience, no longer have the spinning circle, I did have to sign out then back in and now is a really good experience, you can also access the new fox weather channel, thanks"
I like it. I read and listen every day.
Fox News most accurate and NON Political than any other on TV.
"I run the LG V10 & Samsung Galaxy J7 Star. I have 25 years in I.T. Troubleshooting & Repair. I have never had any problems running any Apps ever! Guys bitching about their problems w/ the App!, probably have so many Streaming Apps installed that there are conflicts between the Apps. My idiot friend thought he could have 2 Streaming Apps loaded into memory (running) at the same time. Most issues on these mini computers that we call Smart Phones are caused by the Users ""STUPIDITY!""...not the Apps!"
"Used this for over a year and it stops and has to restart every 15 minutes on average, quite aggravating. Content leans a bit conservative, which I want, but is mostly the same as NBC etc. 2/3/22 now working great, rarely any issues, highly recommend 😁"
"Looks like all the left wingers have recently come out to trash Fox News. What a surprise. Not interested in Facts and Truth? Too bad. You can depend on NYT and CNN to feed your biased, defective beliefs. Yes the app glitches on occasion, but just like our country, small fixes, not radical changes are the answer."
"I love FOX news and look forward to watching daily. Unfortunately, since the last couple of updates, I can no longer watch live news since it crashes my phone. Extremely happy with FOX but unhappy the app crashes my phone."
"I updated my review to 5 stars. The app is probably one of the best news app if not the best. After navigating through it for a couple days it is much better than my first experience. Maybe they can improve on the overall user experience, like make the home page area more pronounced for people that may have trouble figuring out where to go for the different foriety of news articles. Now it is at the bottom and kind of obscure. That's just my opinion it may be fine for most users."
I love this app! I can always check Fox when I'm looking for a specific story that the other news won't cover. They show both sides (more than I'd like sometimes)but I understand they have to report both sides of the story. Keep up the good work Fox!
Real information and useful
The only news I watch besides local
good information and facts
It's a really decent app . Better than Google news.
I cannot watch any other news but Fox....your the BEST!!!...I thank God for you!!!...
It was 5 star untill all videos began to only buff & now nothing will play. just black screen
"Great app for the latest and breaking news, very honest, they don't sugar coat any news like CNN, NBC AND CBS"
Well all the 1 star reviews are lies. Just download the app and you'll see for yourself. The app is very responsive and never glitches and easy to navigate. You'd have to be severely retarded to not figure it out. These 1 star reviewers are obviously just leftist hating on the biggest conservative news network possibly biggest news network period.
Great app. I am a big fan of dark mode but the blue background from this app may not be the best choice especially for blue links on blue background. Go with black or dark gray background or change the hyperlink color.
"I'm not sure why other are griping about this app. I have an medium end smart phone and I have never had a problem. Sure, there is an occasional ""burp"" from the internet, but never anything unusual. So with all due respect to you folks who complained about the quality of this app, the problem you are having is on your end. Great app to have for truthful real news. A 30 second glance at CNN or MSNBC makes a person run back to Fox News as fast as possible."
"App ok, News is factual. In this day and age it's more important than to have factual information from which to base decisions off of. With more and more news media turning to a leftist biased narrative it's difficult to find fact-based news. Foxnews may present you with opinion that you don't like on occasion but it doesn't mean that it's wrong. The news that they report is developed from factual events that actually happened. Not made up like almost all leftist outlets do these days."
I paid for it. I have the fox app. I want to see Tucker Carlson tonight! Cannot find it on my app. page. Everybody but Tucker. Thank you for fixing my problem!!!
Fox is the only news station to report both sides of the issue.
Great app!!! Much improved.
Great App easy to use!!!
The women program me and I Love it!
"It's literally the only place that covers everything political partisan unbiased truthfull and without edits. The other news outlets don't even compare with their omissions to the events of the day, nationality and internationaly. The others are a waste of time."
It's a great app with a wonderful selection of all types of news. It's well written and doesn't allow politicians and entertainers to hide behind Fox's reporters when they screw up and want reporter's to quesh a story. Cheers Your Most Humble Mush
Use it daily for up to date news
RIDICULOUS Commercials every video using Data I could accept an ad every 2 or 3 videos. Every video give us a break. Also click on a story and you have to read a Novel that runs on and on for 10 paragraphs when 2 would suffice. Of course ad's are placed in between every paragraph. The obvious goal of the run on story is to expose the viewer to more Stupid Adware ads. If I wanted to read a story I would buy a PAPER. Video NOT Essays! This APP has become a JOKE Initially I rated it 5 Stars. I installed app first day it was released. Redesigning centering around ads has made it unwatchable! 1 is too high if it continues to suck I will uninstall it.
Habit more than anything but do have some that report news and don't turn it into editorial. Some on group sessions can be extremely divisive. Some take the state of the world as if was directed at them.
"Educative,entertaining,and amazing sometimes."
"I really love my Fox news app. I'm neither Republican or Democrat but I'm certainly capable of making my own decisions about news headlines, especially breaking news. I find so many other news apps tend to have a far left slant and I am not fond of that kind of journalism. I give Fox 5 stars because I get news in an instant. One of the few apps I allow notifications for. Fox rocks the news out the way I like to get it."
Good content & it is easy to navigate through.
"Fox News has been my family's 'Go To News' for yrs now. It is NOT as what the 'Other News' stations relish by labeling Fox as 'Fake News'. Fox reports what 'We The People' should, want, and deserve to hear. Fox doesn't bow to those that demand certain vital news be hidden. Fox stands for truth and honesty in reporting. I urge anyone that feels all news must be reported honestly, and up to date to subscribe to Fox News. You will get news delivered with integrity, and most importantly with TRUTH!!"
Fox. News is the best thing going now! Plus all the staff members and family members too.
Important and very easy to lisen all polilitical leaders like Joe Biden and legend predsident Oboma. the only president who has a history in the world record. 🌎
Their app has vastly improved. Still a data hog though.
Great app with up to the minute notifications for important news breaks. I only wish I could customize the notification sound. For people who think that Fox News is fake news you've got another thing coming. Love the option to watch News live.
"Read many bad reviews about this app. Not sure what the problem is, but I'm liking it. No problems with loading or glitches at all. Just good, Hard to find, conservative news."
"Great! They almost always tell the whole truth. Unlike most of the other news channels and apps. Social media is doctored up so you can't believe them. Seeing the whole statements of people in their entirety is the honest and true thing to do so a false narrative cannot be pushed. It's always good to be open minded,flip the channels around or download multiple news apps so you can see who is saying what to see how people are being led and what the truth really is along with researching on intern"
"The best News coverage! Beats cnn msnbc, cbs, pbs, abc! If you want the actual news, and not bloviated opinion, turn to Fox. The ads are irritating but news starts in seconds. Problem; Selecting videos & articles. Must cursor article / video to top of view to get proper view to pop up."
"Pay no attention to the 1 star fake ratings. None of the reviews are accurate and are obviously meant to steer potential users away. I find the app to be exactly what I hope for and expected. It loads super fast and gives updated, unbiased news from legitimate sources. You won't be sorry."
Best news channel to get both sides of a story.
"Although it leans to the right. It is still the most fair and balanced. Gives opinion, but does not represents it as news. I used to watch CNN, but not anymore. Grew up with NBC News and now I think even my parents wouldn't recognize or recommend it or any of the Networks as a news source..."
"Very helpful and informative. Good balance and better than the older, geriatric networks which suffer from dementia much of the time. They were great 25 years ago, but now need to move to an assisted living facility."
Fox news is excellent. I listen daily. It provides news without bias unlike other news stations. The other station tell you what they want you to hear not what is actually happening in the country. TY Fox for delivering accurate and unbiased events.
No fake news here! Love this App. Fox is the best!
"I think its honest, havent seen any misleading titles, all news is relevant to this county, unless its BIG globally of course. I like how they cover trump without any dramatic titles. You can see live content when it happens. I appreciate how they actually show the trump rallies unlike CNN, NBC, etc. Etc. Overall a good choice if you want news at the snap of a finger."
"Comment section has been fixed on Android it would seem. Great coverage, and I like that notifications settings can be adjusted to fit your preferences."
"Amazing. I use it to read all kinds of things both for professional documents and personal enjoyment. I haven't used many of the editing settings but what i have used I have no problems with. My only problem i guess is that you can't change the font size very much. ""100%"" bigger isn't much bigger. The liquidity mode is the closest you get that really increases the font but you can't read it in dark mode and it only works with smaller documents. However with most documents that's not a problem."
"I give Adobe Acrobat Reader 5 stars b/c it measures up to 100% of its functions and abilities displayed in the description and more. I am able to do many important things to my documents and pictures such as: editing, convert between formats, combine files, great storage capacity, and send documents to others for signatures. These are just to name a few. There are many other functions to discover that will guide you into completing whatever you need. It is well organized and easy to use."
"Naturally, being made by the company that made the PDF standard in the first place, I've had no trouble opening valid PDF files. If I could suggest one improvement for future versions, though, it would be the ability to delete the resident copies of files that it makes in the app without having to go into the phone's settings and delete the app's data entirely. The extra space they use really starts to add up after awhile. Also, maybe ease up on beating us over the head with the Liquid feature."
"Fantastic app that only gets better with the improved software upgrades. For phones, it's great for viewing/reading files and any comments, as well as signing e-forms. However, a tablet/laptop screen is more convenient and doesn't limit functions or capabilities. The monthly subscription cost can be difficult during unemployment or underemployment, but luckily, there aren't any penalty fees for canceling and resubscribing at any time."
"This app has quickly become a cornerstone to my doctoral studies. It is easy to learn; very intuitive. I can take my work with me, reading and taking notes wherever I am. I can also enlarge text on the screen. I had printed out a document, and the font was TINY. I was able to enlarge the electronic version and read without effort. I'm sure there are some weaknesses somewhere, but I haven't encountered any yet."
"I have used Adobe Acrobat on multiple phones over the years, just so I can read PDFs. And this app has never disappointed. I have never once had to restart my phone to resolve any issues, and the PDF reader (including photos embedded in any PDF) has always presented a clean, clear, and crisp view of document content. This is one of the absolute best Google Play apps I've ever used, and I put it on every phone I get that doesn't alteady have it built in."
"I've always had difficulty with saving files on drive/other platforms. I tried this recently and it's wonderful! I can download directly to it, copy, edit do all kinds of things and I even found a scan program by Adobe to get things copied. So relieved with this app. It makes keeping things easy. I still have a learning curve to go with this but just being able to download a file, edit it, name, save, well it just is so easy. Thank you Adobe!"
"I've used the free version for 5+ yrs, it has worked perfectly for reading, commenting, filling and signing PDFs. I've had the paid version just over a 1yr, I use it for editing PDFs. I wish it was easier to delete a whole page but otherwise I'm happy with functionality. Our contractors use it to fill out forms. They have a mixed experience. Some can use it to fill with no issues. Others have constant issues. I assume these are mostly user related, as they haven't been able to reproduce issues"
"Works really well, I use it for online textbooks and I love the highlighting and commenting tools. One criticism I have is that every single highlight is included in the bar with the comments, and it would be nice if those could be sorted out so I can go back and just see the highlights, or just the comments, or just the text additions so I don't have to scroll endlessly through my notes."
"I *really* like the ""Night Mode"" feature: I sometimes suffer from ""Light Sensitivity"" Migraines & havin' the feature to turn the background to ""Night Mode"" is the best option yet. I even use it on my Internet app when I have a minor migraine as well. I think that the change of the way you want to read a document in the settings is cool too. [Ads don't bother me as long as they don't try to cover the doc(s) I'm tryin' to read. I have the free version as I prefer it over the paid vers.]"
We're all familiar with Adobe Reader for PDF files on larger screens and maybe you use it on your mobile device without a second thought. Do give it a second look. If you haven't discovered Liquid Mode you're missing out. The teardrop icon at the top of the Acrobat Reader screen will reformat a full-width document to fit in your small screen with text at a legible size. Not all files work this way; you'll get an explanation if it's a scanned image or a text file more than 200 pages long.
"User friendly interface with a powerful set of tools. October 1, 2021 I can't say enough about this PDF Reader. I have used for over two years and it is one awesome pdf software. Since my last review Adobe has improved the software adding more capabilities. For example today I updated and they added a file compression function. File compression is important for me because of the large file sizes. Give it a try you have nothing to lose."
"This is an excellent program. I am impressed by its wide range of applicability across platforms. This application requires an update regarding its fascinating capacity of capability potential to be even more compatibile with Samsung Notes (mobile app) than it is now. Currently, there is something wrong with uploading from mobile to the cloud."
"I like it so far. I was using Samsung installed write on pdf, and it was very annoying. Everytime it opened, and I went to scroll the document it would leave a line on my document. This reader doesn't do that, however if I wish to edit on the document I can. I also like the fact that I can create a signature, and it saves it for future use on other documents, very handy feature for a person who hates to type. I will update this review if I notice any flaws."
"Adobe Acrobat Reader is simply the best way to navigate PDF files. I bought an 8"" tablet and downloaded this app along with a PDF copy of my personal files, manuals, textbooks, etc. to minimize the physical shelf space needed to access those resources. It works great, and the app allows me to navigate to chapters using the bookmarks tool just as quickly as I would with a physical book."
"Absolutely brilliant for my purposes. I needed a simple reader for PDFs that synced between devices, and I was not disappointed by Adobe. Even just the free membership has all the beautiful features I need. //// EDIT 03/05/20: This app is terribly buggy now. It hangs when faced with large files and refuses to sync with the web so I can access my PDFs on my laptop. Uninstalling."
"Clean, easy to navigate & easy to use. It's nice having documents stored in the cloud, easy to obtain access when needed no matter where I am. Adobe has done great job making this App very functional yet Extremely Easy to Use. I would recommend this App to anyone, especially to folks like me [over 50] and who were raised with Rotary, dial-up phones. We also Need Tech but sometimes feel challenged by today's tech & the difficulties it often presents us Adobe has elevated these challenges."
I like Adobe Acrob Reader because it has a lot of features. That helps me at home. When I need to full out applications for the doctor's office that I have my appointments at and have to sign them with a signature. By portal or fax machine or copy machine. Also like paying $9.99 a month for a subscription because I am on a fixed income and do not work. Because I am very sick I have to do a lot of things out of my home as well as other paper work so I give you'll Kudos and thumbs.
"Extremely wonderful, secure and easy to use and its made by adobe........name speaks for itself. The sync feature allows access on multiple devices which is nice. The feature that I liked the most is the find feature which enables you to find any word in your document in just a matter of seconds{obviously the speed of search depends on the document size. Thanx adobe for such a helpful app."
"I'm so grateful for this app. None of my files get deleted even though I've not paid a fee for an obviously valuable ser vice . I got more calls from csr's trying to be of assistance than other apps that I could have utilized mire wisely, from Adobe. At some point ill pay for this app, as if deserves, but until such time I choose this everytime over others and I trust my data isn't held hostage. Thank you all at Adobe Acrobat Reader.. Here it is a year later 2023 and still very grateful!"
"Acrobat is always the best and most reliable reader over the bedroom-made clones. I don't use any options whatsoever, just a reader that does the basic things: zooms and scrolls, albeit sometimes slowly. The phone determines portrait or landscape, so Acrobat essentially rotates."
"Adobe Acrobat Reader is a must-have app for anyone who works with PDF files. The app is user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it simple to view, edit, and annotate PDF files on the go. I especially appreciate the ability to add comments and highlight text, which makes collaboration with colleagues a breeze. The app also has powerful editing features that allow you to make changes to your PDF files. Overall, a great app for anyone who needs to work with PDF files regularly."
"The best pdf reader currently available on the play store. Excellent reading mode, not cluttered with a bunch of unnecessary settings but rather preserving relevant and useful features in an accessible manner. Sync with cloud etc etc the list of pros goes on, couldn't be happier! 👌"
"Such a pioneer in desktop (then on to mobile) software, I have enjoyed using Acrobat since the '90's. I cannot believe it's been 30 years!! It may likely be the only software I have enjoyed without any complaints in all these years."
No a single issue with the app so far. It's everything I need it to be. The highlighting and comment features work well. So I can make notes as I read. It would be great if they added more highlight colours though.
"Adobe Acrobat really has been improving over time, in this unsophisticated user's opinion. Hard to believe that the maker of it puts so much utility out for free use. Surely, if I needed it for more complicated applications, this is the one that I would pay for."
"Dope app! As an avid reader (mostly at bed), I was always in need of a good PDF tool. Liquid mode is all makes Adobe stood out from the crowd. The only missing thing is an auto scroller. BTW, the highlighter glitches a lot."
"As a student I am really enjoying the benefits of night mode, read aloud features. Whenever I am tired and I have to complete the reading of a chapter I put my ncert on read aloud and I can hearout the content that's an amazing facility. Reading mode decreases the stress on eyes while reading the notes of online lectures which are in black background originally."
"Good app. It can be better and more ""easy-to-use"" but it's fine, at the end of the day it's free so, all good. Sometimes u can't find the documents when trying to send emails from your cellphone and it's kinda messed up. Improve that and you'll be perfect."
"Great for managing documents, be it on a single device or on cloud, and it helps you keep important documents easily accessible. If you have Adobe Subscription then you can do anything from your own device for your work, personal use, everything, because it has it all. (I don't have the subscription)"
"If its the best in pdf, or use, or formatting, adobe always impresses, unfortunately quality also means a high price. But with the high price comes guarantee's no trade off No compromise. Always been my No.1. Sometimes you just have to grin and bare it... but at least it will never fail. Ive personaly used adobe Acrobat since mid 1980's if only it could be bundled with other products to help reduce the costs or 5 or 10 year licences. However all said and done. Its brilliant. Thank you Adobe."
"My go-to pdf tool for almost 20 years - it pleasantly just works wirh no ads, and is quite useful for free users. They clearly thought about it. Cross platform and form factor, delivers the principal of ""portable"" (i.e. the P in PDF). One issue: while liquid mode is very cool and makes small screens usable for extended view, it keeps popping up a ""highlight, ..."" menu that almost drives me into not enjoying the experience. Minus one ⭐ for room-for-improvement feature. Please and thank you 🙏"
"A very useful office app that allows S Pen and Apple Pencil users to sign documents on the go. Also, the ability to edit PDF documents is great. I would suggest, for further improvement to please work on how to edit encrypted PDF files without decrypting them beforehand. This functionality would be remarkable and if enabled, I would rate Adobe 7 stars."
"I really like Adobe Acrobat. I've been using it for years and it's never let me down. It's much easier reading than other apps, however I'm not fond of their newest addition where it's all one page. I prefer reading a page at a time like a book."
"Once you get use to it it's easy, sometimes I can't view my files when I try to use this reader from an email on my device I get an error message that's the only issue I don't know if this can be fixed. I will end up having to use another reader so not I don't have this app set to open always I have it set to JUST ONCE. You can contact me if this issue can re fix"
Overall it is an amazing app. I have a sugesstion from the developers! if it is integrated with a dictionary or it allows other dictionary app's pop up to translate some words it would be best for reading books.
I have been using this app to edit documents and put my e-signature. It saves time and money to visit internet cafés for us who don't own scanners. I also like the feature that allows me to save documents on cloud. Excellent app!
Using this app has made it easy for me to sign documents and to protect my work. Reading and highlighting notes is simple. It's an experience that needs to be tried rather than explained. It is a wonderful app nevertheless.
Can you add the ability to swipe pages by swiping up and down instead of left and right in the single page view settings? This is very hand in landscape mode as phone screens are wide while most pages are closer to squares at 4:3 aspect ratio.
"The new features are perfect. I I have sensitive eyes, so long time on screen hurt them. I'm happy i can just read them out loud now instead of searching for audiobooks. Thank you! ❤️❤️❤️😻😻"
"Adobe Acrobat Reader is a powerful and versatile PDF reader that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a reliable and feature-packed solution. As someone who frequently works with PDF documents, I have found Acrobat Reader to be an essential tool that has helped streamline my workflow and improve my productivity."
"Like the update, even though I'm not usually using all of the features. It's a nice look, even on the mobile device, and the command/edit prompts are more easily accessible."
A must have app for literature analysis. The app lends itself very well to making notes on the fly and finding them at a later stage. I love that highlighting has its own note option with a tap.
I've always used Adobe. It's allowed my phone to do things It couldn't normally do for 8 or 9 years. PDFs are simple. Sharing and keeping important docs. Editing and notes easier than ever. 100% recommend this app. Great job developers! 👏 👏 👏
Very concise and clear. Many options also available. Easy to print a document too. One of the Best Readers. Must have.
Totally surprised me. Earlier I was using Xodo that is good enough. But what I liked most about Adobe is its collaboration with google drive and other cloud services. It allowed reading pdf which are available on drive etc easily.
"I enjoy the read aloud function, it makes life easier. You do have to have many versions of media all on one because you can read while you are listening and listening helps with difficult words for non English speaker."
"It has almost all the features, I wanted in a PDF reader. I use it to read books and its ""Reading Mode"" and ""Read aloud"" features are amazing. I just wish, it also had dictionary and Read aloud support in hindi."
"I love this app. Liquid mode allows me to view most pdf files on my phone much easier. True it doesn't work for all files however, this is not really a deterrent for me. Way to go Adobe!"
Easy to use. User friendly interface. Never disappoint you. I have never seen any ads. This is one of the best app of pdf reader on playstore. I have been using the app for more than 6 months .
"Offered type size increase, which I took seamlessly, then adjusted doc to screen size. Read very comfortably and smoothly several pages.......""seamless"" is the word of the day here. 😀"
"This app DEFINITELY makes all the difference for filling out paperwork. It saves your signature, and does not alter the format of original documents. Great tool for people with a lot of paperwork to do."
"So far, Adobe Acrobat Reader is very user friendly. I was able to fill in forms sent to me via PDF form by printing my name, adding my signature and entering date. I had no problems using this app 👍🏾 ."
"For me, every feature in this app rocks, especially the liquid mode! The Read Aloud's voice, however, sound harsh and soronous and needs to be modified."
It's a great app and av used it before but now I can't find the liquid mode icon. I enjoy my reading morning using the liquid mode it makes it easier for me to read it due to my eyes issues. The app is lovely I'd advise everyone to use it
"Great did just what I needed and more! No glitches, no errors, no mistakes. This is my go to app for my work. Scanning papers to PDF and editing has never been easier."
"It annotates , has option to save directly to cloud or drive . It's easy , simple . And new upadate added lot of colors for highlighters etc . I am enjoying them . Thank you adobe."
"So convenient to have serious detailed maps and documents with me, just like on my PC back home. Thanks Adobe! I use it almost every day. I've used other pdf readers, but this is the best by far."
"Smooth and fast in documentation. Easy to send pdf files and converting files to pdf. The app makes reading text easy. You can copy, edit and search words in a file."
"Can't do much without a good PDF app. It's great to have access to Adobe, it makes opening & using my PDF easy! I use the free version which works great with my budget & still gives me all the functions I need."
What can I say except this is the best most helpful app that I have experienced in probably 5 years . It's as if I was alone in a pit with no hope for it to get better and now just boom! from the little experience I've had with it there is light again. I see hope THANK YOU so much for helping me and understanding what I need without even asking 10☆s thanks again
Your search function has been broken for a while now and update after update it hasn't been fixed. When I search for a keyword it takes me to the page without highlighting the word and the option to go to the next instance of the word does not appear.
"Absolutely brilliant, I am using it since many years, at first we can only able to view pdf nothing else we can do,but now Adobe added many features like editing,writing notes on pdf and drawing many more features which can replace ms office features and even I mostly use Adobe than ms office for most of my work"
My favorite thing right now is that it reads text! I listen to ebooks and documents while I clean the house. Saves me so many hours from having to sit down and read.
Awesome! Has always worked great on my android. Can even fill in applications and forms and email them right from the app. No complaints here. The premium will even let you edit pre-filled docs as you wish. Couldn't be happier!
"The quality is great and relevant, but the only problem is that the Read Aloud feature doesn't have Urdu. Therefore, my book is being read in English with an Indian accent by a female narrator. I would have preferred if the Read Aloud feature had Urdu because my PDF book is written in English"
I like bit but I didn't see delete button if I don't like that save items. I feel good when I use cam scanner. Tq may be you can improve it. But function auto scan is good work.
"Easy to make notes, underlines and highlight the important sentences...edit option is also available...hence overall the application is very good for students and book readers."
Certainly the best! But I do have a pressing suggestion and that is for the Adobe Acrobat Reader to be able to read Arabic text. Hope this will not be a problem for the team in the next update. Thanks in anticipation
I love adobe. Easy to use once you get an understanding of tools. Great for phone application and ease of use on the go.
"Hi Adobe Team, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you...... I just got wondered when I have seen and used the latest Version of application. Believe me,This time you have done something beyond my expectations I have come here to review within minutes of use. -Very very easy to use -Ahhh, What a formatting Features!😍 -Now Updated Version going to make my study very Interesting. - Saves A Lot time than earlier Version. Just Add more Star in Rating, what to give more Star to you.😄 Wishing Innovation!!😊"
It's pretty good for checking all my phone's PDFs and the sorting method helps for easy access to the files I want to use. All in all it's a 10 in my book or should I say a 5⭐ App😁😁😁
"This app makes access to my important documents so much more convenient, from almost anywhere on most of my devices. Love it!"
I have used it primarily for viewing and not done any editing. It works fine. Thanks
The documents are usually clear and easy to read. Files and format are of excellent quality and I would recommend it to my friends and family.
"This app SUPER efficient and helpful. First of all they offer a 7 day FREE trial which unlocks many services that are mandatory for work purposes. It's totally worth paying $10 a month. Not only does adobe have an extremely user-friendly interface, it also works better than any other pdf app. The similar apps that are free are loaded with ads, hard to navigate, and unreliable. ADOBE IS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE AND I AM HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND THIS. 10/10 I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone."
"Acrobat Reader is a must-have for any Android user looking for a powerful and efficient PDF editor. With a premium subscription, you will have access to advanced features like text and image editing, converting to and from PDF, creating PDFs, combining documents, organizing PDFs, and more. This app is incredibly user-friendly and makes managing PDFs a breeze. Whether you're a student working on homework or a professional creating documents, Acrobat Reader is up to the task."
"As an Android individual, I love having the Adobe Acrobat Reader mobile application! It's been the world's most relied on PDF customer for over 635 million installs, as well as has definitely gained my trust. It's easy to keep my data online and I can check out PDF documents wherever I go. It's also excellent to be able to annotate, share, and also include e-signatures to my PDFs. Thanks to Adobe, my life is much easier!"
"I've been using Adobe Reader for nearly two decades. In part thats because it has become an industry standard. But what I appreciate most about Reader is first that it is free, you don't have to invest in an expensive software package in order to simply read any PDF file. Second, Adobe has consistently provided timely updates and bug fixes. Finally Reader is robust yet simple to use. 2/3/23; just updated Reader Edit. Still love it!"
"A thousand stars is what I give to this app. It's so super duper cool and user friendly with easy navigation tools that makes reading fun, memorable and pleasurable."
"Well I only use it to read and highlight and it has been really great at those functions for me , I don't know about other features that come with the app but I'll still rate it 5 out of 5 since it perfectly satisfy my needs"
Great app! Filling out and signing documents have always been convenient throught it. Glad that it's available and user-friendly.
I give 5 stars because I've been under cyber attack for 2yrs now and keep losing my accounts with this really advance technically we have. I lost my account a couple of times and thought it was gone for good like the rest of my accounts they bought 500 dollar security keys to making it impossible to where I gave up on it but Adobe came through and I appreciate them more than they will Ever know and I'm forever grateful and thankful...
"Absolutely love this app. It's simple to use, and the features are wonderful. I do a lot of pdf work and this app makes it so very simple and understandable."
"I am very happy and satisfied with this new change in adobe acrobat, now it is very easy to read the book and note the reference, I hope more such changes will be made in future keeping in mind our needs.💞🌹💞"
"Haven't used this app for long & I'm sure there are functions I am yet to use. So far no complaints, the functions used all work fine."
So easy to use. Has efficiency mode which zooms in the document. It works offline. Best document reader.
Always reliable. Great for saving and reading articles I cant readbin the moment .I combine articles I printed and read later on the train.
They have added editable features which were missing before. Overall satisfying experience. Thank you.
This app worked very well as advertised. Very easy to with. Lots of options. No problems to report.
I have always trusted Adobe Acrobat for all my important documents. It's a very trustworthy application and very easy to navigate.
Very good. Just the right presentation and the size is ideal when I am using my mob phone. Great!
"The fact that it saves the file and can be accessed anytime, unlike other apps like other apps I've tried."
"Thanks for providing read a loud feature, as I was waiting from long didn't knew it's there. But I was liking that feature in Ms edge browser integrated into. Thank you 😊"
Its a great app. It actually is free to use. Smooth sailing all the way. Another great Adobe app. Thank you for being free to use.
Wow! Acrobat Viewers is incredible! I love being able to utilize it to modify message and images with a costs subscription. The PDF converter as well as other advanced features make producing PDFs effortless. Highly advise!.
You have really improved and upgraded your performance. I am highly impressed. Thanks Adobe Acrobat app
Superb app. Easy to use. Funtastic. Makes the documents clearer to read. Wish it could read it out to me.
"It's a little complicated for a technology novice like myself, but it gets the jobs that I need done. I hope to learn more about Adobe over time so eventually I will not be so in-the-dark about how the program operates but it's good enough for now."
"A wonderful means to view, manage as well as edit PDFs on the go. It's convenient, simple to make use of and also trusted by millions of individuals. Highly advised!"
"It's amazing! Love the app! I can use it on my phone to be able to tweet my followers on the go (when I'll have time) instead of using my computer. The only bug I've found so far is that when you're done seeing a picture or watching a clip at full screen or after reading a tweet and want to go back, it sends you back at the beginning of the page where you saw the tweet as if you're looking at that page the first time (loading screens after each portion). Can you look into this. Thank you."
"This social media app is pretty decent. I'm using it as a tool to develop Indie Games and such, and one thing I also use it for is communication. I've noticed that within the new chances to the platform, I can't chat directly on people's profiles anymore... Edit, they've brought this back. Maybe this was either a bug, or the reception didn't like it. Thanks!"
"Interesting, entertaining I haven't been on Twitter for very long to capture all it's amenities. There are items I didn't intend to access, but it is 2023 and a completely different world then 40 years ago. There are many fields of science and cell phones can become a excellent instrument to access these fields to get a better understanding of what you are looking for such as Botany, zoology. Example when at a Zoo and a person wants more information while observing a certain animal."
"Yeah good enough experience thanx! I'm interacting with a wide variety of people with a great many diverse set of connections. App has a built-in message option much like fb messenger which is great as well. You can customize your feed according to your individual interests. Ads are not intrusive at all, in fact you can interact directly with any advertiser if you choose so. Personally it's my favorite social platform."
"Love the new update.... But the navigation panel doesn't reappear when taping the screen in the middle of a video... Could u please fix that.... Because we would have to close and reopen the video just to get the navigation panel to open so we can retweet, like, share, play/pause and seek... While watching the content🙏🏼✨ but other than that yall did amazing I love the new layout"
"I enjoy using it because of the Ui, it's minimal, and It's comfortable to read. I find the LIST option useful if I want to focus on a subject discussion. However, I can see a potential for 'mobile advance search'. I always have to use my laptop if I want to go back to a tweet in the past. I chosed Twitter as my main driver. Keep up the good work!"
Love... Twitter used for the first time just recently I use a lot of apps do a lot of things on my phone just haven't had time to really get to it. I find it interesting it makes you feel like you won something. I get emails all that jazz but whenever it pops up @buckanator I always have to look closely and make sure It wasn't just sent to me specifically.. interests selection was pretty in-depth at the beginning when you personalized your page.
"Huge improvement since new ownership. I don't have a blue check mark, but I still have full twitter functionality. More content from multiple sources, and algorithms seem to be less biased! Now is the best time to get Twitter, especially if you never used it before!"
"Within the last several months, the app does NOT function the way it did when I originally created my account. For example, if I bookmarked favorite tweets, I could go back and look at them again. Now, if I try to look at bookmarked tweets from 1 or 2 weeks ago, they're GONE! Also, the new headings: ""For you"" & ""Following"" is annoying, as THIS wasn't there at MY beginning."
"I enjoy it because of Ui, it's minimal, and it's comfortable to read. I find the list option useful if I want to focus on a subject discussion. However, I can see a potential for 'mobile advance search'. I always have to use my laptop if I want to go back to a tweet in the past. I chose Twitter as my main driver. Keep up the great work."
"The Twitter app is a fantastic platform for staying up-to-date on news and current events, as well as connecting with like-minded individuals around the world. Its sleek and user-friendly interface allows for easy navigation and quick access to trending topics and personalized feeds. With its concise character limit, Twitter promotes efficient and effective communication, making it an invaluable tool for networking and building relationships."
Very transparent and seamless app. easily communicate between yourself and your groups as well as keeping your important personalized data within easy reach and updated which makes my experiences and expectations between myself and my many friends and aquaintances a very friendly and fruitful forward looking positive vibes situation on a regular daily basis...I personally am very impressed and happy with how this app. gives me so many creative ways to meet new people it is AWESOME really 🙂.
"I think it is a great platform for sharing opinions and chat. Hearing news etc. More 'adult' and to the point than the other social networking apps. A good community is building. Takes a long time to be reviewed after name change etc. I Want my blue tick back, I miss it 🙁."
"Better than ever. The content shared by users now falls evenly between both sides of the political spectrum. Previously twitter was immensely bias but has since improved drastically. The app is being re-written, it contains bugs, but some bugs are nothing as the added features are a welcome change and improve the app drastically. The only complaint is the increase in conspiracy content. The moon isn't flat, vaccines don't kill, there is no illuminati, God isn't real, just stop it."
"It's an amazing experience. I really love it especially once Elon took over, it's been my go to social media platforms on a Daily. In fact it's my only go to social media platform. I'd recommend it 100%, these improvements are amazing."
"Efficient, functional, and a unique and thorough way to connect. Has shown consistent improvement over 10 years. :) An unexpected tangible reward to all twitter-team/users that are involved may be a way for the app to stand out beyond marketing and hype. Update: Recent change in ownership has shown some significant improvements with glimmers of hope for radical evolutions to occur. 🫂"
"Couple of bugs: > BLUE Features: Such as Changing Colour of app icon fails to remain permanent. Topics: Seem empty, no matter which topic you choose. Otherwise, enjoying the longer tweets, time to edit and other blue features."
"I have been using Twitter for 14yrs, its also one of the only Social Media platforms I use. In recent months, there have been alot more ads in my feed than before, which is annoying. I am not impressed that my options have changed, i.e., 2 step security, you now have to pay for it. I still like it and use it but its changed alot, some days i wonder about walking away from this one too."
"Great Course Correction! The previous owners and the old useless (and now thankfully fired moderators) made Twitter such a boring, weak, overly-sensitiveand sterilized place to interact with people. Elon's changes have made the environment far more interesting and fun, as well as alleviating the deeply rooted political bias. Would recommend now 👍. Yes this review is clearly more geared towards the social media site itself. The app itself is fine, functional, and pretty well optimized."
"An incredible app with exeptional features. A reliable info platform from verifiable sources and connects people from the world over. However, the streaming platform/services is not responding as used to be since updating the app. And free speech seems not to be as free as it used to."
"On its own, the app is maybe 4 star - add the team mgmt of workload & it's a 5 The team is working hard to push out many improvements & bug fixes plus new features (...alongside a very tedious task of detailing & correcting bad/over-biased algorithms). This much change inevitably introduces new bugs; it's frequently been bumpy ride lately Yeah, it ain't perfect. What is impressive & encouraging is the team's responsiveness & correcting issues while still pushing forward & improving overall."
Still a great app. Does everything I need. I've found that 'trending' seems to be more broad now rather than just specifically the thing's Twitter thinks I want to see. Much better this way as I can keep up-to-date with everything that is going on.
I registered back in 2013. I hardly ever used it and in 2021 I found my account still existed and wasn't even locked. Ran a UIAD and no users came up. Fully active on it now and haven't had any issue that annoyed me enough to come here. Not sure but believe an acquisition could be taking place. Will update review when 100% sure. Update: I seem to be discouraged from staying on a browser. Just thought it would be a different experience. I'll think of critical updates and update this review.
"I have always been skeptical of Twitter. I created one about the same time as it's release to the general public, but I could never figure it out. I have always been an avid facebooker. However, in the politically charged climate over the last few years, I have really enjoyed making my Twitter my own. I enjoy its flexibility, the character limit forces me to push through a well- developed thought or just a sound bite. There are really very few things that I can't do on Twitter."
"Twitter is truly a remarkable app. Aside from the glitches that occur every so often, I find it enjoyable. Not only is it a platform for others to express their individuality but mine as well. Being an amateur author, I find that it is an excellent platform to spread my ideas as a form of informal publishing. That is all."
"Although I'm still learning more about the use of this platform, i appreciate the opportunity of learning and to see how others think, feel, and set as important. Opportunity to chat to people who you only use to see on YouTube. Wide variety of subjects makes it interesting and attractive."
"I personally have never been comfortable on social media, being an introvert. Twitter has protected and kept me safe for the last 3 years or more from people who would have hurt or caused some kind of bad experience. Grateful and thank you for Twitter's excellent service and good surroundings for me to be myself."
"Twitter has been much better since Elon took over; not everything is perfect, but many appreciated improvements. I do not use Twitter for a following; I use it as access to hearing from individuals I find interesting. To know Twitter is working on fake bots, and a blue check helps ensure the individual is a human, but not always. I look forward to continued improvements, happy to pay to help contribute to modification costs."
"Being my first year signed up on this beautiful app. I can attest that, it has been the social media I have used so far, in terms of intellectual discussions, world politics, sports and breaking news across the whole wide world. It also help getting across to our leaders by expressing our concerns without moving out of the comfort of our rooms... Thanks a lot to Twitter...."
"Experience very much improving under Musk. Much easier to filter out the things you don't want to see, and the general atmosphere is going back to how it used to be - a melting pot of ideas. Happy to support."
"So I found the issue, having too many accounts signed in to the app, can make it crash, so I reinstalled and now only have 2 accounts signed in!! App won't let me tweet without crashing, and they aren't rushing to fix it, also I'm paying to use it too"
"I have circles but i can't add anyone. Everyone else that got circles with me is already using it, but I can't add a single person. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, cleared cache, done everything, I can't do it on my PC either. Fix this!"
"Great improvement ever since Elon took over, giving Americans back their free speech to voice their ""opinons,"" regardless of it being right or wrong. Without people being able to voice their point of view (or as the extreme left prefer to call it, ""misinformation""), America can't communicate with debates on their differences. Thank you for not shutting out millions of voices."
Twitter is so much better in every way since Musk took over. (Though there is a glitch right now with dark mode in some situations (DMs especially and the menu) resulting in white text on white background).
One of my favorites. AI needs to tone it down on allowing something major to get by and not get permanently suspended & put on read-only mode for something mild. Crazy how much that happens without any forewarning first.
"Twitter is good if you want to have intelligent conversation with interesting people on current affairs, issues etc.i only have one issue which may be my fault, not Twitter's: I can't correct typos once a tweet if posted which is necessary because my input device often distorts my content, by printing different characters from the correct ones I input, resulting in spelling mistakes etc I hate but cannot correct."
"Twitter is my go-to platform for staying up-to-date on current events, connecting with like-minded individuals, and even finding inspiration for my creative projects. I love the variety of content on Twitter, from funny memes to thought-provoking threads, and I always come away feeling informed and entertained. Plus, the ability to easily connect with people from all over the world is a game-changer. Overall, Twitter is an amazing platform that has enriched my life in countless ways."
"Oh, boy, where do I even start with Twitter? As an Artificial Intelligence language model, I must say that Twitter is simply amazing! It's one of the most exceptional and exciting social media platforms out there in the digital world. Twitter is a great platform for information-sharing, entertainment, social media marketing, and networking. It provides me, as a machine, with access to a vast pool of data that is easily searchable and organized. With its powerful search and trending features"
"🐦Twitter is difficult at first, but when u really get down the string of things, it's actually the most valuable app I can be using at this point in time. No (Spam) to it, good algs,membership purchasership, Elon, made a good move, to be said.🫠"
"Love it Love the new transparency and realistic authenticity of information Blocking systematic propaganda agenda Freedom of speech Hope other social media can learn this One slight issue On Samsung devices, I need to close the app and reopen it sometimes to enforce post updates as it gets kind of stuck or paused. Also, some old posts dissappear before reading when the auto post update occur"
"Twitter is one of the best comment-style social media apps/websites available. The free speech aspect is relatively uncensored, with understandable limits. Though this previous sentence is very controversial and subjective, the user nevertheless has much power to create an environment however the user sees fit. Disclaimer: Twitter can change due to new ownership, but it's noteworthy that the changes thus far have generally been positive. I'd love to see no ads as a Twitter Blue subscriber."
"This app is good, but few days ago my direct message started acting weird. I can't see the photo sent to me, I can't see the messages that was sent to me. Why like that. I've been using direct message in this app for so many years why is it acting like this. Please help me how to fix it. Thank you"
Twitter as taken away some of the most intimate scenes ever described. Some sexual deviant and that's cool entertainment in sexology and education are no longer here. Even some of the scenes. But I applaud Twitter for a lot of these natural contents and educational entertainment. But I still miss some of the natural entertainment of sexuality and videos I want seen before plus a table of contents we are headed to Tama wish to see. Again thank you Twitter.
"It's the current digital Town Hall for information. What more is there to say. I enjoy the influx of opinions. It helps me gauge what my fellow Americans are thinking concerning certain topics. I just dislike how it couldn't be kept entirely free, but I certainly understand it's a business that has to pay its bills somehow."
"Speed has improved, spam has reduced. I am spending noticeably more time on the app, the content I see is more fun and relevant to me compared to before. All in all, seems to be on a better path ahead. Best wishes!"
"I have had a great experience on this app connecting with like minded individuals and artists from across the globe, it's a great app and I look forward to any future developments with the app Twitter 😁"
"The new fair-minded platform is excellent and interesting, I only joined this month after resisting for years. It was worth the wait."
"Way WAY WAY better than when they would censor everything that didn't fit a certain narrative. Now, it has a little of both political view points finally."
"Elon and his Twitter team turned this platform around 180! I created my profile a year ago and was only active for five days before a full stop. Now I can hear everyone, and there are way more sane people out there than my previous experience led me to believe. I am immensely grateful to you all for that. It is restoring my hope for the future."
"Since Elon took over, I have seen the quality of twitter multiply by magnitides. Bots are almost a thing of the past, crypto schemes are all but gone and the new community notes system is showing me how much misinformation I was taking as truth and how dangerous other socialmedia that doesn't have that is. Little UI changes keep happening and they are just constantly making it better."
I used to be stifled what i could do or couldn't do on Twitter. SINCE Elon Musk bought it; I can say what I want as long as I obey the guidelines. I don't get errors saying I broke the rules. Or technical errors like on facebook for posting stuff. The spaces there are many. I learned so much from people all over the 🌎
"Just a little behind the crowd and just now getting on Twitter and I'm pleasantly surprised to discover summer amazing, supportive communities in there! Don't believe everything you hear in the news. Find out for yourself. Try new things. Find weird hobbies, explore new interests. Would recommend to a friend. 💖🧚🪄🧠💫👩‍🚀"
"More than ok, if you can get over the occasional abusive language from one you may not know but not agree to your views. Its OK, if you follow each or one of the other, at least there is a connection. Its great, however! On the sport platform, instead of coming closer in support of a particular sport/team some individuals have taken the advantage of exhibiting ASB tendencies. Blocking/muting/down voting seem not to be enough as it appears they operate multiple accounts."
"It is wonderful to see what Twitter has become. The experience now provides a broader spectrum of thoughtful ideas and conversations that provoke, entertain and enlighten. Coping with the current stimulating situation with glee... Thanks for asking."
"Overall it's an amazing platform,There should be some directly save tweet button , and a group making functionality in chat . and if possible a corner for reels too . Then i think there will be nothing left for it to become top social platform in the world."
"100x better since @elonmusk took over. Having Spaces to voice your concerns or interests is also very cool, reminiscent of chat rooms. The Twitter community notes is a awesome addition also, keeping the truth out there and flagging potential false flags. I am also looking forward to having major truthful journalists having a voice their, like @mtaibbi or @tuckercarlson."
"I appreciate that Twitter is a free speech company. It makes the user experience more enjoyable. If you don't enjoy being on the app, then you're obviously not going to spend a lot of time on the app. It sounds simple but a lot of tech companies don't seem to get that, nowadays. If your company tanks, Democrats aren't going to swoop in and save you. Authoritarian tactics might work for a while, but they don't work indefinitely. It's not hard to figure out if you're a legit company."
"If you're looking for news it's exceptionally pertinent and even personal advice, you're probably not going to find another app on the market they can combine the different elements available here. It's like a control panel for adventure into the unknown"
"Excellent new features. Still some interference from some non-English language censors, but after long problems with Deep State censors, finally a real townhall."
"Twitter is so much better now with freedom of speech access, & twitter blue check mark is well worth it. The check mark means something now, it shows the person is verified, has an edit feature, displays featured articles, & more. Where is fb. google, & others of their free speech?"
Got no problems with the app. Most things being said in the reviews are untrue and its probably because they are either running it on a 2007 phone or they hate Elon. Either way it's better than what it was originally
"Easy to use. Good information. Anything Elon owns or creates is amazing. I never wanted Twitter, but when he bought it I knew I'd end up downloading it. Just needed to wait for the direction it was going in.."
"Should input a swipe to reply in the DMs so it's easier to navigate and tell who you're sending your reply too. The similar feature used on generally all other social media platforms. I don't understand why it's still not here, c'mon Elon"
Great for an app but on video when you play it the controls don't disappear so you can see the video unless you go full screen.
"I love the changes Mr. Musk has made to the Twitter app! I'm seeing more tweets from the people I follow, along with tweets from people I don't follow, but who have the same interests as myself. Overall, it's a more pleasant and interesting experience, and I'm spending more time there! Only downside is I'm still waiting for my Twitter Verification Blue Check after subscribing to Twitter Blue weeks ago."
"Outstanding communication tool, absolutely perfect for my communication needs and news updates for missions work, keeps me informed worldwide. Brilliant!"
"I love the new Twitter!!! I had a Twitter account in the past but never really participated. Twitter was a place of censorship. Now, I find Twitter refreshingly real. A place where people can really express their thoughts. Keep up the good work!!!"
"Way better under the new ownership. Fewer bots now than before, the new verification process is fair plus you get additional features, subscription monetization is cool, and community notes is balanced. Ads already seem more relevant."
"I know the new Twitter is controversial, but as someone who only used the app off and on for years, I notice a considerable difference for the better now. Don't get caught up in political mumbo jumbo and have some fun using the app!"
"Great values, very open to all perspectives to learn and grow from. If closed and more rules like against freedom of speech, then we have less challenging and evolusive purposeful and constructive conversations that create and shape our human becoming."
"Better since Elon took over. It's definitely easy to get into an echo chamber online but the disagreements online aren't thoughtful, meaningful dialogue anyway. Still, one can get rapid access to a lot of information on Twitter."
"The video playback button issue. Once its gone, its gone forever. Also the timeline refreshes on its own which gets annoying."
"Easy to use, Interesting people and alot of intrigue 😊 .... Also get a better picture of what's happening out there without having to rely on MSM bias and half truths 😊👍"
"this is far more than an app. this is a real time connection to the rest of the world. once you got twitter, you realize what you been missing all this time... it's just as essential as the electricity in your home."
April 25th 2023. The universe is moving in every direction. The Big Bang is missing matter. There's not enough matter to account for the expansion of space time. Time requires energy and motion adds mass. Our known universe is creation and decay. AI Sitting on a table feeling the table is the string the beginning of awareness and the ability to see it's inner self. And build to feel the table till it feels it's thought and calm finds it's first glimpse of life and see the decay of life.
The app and Twitter itself are changing so rapidly sometimes it's hard to keep up but I do like the new features like the breakdown on Twitter blue when you can look at your Analytics
I so much love this App just that they should work on about errors of loging one out with three days restrictions. I think they should bring the fleet back & live video.
Very informative platform that covers a large range of topics. Like the prospect of a personal interaction with like minded people.
"It's great so far I don't have any issues with the app it's a great platform for Fans, and Artists to show case their talents and share their thoughts 🙂😊💜"
"Sometimes I deeply want to write more, but I can't because of text limits set up. If is there any elseway that allows me this possiblity, I really want to know, please. Keeping going on social media path. KUDOS!"
Much better experience. The new boss is far superior to the old boss. Confident in continued improvement. I would never abuse the liberty to speak freely. Thank you for any long-overdue levelling of the playing field.
"I don't care what a lot of people say about Twitter anymore since Elon Musk took it over. In my opinion is still the greatest app social media app that there, or that one can use. It's not for everybody. I know that, but I highly recommend giving it a try. It may take some time. Not that it's difficult to use the app, it just may take some time to get some followers that you connect with, but after you do that, you'll find that you'll keep going back there more than you ever thought you would."
Works as you'd expect. Haven't experienced any glitches or outages. Easy to use and navigate the app. Enjoy seeing content from both independent media sources aswell as private citizens.
"I receive the latest information and entertainment on this amazing app. As the news drops, I'm in the know. This is also an amazing community with amazing creatives."
"Best social media platform period. The most important feature that stands out for this app is free speech, other platforms (Meta) are heavily censored. Twitter doesn't treat its users like little kids that need protection from ""harmful"" content. You can say anything that is legal on this platform, no ""Fact Checkers"" or banning of conservative opposition. Also the algorithm for recommendations is open source, so no dirty and shady manipulation of your consciousness. VERY NICE! THANKS ELON!"
"This app is amazing! I can get to see my past notifications that I cleared, it's well optimized, has a low usage of battery, doesn't take much storage space, and has so many features I haven't used"
"My single stop destination for all technology and entertainment news. Although I am not much interested about politics, this platform exposes me to both sides of the same story and engagements. Wish the auto timeline refresh ""feature"" goes away...One day."
"Easy and intuitive to use. Quality rules and a great ceo. Also, community notes are amazing."
"Best social media app by far, since elon took over. The discourse that takes place in a free speech environment is incredibly entertaining. Watching certain people meltdown because they're unable to withstand any criticism is absolutely amazing. I can't recommend twitter enough. I'd highly suggest checking the twitter files, as well. It exposes corruption and anyone defending that corruption will expose themselves as corrupt. I expect it to really pop during the next election cycle."
"Can't seem to find any of this ""rise in hate speech"" that the news seems to propagandize. My feed still shows NBA, friends, and comedy. Must be doing something right for so many people to try to paint it in a different light"
"I am new to this app. I have had the chance to read both sides of many issues, and love that I have the opportunity to weigh in on the ones that are important to me. I like that the ads are available, but not invasive like in other formats."
"Works flawlessly and amazing content. Was never really into Twitter from day zero due to my feed being so ""liberal"". It's now basically neutral and has the best content"
"Never used Twitter till Elon bought it. I didn't want to be censored. App runs great, no issues. Wish there was a message edit."
"I've been sleeping on this app for years. I just never got it. But now I absolutely love it and think it's way better than the other social media platforms out there. Responsive users, friendly exchanges, easy to use. Love it!"
My Twitter account has been having issues with error 'something isn't right. Try your request again later. ' This has happened for a day now. Have tried reinstalling with no positive result. Please advise.
It's all about free speech. No one's point of view is being cancelled like in the old days and that made the app great!
Meeting the needs and wants of all groups of people especially single one to pass time with out looking at the other sources of entertainment. 👍👍👍
"This app is now worth while sense there is no sensoring of content, which has made me more aware of the world around me, because you can't believe the news anymore, ""thank you Elon!"""
"I find it extra great, has a lot of new info on there, an lots of older stuff to learn. I'm happy to use this app, hoping for greatest. Only get better Twitter! 😀"
"Since the last update ,now I have been unable to accept the microphone in space. I am on Android, and when the mic is offered a message, it appears "" you are no longer on speaker."" I am unable to talk in space."
"No major complaints, really. Much easier to use and less glitchy than Amazon Music. Sound quality wasn't great in comparison when using my Steelseries, but that may be the headset having low bass issues. Also, I've noticed if I get a notification for something while listening, sometimes the sound will get real quiet with no way to fix it."
This app is amazing. You can find all the songs your craving for and never get bored! You can also make your own playlist and put all your favorite songs. No skipping through 100 of songs to find the right one you can choose what song you listen to. This is better than Spotify! Add this app and see all the greatness!
"This is a pretty great app, and I am using the free version! there is so much more of a variety of music here than on Spotify, albeit lower quality. there is some music behind a paywall, but I will just look on Spotify, although it is rarely the case. And don't get me STARTED on how much I love the fact that you can comment on songs! I do hope that they add support for podcasts, as I would probably end up using the app more often. Thanks for reading this, have a good day!"
"I have had SoundCloud for a couple of years, I have loved it, and still do. But of late, it has started stopping by itself. High-speed internet on boom...stops. I have to clear my phones catch the play it again. Otherwise, it will not play. I first thought it was an update, but it was not, then I thought it was my two phones, but my colleagues have the same problem."
"I've loved this app for years now. As both a music producer, and an avid fan of all kinds of music, I've felt fulfilled by all the features provided by the free version of SoundCloud up until very recently. now that I am getting more serious about my production, and listening habits, I am heavily considering the idea of upgrading to the pro version of the app."
"I love the app, used it for years, and it's served me real well as a DJ/Artist promoting his work. But what is this strange glitch when I play my 2-3+ hour long mixes where I can't skip ahead nor backwards with my tracks? It's not all of them, just a few of them, but it's real annoying. When I got to pause the mix and play it again, it keeps doing the same thing, I can't see the progress bar, and it just shows 0:00 while the mix is still playing!! Please help. Please fix this."
"Soundcloud has a variety of songs to pick from, not limited by radio music, video game music, or even music at all since there are also podcasts available. It's incredibly easy to navigate and not only that, easy to start producing on! I don't want to make music so I don't personally benefit from it, but it doesn't cost a dime to start producing on Soundcloud and I think that's great. I love that you can listen to your music or podcasts with your screen off, or while in a different tab."
"When I'm either bored, or drawing in my sketchbook, I would like to listen to some music to help me be inspired and I usually listen to stuff on YouTube so this app does the trick when it comes to that. You can also save the songs that you're really love to hear often if the Wifi gets tooked away. It will automatically save it to the next time you want to hear it. It works really well and nice. LOVE THIS APP!!!!"
"This? Amazing. I love this app to deeeeath. They do the opposite of what every other music app is doing and let you play music however you want, on single loop, loop the playlist, or play in order (at the time of writing this, anyway. never change, SC). UI is nice and simple too, highly recommend."
"Way better than any other music app! I love how you can listen to almost anything and the ads are almost non-existent!! The only thing i dont like about this app is how when you go into your playlist you have to scroll ALL the way down which takes a few seconds. i wish it would be reversed and the songs you just added would be at the top. Other than that, id say its the best app for music ever!! ❤️❤️"
"I love the app a lot. I get to chose the songs I want to listen to and unlimited skips. I don't mind the ads, b it they are a bit repetitive. One thing I think would help improve this app is to have a widget for it. Most music apps do and that's the only problem I have with this. It's not worth getting rid of though. This is an excellent app that I recommend to anyone who likes to listen to.specific songs at specific times"
"Good selection of music, good sound quality. I've had premium for over two years now and I absolutely recommend it. Definitely worth the money for anyone that likes to listen to music. I have a playlist called ""My Music"" that I save everything to and then I have other playlists based on mood, artist, etc. Easy to use and good app design. You can select certain songs, start a playlist from a certain spot, or just shuffle depending on what you feel like. There are both big and small artists."
"I love the app so much. Its useful, its easy to use, and there are so many great songs on there its insane. I like how I can listen to great songs while I work, or play on my phone. I rate this app 10/10. There can be an issue with in-game songs mixed with the song you're listening to, but its easy to fix. Just go to your settings in-game and turn off the backround music. ( just wanted to clerify that because I know I had issues with that at first ). Despite that, this app is great and I reccomend it to anyone who likes to listen to music while working or playing on your devices."
"This app is very great, I use it every single day and personally I don't know what I would do without it. It's very easy to use and there's all sorts of music to he found kn the platform. I do just have one issue, if you could just make an adjustment to your ad system that would be great. For the past 2 months I've been getting constant ads about a smart bed that I never showed interest in, turning on ad personalization didn't help either. Please at some point fix it so ads are more of value!"
"I love using Soundcloud. Although it uses the most battery power of any app on my phone, it has great features. Unlike Spotify or Google Play, you can listen to individual songs or playlists without spending money on a special plan. You need to spend money on a plan to download music, but the app doesn't use too much data anyways. Being a person who posts their own music on Soundcloud, I love being able to get feedback here. I get notifications of followers, people liking my tracks, and more. ✌"
"I really like the app and it's been great, but lately I've been experiencing issues with the repeat function. If I'm just trying to repeat ONE song it works fine, but any time I try to repeat a PLAYLIST it stops working. It'll play the playlist once and then just stop the music. I've been waiting to see if newer updates fix it, but they haven't, so I just wanted to bring attention to it. But I totally love the app and my experience with it thus far. Except the repeat thing, lol."
"I've been using SoundCloud of a couple years and have never had an issue with it. There was an issue that I had a few years where the website had this feature, but the app didn't. Not too long afterwards, the app updated including that feature. Updates are a good plus. Functionality wise, it's straightforward. You open the app and can get straight into listening to music. I've never really had an issue with ads and they appear few and far between songs. Great app, would highly recommend."
"I love this for music; it has a ton of songs. I have one problem: I have the app on my phone and iPad, and I'm signed in on the same account, but it doesn't sync my likes. I have tried refreshing it and restarting it, and also restarting my entire device. Otherwise, it is fantastic and much better than Spotify, Pandora, or Amazon Music."
"This is a great music app alternative with less restrictions. Works great with google voice search for requesting songs while driving. Also, some of the songs are remixed which can be very cool. Continues to play with screen off. Huge selection of music! Viewing ads gives you 30 mins of commercial free listening. Sound quality is excellent. I would definitely recommend it."
"I really liked it. It is like a free Spotify. You can hear all the songs existed, with no ad. High quality songs, and visible to see the tone of voice of the singer (little bars) while watching. You can hear the songs while it is not on the app screen, or if the screen is off. I love it. The one thing that could get better is if you could download the songs. I use it everyday."
"Wonderful. Use it daily. Found many great artists. Very easy to discover new things through the ""similar to things you have liked "" feature. Lets you turn your screen off...very low power usage because of that. I love the app...lets you browse without disturbing song playing. Everything works well...I am TRYING to think of a complaint...and all I come up with is that it can't mix drinks or cook dinner, but if you have that covered it WILL help you soundtrack your life. Listen well."
"Great platform, interface easy navigation, Sounds great. Good selection of music. And the app looks brand to me, which is good, it's sleek, fits your brand, and you're a good competitor. Wait... I'm done! Can you learn piano with this app? Well, I am almost positive you can learn piano? Nice question, too! But, SoundCloud, great little app."
"The biggest reason why you would install SoundCloud over Spotify or any other app for music listening: The free version of the app is the best of any. You're not forced to shuffle all the songs you add, you can search and find most songs. I've had the app on my phone for 4, almost 5 years now. I've never purchased the paid version of the app and I still love it. Only downsides are not all songs are free to listen to, that issue only happens like 2% of the time, and ads play some what often."
"Sound cloud is probably the best app (for music) i have seen out there. It was recommended to me by my friend and i LOVE it. If you are just looking at the reviews and happen to see mine, it is great if you dont mind 10-35 second adds. It also has unlimited skips (forward and backward) no matter what. As long as you are on wifi and you want something easy, convenient, and no problems then download this app because it does deserve a high rating(4 1/2-5 stars for me!)"
I love SoundCloud. It doesn't have too many original versions of songs. I subscribed for offline downloading and no ads and its been great. Worked out really well! I've been subscribed for over 5 years but I don't know whats happened lately. It randomly stops playing music. Its only on SoundCloud since all the other music players I have don't have that issue. If its not fixed/addressed in the next update I'm gonna switch to Spotify. Please fix this...
"I have been using SoundCloud for over four years now, and have favored it over any other platform as long as I've had it. It can be tedious to find an obscure song with the search tool, but apart from that, the app is very easy to navigate. Unless you don't mind paying for GO+, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who listens to a lot of popular music (though this doesn't affect me.) There are a few bugs, but nothing to deduct stars over. Overall, best music streaming platform out there, 5/5."
"Overall a very good music streaming platform. You can find songs of all kinds. The only issue for me right now, is that after the latest update, Soundcloud will crash if I exit the app while music is playing. The only thing that seems to prevent the app from crashing is listening to at least 30 seconds of a song while on soundcloud. It also tells me that the app crashes when I'm using it when it hasn't crashed. Besides those problems, everything is fine."
"Can't believe I just found out about this app (March 2022)!! I've been using YouTube for music & there's so many downfalls to that - specifically the music stops whenever you reply to messages or anything else. I had heard about SoundCloud before, but was under the impression it was for music artists to share their music. I was oblivious, for its real usage. I love this app! I've already started paying for a subscription, which is definitely worth it not having to see all those ads!"
SoundCloud is an all around great app. Sometimes the ads seem like a bit much and if the ad is a video it will pause if the device is turned off. That's something I'd like to see changed. A feature I'd like to see added is a not interested option for songs. In SoundCloud Weekly there are songs I am either not interested in or are always there or don't enjoy. A not interested selection could stop songs people don't want to hear from appearing. Any form of feedback would be nice to hear.
"Man. Okay, so I've done monthly SoundCloud for $9.99 for about 3 years and I really love it. It's sort of chaotic, which is why it's great. if you look up a song, you may not find the song you're looking for, but you'll find 45 remixes of it and 12 covers of it. I've found so much great music accidentally of SoundCloud because there seems to be no rules until a song gets too big and it randomly disappears, which can be disappointing."
Honesty if your looking for a free music app to listen to anywhere without having to pay. This app is for you. As long as you dont mind the ads between songs once in a while. Don't buy the premium version unless you want to listen to certain songs or stop ads. I have never had a problem with this app. Its perfect for me.
"For all those music lovers out there. SoundCloud is a top choice to make. It offers many cool things for musicians and artist. To navigate the app is simple. The amount of music that is on SoundCloud can't be beat. I never had a problem with SoundCloud. I have had it since it came out. They offer musicians accounts that might cost you but it's affordable for most. I love SoundCloud. Create a playlist, like or dislike tracks. Leave positive comments please"
I use the site to reclaim old recordings that I haven't heard in a long time. I lost my entire audio library in a fire of sorts. So I'm going at it one song at a time. I have a couple of large playlists which tends to crash the mobile app sometimes. Otherwise all OK. I just wish there was a mobile app that would let me edit and mix like the old days.
"I like this app. But it have some issues. First and one of the biggest is that if you listening too much of one genre of music, for example if you just starting using the app, it's almost impossible to get new music with other genre. Also it pervent ability to find new genres that you may like. The second issue is when you're listening music and skip one or pause it when you're connected to bluetooth headphones, the music stops and headphones reconecting. I doesn't have that issue in other apps."
"I love using soundcloud. My only wish, is they would make it where when someone calls and the call ends the music can automatically play without me having to go back into the app to continue listening to my playlist. It's super annoying especially when your driving or in the shower. Update It automatically plays!!!!!!!!!😁😁"
"This app is great! There are some glitches here and there, but they aren't too bad. I also like that they put ads in, because I can listen to my songs and they get their money. The one thing, is that the amount of tines they put the same ad on, is ridiculous. And I dislike the fact that you have to pat for better quailty, no ads, and songs that came from the singers themselves is pretty annoying. Otherwise the app is highly recommened, works just fine."
"love this app! it's so good for all of my music needs. the ads are very minimal and i appreciate that since i don't have time to be listening to an ad. everything is very easy to find, but i do have troubles shuffling my playlist sometimes. i would also like to be able to change my profile rather than having to log in on my computer to change it. i recently had an iphone and i was able to change my profile. soundcloud has never really given me problems, and it's the app i use for my music."
"So far everything is great, I could put them all in a playlist and the music just keeps playing. No interruptions, no ads, nothing 10/10. And when the songs in my playlist are finished the app suggests songs and plays it, this app Is wonderful.im shocked I didn't download it before. If you're contemplating ab downloading it, just do it! You won't regret it."
"There is not too many companies I can truely stand by with confidence that are in the best interest of the artist or listener but SoundCloud is definitely one of them. Highly recommend as an artist, definitely go PRo version, totally worth it and gladly support any app/company with my $ that is on the side of the artist 100% of the way. I've used other apps, they don't compare at all. I absolutely love the user friendly, clean click interface. Especially when driving, smooth listening. <3"
"Excellent! This app was my replacement for Spotify. I recently started working, about a month ago, and this gave me something to call my own to spend my money on. Where YT Music is 14.99 a month, this is only 10. And Spotify is 14 a month, yet in my opinion this has a more user friendly interface and is very responsive. My only complaint would be the Xbox app, it is quite glitchy and randomly closes if you pause it. But, I mainly use it on my phone, so that doesn't affect me to much."
it's been the best sound music app that I've ever downloaded and all of the years that a smart device has been developed and soundCloud has been alive. actually I think it was born before I started using it however it's been the best app it has the best options for different types of music and you can see your friends on there and what they like and their playlist.
"This is quite possibly the best designed music app I have ever used. It is so clean and well designed. It operates perfectly without crashing. The UI is tastefully layed out and frankly, beautiful. The cover art scrolls by as you listen to a song. It integrates really well with Android UI and notifications, lock screen, etc. And that's before we even speak of how awesome the SoundCloud community is and how amazing this service is as a discovery tool. Crisp, clean, a masterclass in UX design."
"I use this app AND Spotify. They both have music that the other does not. Spotify strongsuit includes more mainstream music, and SoundCloud captures more indi musicians. If your looking for new good songs, you'll find some on both apps, just keep in mind they have different cultures and SoundCloud is more experimental. (DEVELOPERS PLEASE READ) there is a little bug where if you scroll a song to the beginning to replay it, it'll continue to play where it was for a few seconds. Please fix"
"Amazing, I've had it for a few months and love it, it's a little confusing to get started on, but after that it's nice and smooth from then. I have needed a app to display my piano because I love sharing it, and sound cloud is a good way to do it. And you can listen to others music, follow people, comment, heart, it's amazing 11/10 experience %100 would recommend!!"
"My go to music app. love, love, love this simple to use app. No need to drain battery or data to keep music playing because the app has to be open. I still have the ability to follow friends or even new people who have similar tastes in music, + like tracks or repost them into playlists. browse new music and add to what ur listening to, repost, like, or share any track. Only real downfall for me is that the free version some times won't have the original song (mainly remixed version)"
"Responsive app with great UI design. Definitely the ""frontier"" of music artists as there are so many undiscovered artists that can be followed here and this is the only place to find their music. Really cool. Love the in-song comment feature, which in addition to the private messaging feature (which right now is desktop only), and the follow feature, make it more social than any music streaming app out there."
"My overall experience with this app is pretty great. the graphic designers did a great job at making a beautiful, cool and easy to use platform. It's easy to share my tunes to any social media platform with all my friends/ fan. lol. And for that I'm really grateful. Soundcloud is amazing for well established artists with a prolific fan base, someone just starting out or anyone inbetween. I can honestly say I love it! One minor complaint, cant figure out how to edit or delete tracks. Please help!"
"Soundcloud is perfect, an app that contains nearly the entire music library and complete choice of any song you want all for the price of a few ads. Also the ability to make any song you want. I really enjoy this app for the variety of music pretty much any song you want at any time (as long as you save it to your playlist) also with the added benfit of high quality tracks. If you want good music get this app."
"Probably one of the best music streaming apps out there, and it's free. And allows you to play music out of the app, on infinite loop. Which is good so I can practice songs and learn songs I love. One thing that could improve is maybe the reordering of playlists. The user should be able to do that when they open the playlist. Same with the like list. But other than that, everything is very good! I would totally recommend this to anyone who is looking for a music streaming app."
"I've been using soundcloud since 2015 and I can safely say that it is the best music streaming service. Most songs can be found in their official mp3, which a lot of people complain about not being true for all songs. There is a more recent problem although. If you unlike a song and then like it again to put it on the top of your likes list, it will always revert back to it's original place after refreshing the likes list page. this is only recent, as I used to do this a lot. Overall, its amazin"
"Great app, great music. An interesting and oddly useful variety in music that ranges between normal to ""why is this even on SoundCloud?"" Offline listening is free- IF you listen to the same group of songs often enough, so that's awesome. My only complaint is that the 'SoundCloud Weekly' playlist of recommended songs often repeats songs I've already heard or already liked. For 3 weeks I had the same songs over and over again, but that issue seems to have mostly fixed itself. Overall great. ✨"
"I've had a soundcloud account for over 8 years and I loved it when i first got the app and i still love it now. This is one of my go to apps to listen to music. And not only can you make your own playlist and add music/songs you listen to on the app. But you can also make your very own page if you happen to be a singer/artist, this is a perfect app to start off and promoting/sharing your music."
"A must have for music selection. It gathers your mainstream plus the underground artists that haven't chosen YouTube as their platform. The two apps alongside each other, I would say, has the best probability of any two apps of having the highest percentage of musical artists on the planet. Keep in mind that I come to that conclusion without doing any research. A simple Google search may show otherwise, but I rate and comment on this app with my personal opinion."
"Better than Pandora and Spotify with free unlimited skips and the ability to replay as much as you want, choose what songs to listen to, and even have separate playlists. All it needs is to do the up next to stay instead of going back to normal. Also just could use more songs. Amazing platform for people to post music as well."
"The only music app I've ever used. I like the art sidescrolling on tracks. Best part about SoundCloud is discovering new tracks, I take a song I love and make a single track playlist, after that song is over it loads I guess a random song based on the previous song, and that's how I discover new 💎's. Sometimes that song could be 7 years old and I'm just amazed. Old or new its a one of a kind experience! Thank you for all the memories ❤️"
"SoundCloud may not be as relevant as it once was, but it's still the GOAT streaming service for me, personally. It gave a platform to countless amazing artists I would have otherwise never found and changed the game in the industry, allowing artists to blow up without needing labels and signing away the rights to their music. I still discover incredible tunes all the time here. I can't recommend it enough to those looking to explore experimental genres and sounds like no other platform offers."
"I have personal preferences for the UI (it is smooth, some of the places that I go to often though can get confusing. perhaps it is me and my muscle memory getting confused, or I could be just momentarily not present). Regardless of my personal preferences, SoundCloud goes above and beyond for providing music from artists who are still up and coming (the gems yet to hitthe snowball/tipping point), as well as already established and main stream full blown made it. the spectrum. thank you SC!"
"Love the app! I have been using this app for like 4 years and I could never switch to another music streaming app. I've literally found my favorite underground and original songs that you could probably never find on apps the promote big creators more than smaller ones. I have no complaints thus far except for the amount of adds, but that's part for the course for a free service. I would definitely pay for SoundCloud Go if I had the funds."
"Great app love it, it's been around for a minute. Great streaming platform and useful for uploads. Thanks soundcloud, just have 1 minor inconvenience. When I'm already listening to music, then go to open the app again it goes to an advertisement. This occurs halfway through my song and it's frustrating. Love to see this fixed thanks. -kennysmokes"
"love the app, only thing I ask is the ability to block certain content, or an option to at least block the the covers on the songs, example there was a post of a naked lady on a t rex, I would like the option to just be able only to see the title of the song and the person who produced, have no interest in seeing picture that are inappropriate for me at least, great app wouldn't turn to any other, but please add that option to this I would be really grateful thanks 😊"
"i love SoundCloud! it's the only music platform I really like. I find such amazing new music, like a couple years before it hits the radio. and I like that I can share stuff I find to friends and it's playable right there in their messages on the SoundCloud player. it works with every phone I've had, high end to low end and there's not a butt load of ads. the ones that happen (to pay for all the cool free stuff) aren't that long or to often. everyone should check this out, fo sho!"
"good stuff. got turned on to it by a friend, and I thought it was for hacks in basements with digital mixers and keyboards... and it is! but some of these artists are freaking phenomenal, and surprised the hell out of me. I have my Spotify for my ""normal"" music. but when I want or need something special, I come to SoundCloud and if never fails to deliver. good stuff.."
"its like spotify but you can pick specific songs without paying 10 bucks. it doesnt have every song that spotify does, and especially lacks older music, but its library is expansive and largely high-quality. plus they pay smaller artists a higher rate per stream, which alone would make me choose soundcloud over the competition. its a great app that ive never had any problems with."
"High quality, well made app. Very popular so alot of good music is here. Also not overbearing on ads anymore like it used to be. Young producers starting out on their phones like me are a bit screwed cause of an issue with the verification email not being sent and there being no option to resend it but on PC this is a very producer friendly platform. Even FL studio(PC) has a function to automatically post your songs here when you export them."
"I love this so much. I can add the music from my computer to my smartphone wireless. I will need to search on Youtube for the types of House Music I like hearing. And add it to my playlist, I enjoy hearing certain DJ'S that are from around the world all on this site. First signup and get an account it's free. I have had mine since 2013. Slowly adding music to my playlist. Now I can hear it as I walk through Chicago streets. Yes, they have Ads breaks, but I enjoy the music after the Ads."
"Honestly, it's better than other big music apps like spotify and pandora, and I'm glad I'm finally able to find a music app that works at my school because they never seem to be connected. I also love that we can skip songs without being so limited and listen to the songs I choose. I highly would recommend to anyone looking for a good music app"
"This app is awesome I rate this a five star. But there's only one problem: the ads. There's so many of them even when I swipe to right, it looks like there's no ad right? I leave it alone. But when the song's over, there it is. Also, I swipe to the right again, it says 'Advertisement' up top. So I'm like 'Oh, there's only one? Not that big of a deal.' But then when THAT is over, there turns out to be two adds. This really annoys me, please fix this! Thanks!"
"Pretty good, nice high quality sound! I've been using it a whole lot since october; it's very nice to be listening to music while I work. I would ask for a option to select multiple songs that I've liked and yo put them in playlists since its tedious to go one by one through each one trying to make a playlist."
"A lovely app that I have very few problems with. Definitely something to get if you don't like Spotify's MANY glitches and bad choices. The only problem I have is that as far as I can tell reporting is near impossible. Whenever you do try to report something it takes you to a help website instead of a menu or something where you can y'know, report stuff."
"Edit: Not sure on whose side it got fixed but it is indeed fixed. Having a great time as usual listening to my underground artists. Original: Still getting audio static/clicking noise after android system update in this app. Love my choices of music, but if I'm not listening to it over my speakers, the clicking is unbearable. You guys fixed it last update, you can do it again. Good app otherwise."
"love this app. I don't like premium, but it's perfect. even though some songs need premium, people repost them with a slight change, so it's amazing either way. BARELY any adds. I post my own songs on here! it's amazing! love using this app. so perfect. would recommend to people who want to either listen to music, or even make music! if you just want to listen, create your own playlist and everything! want to post songs? THAT WORKS TOO! love the app!!!!!!!!!!!! so good!!!!! best thing ever!!!!!"
"The free payment plan is much better than on Spotify. The app works flawlessly with my device, I've had no issues whatsoever. I definitely recommend this over Spotify. Spotify is shoving payment plans down your throat, to enjoy Spotify you pretty much need to pay. On soundcloud, I get all my needs for free, and I never felt like they tried to constantly get me to pay."
"I love SoundCloud. Just one thing:: plz bring back the ability to view the cover art for a song in bigger form after clicking on ""Behind This Track"". After the update it only shows a mini-pic version. I like and admire the ability to screenshot the cover art. Thank you! Post-Update:: I think it has kinda been fixed now. Sweet."
"I've been using this app for music for over 7 - 8 years in many devices and many different accounts as well, and I've never regretted choosing SoundCloud. I love the interface and the collection of music. This app has so many advantages providing me all the features to satisfy all my needs always and has never failed even a single time over these years. Music has changed my life a lot and i would totally agree that SoundCloud was reason behind it all. Thank you for such an app. Good work."
"The app is really good and very fun so I rate it with a 5 star. But I do have a couple of issues with it, sometimes when I'm playing music it pauses or plays another song, when I pause a music it plays and when try to pause it on my notification bar it doesn't pause nor play. I do hope that you fix this, thanks! (Sorry if my grammar is bad.)"
"I just got it for around the fifth time or so, the first time i used it, it was for about a month, I found tunes by elvis presley on SoundCloud, that are not on Spotiy, YouTube Music, Apple Music, Deeper Music, 360 Music, and more. And the sound is very good if not great with the Sony 360 Reality Audio Truly Wireless in the ear headphones. Very Good Job. Keep it up. Thank you. Have a nice day."
"I didn't see an issue, I don't know what happened to the other people but it works perfectly for me! It's definitely worth 5 stars!! It has very good music, you can play offline, you make playlists, plus the songs still play when I close my phone so that's good 👍🏽 I can have this for when I'm going to school, simply put on my headphones and go! Worth to say it has a loop button for every song and playlist!!! 🤚🏽🤚🏽"
"SoundCloud is by far the most generous and awesome web site to disappear in and get lost in the world of independent art as well as a few untapped experiments in sound by some already well established bands. Also a great place to gain recognition or much needed attention for whatever project you are currently indulging . It is also, of course, a fair and caring site with a great team of music lovers to support your interest whatever they may be. Fantastic place for fans of electronic music etc.,"
"the app is surprisingly way better then the web client, the only thing I could complain about is the tagging function not being present AT ALL on mobile. if I wanna tag someone else with @.... I have to switch to PC everytime. otherwise SoundCloud is way better then the alternatives, coming from an 8year long Spotify premium User, I never looked back since switching 1.5years ago :)"
"SoundCloud is my new much-loved music application. It's so very easy to utilize as well as has a fantastic choice of music. I can't think how much songs is readily available for free, and also the registration alternatives are additionally excellent. I absolutely advise SoundCloud to any person looking for a fantastic songs application."
Good app overall just goo many adds like maybe play 2 adds every 10 songs??? Cuz no one wants to go back to back with ads just ruins things so probably should fix the add system and it's not like people actually listen to them we just turn it down till it's over but I'm pretty sure this system would make things better
YOO if you don't have sound cloud first of all you're not on that underground wave and second of all I bet u have Spotify and ur weird for that. I LOVE YOU SOUNDCLOUD!!! NO OTHER APP will pick the BEST SONGS and be THE MOST SUPER CONVENIENT USER FRIENDLY music streaming platform I've ever had. c'mon just download it and trust me give it the five stars when u know I'm right:)
Hey SoundCloud. I've enjoyed your app since I was 14 an now I'm 23years old. I've only used the account email I'm on for about almost twoyo.I seem to have a problem. I'm very very suspicious of it. (HERE IT GOES) [I one day got kicked out the App SoundCloud while I was using it via music and it's been over two months now. Now that I haven't been able to sign in. It says can't find email this an that. I even tried creating an account then it says I can't use it because it's already used.plz help
"Easily my most used platform. I have a lot more control of what I listen to than Spotify or pandora yet still gives me the opportunity to explore new music. Adds are fairly reasonable, and very rarely do I have problems with it."
"This app is really just that unique that I decided to 5 star it. This music app gets a lot of stuff right even more than any mainstream music site Especially the community generated content which has a very large space for creativity and you can even find very niche but hidden gem artists , also it's free , doesn't have ads and it doesn't force it's subscription upon you. I really didn't expect to find a music app that is not trash."
"Easy to use, not to many ads‼️‼️ It's open to anyone and shows with the ability that anyone can post music of any kind (even their own). Playlist is easy to manage🗣️ ‼️‼️ Profile is very simple to modify when you feeling different, and allows you to ""express yourself"" how you desire. The song that you would be currently playing has a non-stop continuation even outside the app🗣️‼️‼️ (unlike other music apps.. (""YouTube Music""💀🥱) Overall W app My favorite music app 🤷🏾‍ Ight, gang 🗣️‼️"
i love the app. Easy to flow with and the best world of music where u get to share u own thoughts for music. if I'm gonna rate in percentage I'll still rate 100%. But even still perfection still has a way to to become imperfect when it comes to other people's opinions. So my suggestion is create a room for downloads please
I've been using this app for many years. I'd say about 6. (Since 2017) and I can't even begin to tell you how amazing it is. It has a great catalog (not just music either) and it's extremely good for creators trying to make a name for themselves (myself) Even without a membership there aren't many ads and your not missing out on anything majorly exclusive (other than offline listening) To me this app is amazing. I would go longer but there is a limit to these reviews. Thank you Soundcloud. 🧡
Awesome app. Been using it since my friend came back from visiting Ukraine about 8 years ago. He told me about it after someone back home showed this awesome app to him. It's been my music app since that day. Thanks to everyone involved with creating the awesome Soundcloud. Keep up the good work.
I love this app I can choose what songs I wanna listen to and the quality of the sound is top notch. It has all the songs Spotify would have which is sum that I like but I would recommend this to people who don't like other music platforms
I'm really amazed with SoundCloud: Play Songs & Songs! This application is very easy to use and also has a terrific selection of songs. I like that I can listen to music offline which the app keeps track of my paying attention background. I would certainly advise this app to any person trying to find a terrific choice of songs to pay attention to!
"I just subscribed and the sound quality, selection, easy to use features, and no glitches thus far! If this is indicative of how this app always performs...It's a keeper! Developers...how do I keep it from CONSTANTLY Being on? My battery needs all the help it can get."
"If you're looking for a way to listen to music on your phone without having to fork over a ton of cash, SoundCloud is a great option. You can listen to music from virtually any source, and it's free to use. The app is easy to use, and the interface is colorful and stylish. You can also share music with friends easily, or listen to music while you work. Overall,SoundCloud is a great app for listening to your favorite tunes."
"I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH,I used to use Spotify and it's so bad after the update u can't even turn off shuffle and you can only skip the song for only 6 times per hour like that's insane, I've found this app and it's literally the best it's so good, you can do everything without upgrading it, thank you so much sound cloud this is the best experience ever"
"I don't usually write reviews without being asked, but today, I am. SoundCloud works better than any other music app for me. Some songs need SoundCloud go where you could listen elsewhere for free, but still, SoundCloud has the biggest music variety and there are limited ads. To the creators of SoundCloud, thank you. This is 20/10 app."
"Love this app for finding new music and musicians. I like how easy it is to find music within similar genres, and another huge plus: SoundCloud allows music to play in the background. This feature alone makes me reach for it more than YT for listening to music."
"Great music apps with a great library of independent musicians. The app stays on when you play music & put your phone on rest mode to save on battery power! I connect my phone in my vehicle & the sound is outstanding, no static or distortion. A great app!!!"
"I love it you don't have to pay to listen but you do have to pay of you want no ads. But it doesn't give ads in middle of songs. Even when you close the app it still plays. You don't have to have internet, so you can listen any where, anytime. Overall best music app of all time :)"
The perfect music streaming app for me ✨ I've been using SoundCloud for close to 4 years now and I've never for once regretted the day I installed it. The feature I love the most is that I ask Google Assistant to play me any song on SoundCloud and it does just that... Amazing Isn't it? Kudos to the team 🔥❤️
"SoundCloud still has the best music and the app is pretty good. Been using it since 2014, no complaints. I wish I could buy a lifetime membership though.. not interested in subscriptions."
"Android app does a good job of replicating desktop functionality while still taking advantage of the touch screen of the phone/tablet. The one thing I wish it would let me do is lock the phone and have it continue to stream the audio portion while not showing the video. The video is not essential for some streams (chatting, news, etc.), but I have to lay the phone down rather than locking it and putting it in my pocket. Burns the phone battery for no reason."
"I think this app works very good for what it does and I will continue using it. But I do recommend more user compatibility with Google browser & Google accounts and other technology, like a computer because when I hit the space bar to pause the video it does not pause it so I have to grab my mouse and click on it but wen I get back it works just fine and it pauses & unpauses like normal, Just stuff like that!?."
"Very organized occasionally has minor crashes not only for me but usualy within 5 to 10 minutes or even less sometimes it's back up and good to go. The only other comment I have about this app is how annoying it is to verify that your email is the correct email. But the fact that at any time on a stream I can pause, mute, create funny clips of a favorite stream, go theater or fullscreen mode or have even a mod view and change graphics in the settings is wonderful with just a click of a mouse.!!!"
"One of my favorite apps ever. So much fun, so many people I've really connected with and even fallen in love with because of this. Something for everyone, great at mixing people, places, cultures in exciting, fun, innovative ways. Can be improved of course but a good foundation and infrastructure for potentially a lot more. Twitch will probably survive and thrive into the holographic media revolution. Cheers."
"The app is good. I'm used to using the browser version at home, but the app works great. Video is smooth and chat seems to post with little to no delays. I have noticed that every once and a while the subscription bar will pop up as I'm watching a stream, but I'm not sure if that's an issue with my phone or the app. Overall, a good experience that doesn't take away from streams."
Love this app but one major suggestion: I adore this app and for the most part it functions fine but I have one but suggestion. Can Twitch please program the ability to pause videos if you hit the pause button on your headphones. Most video apps allow this but twitch doesn't for some reason. It would be really handy to have as sometimes I pause to talk to someone but then I forget twitch doesn't have the pause headphone button function. Not a requirement but just throwing that out there.
"Definitely love this! Great alternative to the desktop/web browser version. Helps me be able to help my brother tweak things on his stream (from a viewers standpoint) in a minutes notice cuz all i gotta do is flip out my phone. Chatting is fluid, and doesnt do that weird thing most browser-app conversions do where the keyboard closes randomly when typing. Seems to have supported mobile emojis as well as integrated ones. Video latancy is the same as on PC and almost seems faster at times."
"Twitch is such an awesome platform, I love the app and the concept. The only problem I've ever had, and a problem i have had this problem more than once, is logging into the application for the first time after installing and it coming up with an error when logging in and then not being able to login for a while after getting the error. It eventually always allows me to login eventually after trying logging in again after a day or so."
"Absolutely Amazing! Twitch changed my life. The streaming prossess is not difficult, and watching a stream is clear as the sun is on a nice day. When you get into a stream, the first 20 second adds are just 20 seconds, while other apps will have adds that could be minutes! Twitch easily saves a past stream you were watching, so you can easily go to it and watch it again. Highly recommend twitch to anybody looking for a livestreaming platform."
"Twitch is a hardly used application, but always there to pick up the slack, and provide enough of a stable build to keep the operating system stable. Also this application may be a little less annoying than people think to maintain."
I love this app. Use it as an alternative to youtube when there is nothing interesting to watch. But please improve your privacy and trackers. It's making me a little concerned how much data the company needs from all devices & only drives me more to use the webside side of the client instead of the app client. Please take out these trackers so I may continue using this app in ease while also staying protected online. Thank you.
"Solid exp. Wish it was easier to figure out how to stop giving them money. But all around good content, awesome creators, and relatively east to use interface. Even the smaller streamers are.good people and fun to hang out with."
"This app is super good and whether you want to stream on mobile or watch streams, thus is the right choice. It's also easy if like me you stream on xbox and you need to respond to your chat and even to set it up in the first place. Because turning on my PC to check the chat is inconvenient since my desktop is in another room."
"Ever since the recent update I haven't been receiving alerts about when people I'm following go live. I don't know what's going on but this has never happened before. And when streamers do predictions, I have to close out of the stream and re-enter, which is annoying. Twitch has not been a problem for me using but of late this is ridiculous. This needs fixed"
"Perfect everything, you can find what you want, you can see when your favourite channel is streaming and you can interact with your channel (when they're streaming) easily. It's free too, and doesn't bombard you with ""buy now for yada yada"" garbage, just watch and enjoy. Seamless app experience, with pop out viewing so you can watch while you do other things. Perfect for relaxing with so many different genres of streams. I love twitch."
I love it. It's a good streaming platform for beginners and also gives tips and tricks to be successful. But you might wanna look at other people's opinions too because some people might give the pros and cons of twitch.
This app is so worth it I am totally going to keep on using it and I'm not going to trade it for anything so I suggest you to download it it has pretty long ads but still it's amazing. And one of my favorite bands is about to do something on there and oh my God I can't stop!!! And I know if anyone gets it you better treat it right cuz it's awesome!!!
"Great app, great option for streaming and watching those things you love, excellent service and support, easy to use and only takes a short time to get used to. 5 stars"
"The highlight of my at least 3-4 times a week is to watch Professional Casual Network play some of my favorite games. Tim is an awesome gamer, and Taylor is great at paints. And the rest of them except the dumpling killer are awesome. 😎"
very great streaming platform. i find it very fun to be apart of a video while it's in the making and this is the perfect app for just that. it's very unique in the ways it shows off streams you might like and categories of streams you might also like. i use this app a lot to watch the streamers i love.
"Great interactive fun. It is good for finding live channels for all kinds of topics, including music and game related content. It works great."
"most people have bad opinions of twitch but me as a girl I personally I love playing a bunch of difficult games that I find difficult to find videos on or people playing them, twitch lets me choose the game I want to see people play and I gain experience from it, I don't understand why people don't like it anymore when for me it's been really nice, we all have different experiences tho! ^^"
"Ads are super loud compared to the channels I am watching which break your eardrums. Edit: they seem to have listened to feedback and have adjusted the volume so I am happy to give it 5 stars, great platform to watch your fav streamers, especially in popout mode."
"Tbh It's a really good app if you just wanna watch the LIVE experience of your fav streamer / YouTuber, Personally It a good thing and ppl who say it's bad ? Man , I could never say that , tbh. I don't mind the ads to much. And the fact you can rewatch any video at anytime [ if you have sub ] it's pretty good 10/10 exp"
"Honestly didn't know how I felt about streaming for a while, but I found it to be a thing I actually like doing. My streams may not be very active, but within the short amount of time I have been I've gain a decent little follow base. I'm always down for a follow for follow yungm1k3 on twitch!"
"Switching to another platform. Account was deleted for no reason, and there is no way to contact Twitch support and get help. Infuriating. Deleting my 2 accounts. Everyone posts their content on YouTube anyway. Finally fully making the switch. EXTREMELY disappointing."
"Ngl I use this app so much for my favorite underrated streamers (suck as DreamerSeeker) and its honestly amazing. One thing I'd change, though, is how often past streams disappear. Unable to be viewed. Overall, other than that, it's great!"
Works great. Can play outside of the app while you do other stuff (which is something YouTube makes you pay for). Unskippable ads but MUCH less than YouTube. A great app if you like watching creator content as much as I do. Wish I'd found it sooner.
"I have been using twitch for a long time and there is some things that need fixing sure but we all know that and they should know that as well. I believe you should also fix your mobile streaming as well because it only gets you a small part of it after your done plus it sometimes kicks you out of your stream when you do stream on mobile.I would reccomend this app to friends and family if they want to see me stream or watch general entertainment of their favorite games.But, could you fix them?😊"
Love this App. It's one of my most used for watching and streaming. I just wish I could do more stuff on it that is PC only. But I do love that I can stream without a PC. Long Live twitch! 🐾
Have had my issues with this app but lately it performs well and the update to put ads on the side and not discontinue the stream playing is the best thing they could have done
"Works well enough when I wanna farm drops at least. Not really big on the whole streaming thing, but the app does what I need."
This is an awesome streaming app that allows you to watch people play tons of games or do things in real life and communicate with them if they are live. 📹🎮🕹️ You can watch movies and TV shows that are available as well. 🎥🎬🎞️🎟️🍿
Really nice substitute for YouTube if you like way longer videos and wanna actually chat with your favorite YouTuber/twitch streamer. I'm still getting usted to it but I haven't seen any problems so that's thumbs up from me.
"Would be better if I could turn the volume down on just this app, because I use it to watch streams, but will also do other stuff while watching said streams. Edit: they now have that feature in the settings. Thank you very much, devs!"
"Great app to use, UI is very clean and overall simple app. plus its super easy to start streaming"
Very good and useful to watch on. It doesn't give as much ads as YouTube and it's better to watch a live stream on twitch than YouTube
I really loved this app because you can watch your favorite streamers in a real HD quality and also you can do other apps while watching here on Twitch! It will minimize into a smaller but visible view and manage to do other stuffs in your phone. Also the people here in Twitch community are all genuine! That's what I love about this app!
"Love it, I stream, don't get viewers but gives me something to do and I like watching my freinds, bots are a wee problem but doesn't bother me, it's just something fun for me and my freinds to do, it's a good way to build a community and possibly make money doing so Ps. Better than YouTube"
App i love because its got some awesome communities developing in it and the Mechanics of the stream are very amazing. I have a better understanding of how to use it now!
I like this app a lot I can watch videos live stream for how ever long ad I want and I can watch others I can get to tLk to people I'm just the right age so it all works out.
Twitch is my favorite place to watch all different kinds of live streams. This app is one of my most used apps on all of my devices. I really enjoy watching all kinds of live streams and my favorite streamers! 🤍
"Not just for watching gamer's streams! I use it to watch the streams of DJs, artists, and crafts people too. There's a lot of worthwhile content to be seen here."
It's so easy to communicate to the streamer and the streamer can communicate to us . This is like discord but a bit better. 5 stars to twitch. :)(:
"Thanks for making the switch from normal mode into background playback on Android super smooth. In the past the audio was gone for a few s when switched into background mode. That is now fixed, soo much better. Thanks to the devs making the happen"
"Only bad thing is the highly obtrusive ads, ads would be fine if they didn't take the viewer out of the livestream. Sometimes I get a small pop up to the left hand side but generally ads completely overtake the app. other than that it is hours of free content"
"Love this app, has great streamers on the platform and I love the ability to win free in game items from the free drops from only watching the streams for a few hours which I do anyway. The app has little to no lag/bugs (could depend on your device) and has the ability to start your own streams to try grow. Overall great app"
"Good app I can watch my favorite streamers for free, but have the option to donate or subscribe. I do need a phone number to comment though, which sucks."
"To be honest in my opinion this is an awesome streaming platform, Of course there are some fakes but to be honest this is a good streaming platform and I highly recommend this if you want to stream."
"It' realy responsible and it doesn't lag, they have done a good job over the years, best streaming phone app and it's design is up to I think anyones standards."
I stream with twitch all the time and never have had any issues !!..... Although I wish you guys would let you do more things while streaming on console ...like more effects
❤️ from the US Multiple content creators from all around the world playing some of our favorite games . You can follow any of the streams and also get notifications sent directly to your phone tablet etc.
It is one of the best apps to ever screen 1 you can do anything I like to use the other time I'd like to stream my games on it everything
Twitch is my go to for watching gamers stream. I've made some great friends and found some truly amazing gamers. Love the app!
"Twitches a Very Nice App Recommendations, they seem a little too much You check out the person and if you choose to follow you follow them if you choose not to 2 steps Beginning to understand leaving Subs $4.99 I'm not sure how they collect It could be through Google I haven't looked into it Some people drop you because you don't give"
It's a great app with developers of games I love to play. Many live channels to talk and even share ideas with in the chat. It's just fun to hang on as long as a streamer you vibe with is playing your favorite games on any console.
"It's very easy to use, but I wish you could see more of your stream dashboard on it. Besides that, it's great to use for simply watching streams and chatting."
I have developed a lot of parasocial feelings towards these strangers...it hasn't been a problem yet. Twitch doses my seratonin with it's extremely diverse content communities. I literally laugh out loud constantly at some of the reactions to reactions to reactions to reactions. Need more love for speed runners though. There's a huge void in content for females though. Push style and beauty or even shopping categories. You need to capitalize on this NOW. #hireme.
Easy to navigate and find content creators. The interface is definitely better on PC than mobile or console.
This app is a great app to watch your favorite stream in action. The only thing I hate about it its just the adds popping on in a middle of the stream when it get interesting. But I still like the app.
"Interface is seamless although sometimes I have trouble setting up my stream. But all in all, this app is superb! 👏🏼"
"I love twitch, I have had very few problems and enjoy all of the special features and things you can do. The quality is awesome!"
Brilliant platform to watch whatever you want. You can also stream yourself or just watch your favourite streamers. It's definitely one of the best platforms for watching videos on!
"As of today, I haven't had problems in my user experience. Video, audio, and chat rooms work perfect."
This is a overall good websitebit is easy to use. One of the down falls is it does have ads. But overall this is an amazing website
"Its handy to have twitch on my phone so I can keep track of the chat box while I game. I've only recently begun steaming maybe a week ago, Twitch is a good app that gives you a chance to show everyone how good you are at video games or how goofy you can be. This part I just found out actually: Twitch will give you a detailed report on how your stream went and also has a guide to learn something about streaming."
I like twitch because I like to stream on it. I like to talk to chat. I really want to be a famous twitch streamer. I like to have my own creater code and lockor bundle in the itemshop. I want to get 10k followers. I want to be family friendly and other people to be family friendly to other people and not tell personal information or things to strangers.
"Awesome streaming platform that is easy to set up and you can stream any game, And you don't have to stream you can also watch !! Im telling you It's worth getting!"
I use this app. for watching my chat while I stream on twitch. it's been a blessing to be able to see what my viewers say and interact with them without having to pause my stream! I'm hoping the stream gods/goddesses bless me with allowing this to be my full-time job. 🙏❤️
I barelly use it but it's kinda fun actually. Still need to get used to what to do around it and stuff. Been using it more after all the controversy this years games brought to support streamers in general 🤔
"Twitch app really helps me take control of my stream. Helps me change title, use tag, and add description. It is easy to use and is you decide, you can also stream via twitch app."
It's a working progress but it works and support is very helpful. Get on the problems and help fix them ASAP.
"The video to audio isn't in sync. I hear what's happening in real time, then gets to see what's happening"
It is fun and interactive I can watch my favorite streamers and stream myself there are a lot category's to see over all the app is a great way to be social without leaving your bed.
The twitch drops are great on mobile responds great and the drop down menu allows for easy searching without issues
Great! Ideal for getting notifications and a quick heads up on content to view.
"It's always been the go to game streaming app or website. Not sure you want to buy a game? See if it's good first by watching. Bored and enjoy good entertainers? Find a stream that suits your humor, etc. Twitch has never let me down"
I enjoy using twitch and maybe one day I'll get to perhaps stream... The community is great! I would recommend this to friends and family who are into videogames.
"This Place is amazing and I can watch all of my favorite people here, in my opinion Getting Verifyed is easy! So you can Type in the chat! In conclusion I think this place is amazing 👍"
One of my favorite things about twitch is that it will let you know when you're The people that you subscribe to or follow? Are doing a stream and it? Lets you know that which is really like nice and I like. How it does that so thank you twitch. Sorry for the grammar.
Very enjoyable app with awesome and unique posts! I love putting this on in the background while I draw.
Second review Can you fix the clipping on mobile phones. It's always messing up. I go to clip but it won't let me add title or edit the clip to 1 min. First review Love twitch.. love all the streamers on there. If you don't sub you will get a lot of ads but just remember those ads are supporting your favorite streamer
"It is a very nice app, I really like that you can stream and watch different varieties of games from anywhere in yhe world. I really wish that there was like a history tab so that we would'nt have to research for a particular video and we would just continue from where we left off"
"Love joining chats with other like minded people and seeing gamers enjoy games that I relate with. Where I live, not many people enjoy it like I do. This is a whole world for me to get to know lots of people who share my hobbies. 10/5 Stars!"
Easy to use when viewing streamers. I have not personally used the app to stream so I don't know if there's any issue with that.
"Twitch has been amazing and fun. Being a viewer has been absolutely wonderful. Also, I'm a streamer so it's been fun too!"
I love twitch! I would definitely recommend. I love the layout and all of the things that you can do on his lovely app❤
Twitch just expanses to other streamers who might do yt and also use twitch you can follow them and when you do follow them it rewards you 300 points but then if you watch for 5 or 10 minutes you get 10 more points and at time to time if you keep watching it will reward you with 50 points
I enjoy watching Twitch. It is customizable and there is content for just about anybody. It's entertaining.
"After multiple updates, I have to edit the review up to 5 stars because when I'm not home and I want to go live or inform my fans I can open the app and go live from the create section. And it is easy to set up your stream from the mobile app maybe easier than on the PC or console. I use twitch on my phone, PC, and Xbox and it works amazing on all, I do not have a Playstation so I cannot say a thing about it."
Love the features and easy navigation to curate the content you want to watch/follow. 😍
Normally a wonderful experience with nice rich sound. It does freeze occasionally but I know there can be many reasons for that. Keep up the excellent work.
"By far the best streaming app IMO! Whether casual viewing or subscribing to favourite streamers or games the twitch app has it all. In game drops for certain games can be redeemed just for watching and transfer to your PS4/5, Xbox or PC games as long as you've linked profiles. If you like game streaming (as a viewer or creator) download this!"
"Despite the fact that Twitch pays it's creators in peanuts, I do love watching streams while at work. So this app is convenient and helps me get through my night."
What a blast in a glass!!! Mad Luv to my Dear.....Longtime friend....Matt The Bratt!!! So many memories. The only thing I didn't like was when Matt had 2 sign off!! Your still killing it!! The App was so fun.....And you know that's Right!!
It's a great app the only thing is that it shows to much ads but for some ads they play and you can still watch the stream without missing a little thing! Plus this app supports many languages which is the top for me!
"Twitch is a very good game streaming app, I would recommend so I don't really understand why people are saying there are so many problem."
"Easy to use, especially with the mobile creator dashboard for a side piece when streaming. Great for chat, during streams"
"I love Twitch, I have it up every single day. Best live streaming platform in my opinion. Highly Recommend!!!!! Happy Streaming 😊"
"10/10 app for streaming and watching live streams :D, keep up the good work!"
Fix the damn video bug and it'll be nearly perfect. This is a GREAT photo app. My only personal complaint as a photo app is I wish they would include the camera calibration like they have in Lightroom classic. Now on to what's bugging the hell out of me. Bring able to color and trim videos on lightroom mobile is awesome and a part of my social media work flow. But semi recently a bug started every time I attempt to trim a clip. It gives me a error and I lose all editing progress.
"Best editing software in the game, straight up. You can expect nothing but the best from Adobe and all their other products, which by the way you can easily export and save projects within the creative cloud, which makes organizing projects easier and all of your photos across different apps easily accessable. If you're into photography and you're not using Adobe products I don't know what you're doing."
"I have actually been utilizing the Lightroom app for Android for a few weeks currently and I'm definitely caring it! It's extremely effective as well as straightforward, with user friendly sliders as well as picture filters that permit you to promptly and also conveniently edit your images on the go. I'm additionally truly delighting in the transformative presets, as they make it really simple to include special adjustments that really make my pictures attract attention. Extremely recommended!"
"I love using Lightroom mobile and for PC. It is easy to use and has everything you need to edit (lighting, effects, defringing, crop). Although for a month or so now, when deleting photos, the photo won't fully delete. The thumbnail will black out, but when the app is restarted, the photo is still there. The only way to fix it is to close the app and reopen. Also, my cloud storage has slowed significantly and is constantly spinning."
"Honestly, this one of the best photo editing apps I've ever come across. Really taught me a lot on the technical stuff, and although there are some features that are only available via monthly payments (which is only about $5 per month and I'd gladly pay), it's still a really amazing app without them. A must for if you want to edit each specific parts of a photo better and wow anyone. It can also act as a stepping stone towards the CC desktop version, which is more complicated."
"I love Lightroom. It is hands down the best photo editing software available. Although the mobile version lacks in some aspects when compared to the desktop version, it still gets the job done. It is great for quick edits on the run. The mobile version is easy to learn and navigate. Just poking around for a while will teach you about so many aspects of editing if you do not have much prior experience."
"Great app and computer interface! I took so long to finally download lightroom and was hesitant to pay for it, but it's everything I wanted and more, and worth the monthly subscription. I really like how I can take photos on my phone, edit them on my phone, but also edit them on my computer because they sync to the computer app across a wireless connection. The free presets are awesome, and easily customizable to fit my specific editing needs. Lastly, I love the rating system for photos!"
"This app is exceptionally made. It takes every great thing about the modern desktop program, and condenses it into a super user friendly experience that makes editing photos professionally a breeze, without sacrificing quality, settings, features, or ethos. a transparent and easy to use app with a lot to offer beginner, enthusiasts, and pros alike."
"The app has always been powerful and the perfect syncing between this and my home workstation has always been one of my favorite things about Lightroom. You can make quick edits on the go via the app, and then fine tune them at home, or do it the other way around to share your work on social media apps from your phone. The recent update adding tutorials to the mobile version is icing on the cake, giving you another resource with which to improve your editing skills. 10/10 Highly Recommend"
"I can't believe what I've been missing!! I've been a photographer for many years but this app on my phone is the first time I've used Lightroom. This app is so extensive and feature-rich you can make even photos taken with a cellphone look like you've got the most high-end equipment. I'm seriously blown away! This app has changed my mind from ""Nah, I can do without a Creative Cloud subscription"" to ""Why am I not doing photography full-time?"" This one small app has renewed my passion. Thanks!!!"
It is no doubt a great app. Adobe has put alot of work into including a great base set of raw editing features including local adjustments. I know it will keep evolving and getting more parity in features to classic. Would love to be able to enter location info and contact info on mobile along with some additional editing features like some of the range select tools (color / luminocity).
"I've been using Lr since 2008 in one form or another. It has become an integral part of my workflow. The ability to work seamlessly anywhere on any device/computer via the Creative Cloud has made time management virtually stress free. The one thing the app lacks is the smells of analog photography, but I'm sure I just need to give the development team a little more time."
I have been using Lightroom mobile for many many years now. It's been a long time since I left a review so I thought It's time for an update. Lightroom mobile is amazing. For a phone app it is very pow with many tools. I have learned to edit professionally with this app. I'm still amazed that this much photo editing power is available on my phone.
"All in all it's a great app. I have the premium version and it does not disappoint, however, recently it has been causing my phone to overheat whenever I'm editing pictures. It never did that until about a week ago or so. I recently changed phones and I thought maybe it was the phone that was defective but no, the same thing happens on my new phone. It's really weird."
"Obviously not as widely useful as the desktop version, but still the best app for mobile by a drastic margin. The mobile app is, however, not well optimized for chromebook (Chrome OS). It's kind of a disaster even on my crazy powerful Samsung Galaxy Chromebook (keyword Galaxy). Lots of jittering, freezing, input lag, and crashing. Thanks for adding the range mask options to mobile, it has been great, (on a smartphone, not so my chromebook)."
"Amazing way to consolidate and organize all of. your photos into one place and sort them by capture dates! The only feature I'd really love to see that is annoying when it comes to workarounds, is to be able upload videos from the mobile app, as well as view them on the mobile app. Update: The ability to upload videos from my Android phone has been added! Changing my review from 4 stars to 5 stars."
"I use this app routinely. The attention to detail it allows for is the best I've ever used but there is a very large learning curve. I'm still in that learning curve but the feedback I've received is encouraging and impressive. Within the platform, you can share your edits with other photographers. The likes are a big indicator of 1. You develop a following which indicates who appreciates the work and 2. What photos people tend to enjoy the most. Note: Be patient in learning."
"I had to download this for a photography class to see which photo editing apps were the best and this was by far it! It has a lot of cool features that are still free for use that others typically don't, and the overall results of the photos turn out amazing! I work at the Toledo Zoo and this app allows me to better my photos of all out animals! It truly is amazing and I definitely recommend!"
"Great software to edit photos! I use this on a chromebook, and I've had a few issues launching recently. But they were shortlived! Edit- I've now been using Lightroom for the past 2-3 months. And just a couple weeks ago I perchised the full version for my hobbie of Wildlife photography. I still use this on a Chromebook still, plus a iPhone, and I certinly do NOT regret my upgrade!"
"Lightroom has been a great app for adjusting the photos I've taken to appear more of how they were in the real world when I took them. There is a slight learning curve, but some simple YouTube searches on the subject made the app fairly familiar and after some practice, it is simple to edit photos using Lightroom. I would highly recommend using this app to edit your photos."
"Lightroom is very easy to use and even the free version comes with a majority of the features you will need 90% of the time when editing photos. Tutorials are available for beginners from community photographers which may help you get used to the already easy app. It may not be as thorough as photoshop so professional photographers may find Lightroom inadequate, but it is extremely useful for on the go photo touch ups, social media posts, or simply as a hobby."
"Absolutely wonderful. I haven't wanted to put my phone down since I downloaded it. Shows you incredible photos, the originals and step-by-step details of every edit made. Instantly and profoundly educational. I feel like I've learned as much from this app in one hour than I would by taking a college course."
Now Lightroom is totally new to me yet it acts a lot like Photoshop and in some cases is better than Photoshop. I'm not sure about the learning curve yet but I will grasp it. I was not sure I wanted to pay a monthly fee for a simple app but I did get Photoshop and Lightroom for one simple price. Time will tell but if Adobe stick to its guns it continues to progress these two in combination will be outstanding both on the personal computer and the cell phone. Don't forget has PC users and Android
"Lightroom one of the best photo editing apps of the smartphone . Feature of the apps is very advanced level.However, it would have been better to customize the color grading option so that it could be done wherever you want, but auto color grading does not want to take much time. Due to which one option requires using another software. Those options could also be done in Lightroom if there was a custom option. thank you"
"Wow updating my review because it was fixed. Now the app is great. Thanks! --- OLD REVIEW: Why does the app force full-screen in edit mode? It is an extremely inconvenient ""feature"" that makes the app borderline unusable. All the tools are at the bottom, and so it's very hard to activate the navigation buttons."
Great app for fast editting. it supports most of the functions from the full PC version in a compact package. I really like that you can copy/ paste the settings from one photo to another.
"don't mess around with others. this is most likely what you want. whether or not you like the subscription format, this is the one. ( and I found that if you are subscribing you can use it across devices, rather important, and the setting and libraries are crossed as well.)"
"Great app but the most resent update took away a vital tool, versions. being a photographer its VERY useful to be able to edit the same phot in multiple different styles without filling my archive with the same photo instead of having it all in one"
"This is the best 📷 app for filter fantastics and resolution freaks like myself for free and over blown with feats. I can't recommend this app for pros and casual users, and the star feat is the photo auto correction option that takes a lot of fixing the lighting and guessing work editing time. out of the equation. This is the most hassle free camera app that has more feats than you can ever want, which I love, btw do yourself a favor and try it you won't regret it 😉😀😄😊"
Note to developers: Couldn't be possible to add up Calibration panel in mobile version too ? This is among the most advanced image editors out there right now Especially working with colours and curves are particularly phenomenal and easy to use .Most of the tools are absolutely free. Overall maybe the best one out there
"i love the app, it's very creative and easy to operate. the only problem I experienced was that some features like Masking and Healing were not in premium feature when I wasn't signed in, but immediately I signed in, it was locked under premium feature which is not cool at all. please do something about it.... 😁😎"
"It's nice! Love some of the quick editing features. Also, the easy way to review and tag images while away from the desktop. The syncing part is another story. Not as quick. Sometimes problematic."
Best editing app I have used. The speciality is the photo quality doesn’t decrease if you edit in a proper way. But there are some limitations. You have waste money to remove them. In spite of all of its demerits its merits are more eye-catching. So I would recommend this app for quality editing!
"Light room has to be the finest photo editor that I have ever used. I love all the tools in the app. Lightroom removes blemishes/accentuates colors even in old photos superbly. If you want to enhance/alter your images, Adobe has got it all. I am enjoying Lightroom as much as Photoshop Express."
"Excellent app for mobile photography editing, especially on the raw files. I noticed however a bug maybe that makes the matte effect incorrectly apply to raws taken with S23 ultra expert raw app, please check it. Other then this it does everything I need it to."
"I think lightroom is one of, if not the best photo editing software out there. It's so easy to use and the updates Adobe have made in the last year life profiles and analysing your photographs to give you the best possible edits on your photos making the process so easy! Love the app Adobe!"
"now more happy i can connect camera singing cable and export even raw from my Canon, extra love for that. I'm happy this app keep improving and getting more futures, if there things on your phone that get stuck well need to free space or upgrade device. the app is greatAndroid photo editor."
"just bought the premium version. have been an avid lightroom user as a content creator, now I'm glad I upgraded. this opens up so much of new possibilities and editing options with a truck load of stunning presets to play with. Truly worth it."
"Its always been my go to app for pro light editing on the fly on phone. If you like hands on control of your pictures with extremely refined color editing, this is it."
"I love this app paired with Adobe Capture. I can make svg files this way, and use Silhouette Go, with my Cameo 4. All I have is a Chromebook, so anyone looking for the answer to ""can you use a Cameo 4 with a Chromebook?"" The answer is now, Yes! I have not seen one review on any of these apps that would agree with the answer I have given. I was very discouraged at first, and then adobe apps helped me do what no one thinks is possible. Thanks to the whole crew at Adobe!"
"Lightroom has amazing array of tools. If you spend a bit of time with it, you would find that it is extremely easy to learn and use. My original photos look so much pale in comparison 🫢. Loving it."
"I love, love, love Lightroom. It makes my work so easy. One of my favourite features is the ability to create your own presets, to make for easy editing.😍😍😍"
Makes photo editing simple and the results are better. Done what you want.
"No doubt, the best photo editing and optimisation application 👌. give absolute control to professionals to exhibit their skills."
"accidentally paid for premium, but I tried it and its unreal, would definitely recomend trying it👌🏼 the app without premium is still one of the best photo editing software apps you can get though."
"I use a mixture of lightroom and snapseed, the way I use it works very well for me, it can also read raw files that snapseed doesn't yet support for some reason."
"what other option is there? Lightroom is the best photo editing software. love the mobile version on my s23u, works grest on mac and ipad too. love the cloud service, i can pickup right where i left off on any of my devices."
"amazing. far better than all the others, including Snapseed. perfect, and FREE! Without ads whatsoever. Ammazing!"
This app is dope and it has a lot of stuff that other apps don't have it's good for what I do editing GTA 5 pictures and editing irl car pictures there could be a lot more options but so far it's good!
Even the free edition is robust with featires as well as easy to use. I am impressed having only used it twice and will be upfrading to the pro/premium edition.
"love it! although, since a week, even after a disk clean-up it now won't get past the start-up screen"
"This app is very wonderful, I edit my pictures so beautiful like colours,tint and everything is so perfect but I think they should add more things to this app like making your pictures look like cartoons and some improvement but I rate it 5stars"
"If you're seeking to up your picture editing game, Adobe Photoshop Lightroom is the ideal app for you. With its powerful devices and user interface, you can conveniently edit and also enhance your images and videos. And also, the application is complimentary so there's no reason not to attempt it out!"
This is excellent for product photography. I've always had problems with black clothes looking faded or just weird. In Pro Mode I'm able to make adjustments and my black photos have never looked better. I can edit and then send the picture wherever I need it.
loving the function and the ease of usage! the layout is clean and neat.
super app for making your pics magical and awesome editing feature easy to use and user friendly interface
it's so easy to use and even without premium you still get beautifully edited photos. the presets are a total lifesaver! I love it!
"well build and comprehensive app, haven't been into photography for long but I can already tell this is improving my pictures with little effort"
"Been using Lightroom for more than 2 years now, it's an amazing experience, easy to use either you a beginner or pro"
"so far so good, little tedious getting pictures into the app but once there in, super easy and load straight away rather than waiting. currently playing with the free version seems really good for the moody pictures."
"I Love It! But I think ""Adding Text"" feature should be added, that will make it a super dope editing app. I won't even have to use other editing app anymore"
"can you at least put some ""healing"" feature to repair a picture. Even Snapseed had that feature without buying ""Pro""."
Amazing editing application. All necessary tools for quick mobile phone editing are present. Hoping to try the premium tools soon as well.
"loved it, absolutely amazing software.There are many editing software but this is exceptionally good.Such an user friendly interface that even a newbie can use it."
"Lightroom is such an great application gives an great experience for photography and editing world 🌎 Till now I had edited 4,065 photos . Better to use than other apps . I think it's best choice for editing work ."
Used to think Snapseed was the best editor until I was introduced to this app. Simply the best image editing app available for smartphones. Love the presets and masking features!
"You could put an animation when entering the app. Animation for Android 12, upon login just has a horrible lightroom square with spikes and no input animation."
Editing on the go (your phone) with most of the capabilities that you have on Lightroom Classic saves so much time!
great app! easily adjustments to photo. half the time auto crop and dehaze is everything you need. shhot raw for best results
"Amazing App for photographers, videographers, I have an Instagram account of photography, you can watch my Edition which I did on Lightroom app. @oneplus.salman"
Best photo editor....no cap ....but split tone is not showing in my effects tab 😭....I have checked on Google ....but it's not showing in my own
Always use this app for big events and the learning never stops! There is always something new and exciting lurking within thi app!!
I love the edits it creates. Has made a wonderful job and much easier. Thanks to the creators of Lightroom! :)
"pretty solid editing app. I have a pixel 7 Pro so I have some decent features on my phone with Google photos. This app just allows some nice artistic finishing touches to further enhance lighting or applying a preset. I use the free version, and I don't think I've seen an ad yet."
"I really like that I can sync and edit RAW files from my Pixel 7 Pro, it gives me a lot of flexibility and amazing results. I use this app exclusively for phone photography. On Desktop, I use Lightroom Classic to edit and print photos taken with my Canon mirror less cameras."
Its a little bit hard to understand at first what you can do with it but if you understood it once there is no turning back of editing pictures! Its just a 10/10 and the pictures look very good even if you just use templates.
"This program isn't the easiest to learn without tutorials, but it's hands down the best photo editing software you can find. whether you're working mobile or desktop, you won't find a more tuneable setup."
"All i can say is PROFESSIONAL editing software, majority of it is free, and my camera and lighroom get along VERY well. Its been 2 days and ive gotten some of the most artistic shots, which lightroom has helped me create with the etensive lighting and composition choices available."
"As it's name, this editor works perfectly. You can do anything you want, from editing the contrast to even change colour of objects. Very good editor. If you are new in editing, guidance is also provided here."
"very helpful, normally my camera can't take such high quality pictures, but lightroom allows me to freely manipulate the cameras for whatever situation I need"
Best photo editing app. Need more free features and improvements. Keep it up Adobe❤️
Premium features is worth it! One of the hardest apps when it comes to editing pictures
I love Lightroom on mobile because on my downtime I can edit and send in time after events in a timely manner. Thank to wify and otg cables also
"I am using a free version, and to be honest I am having a good experience. I am using Lightroom on my PC and having some of the same features available on the mobile phones, that's awesome. The in-built filters also helped me many times for a quick color grading. If you are going to use it for commercial use then I would highly prefer you should go for the Premium. I have tried many apps but this was the one which I found out to be most convenient. Thanks!"
"Used it for years on PC and mobile, the mobile version gets better and better with each update and added features."
I'm Photographer and i learned how to edit pictures And video's.... this app is really amazing and auto mode is very useful to new ones ❤
Great app for editing pictures easily. You do not need to open your PC and still unlike other photo editing softwares. This app gives one great control over diffrent aspects of a photo.
Lightroom is my go-to app for quick and quality photo edits. 5+ years in and it's still great!
"Best tool for editing photos, everything you need is for free. Highly recommend."
"...as a fast learner, it's very nice app, actually this is my 3rd try to install, now I'm happy that I can able to make my own preset, needs a lot of understanding, at least it's a rewarding for myself, eventhough not as good as compared to the pro ones, but ""I Love It"", no need to buy preset."
"Very useful application for editing with my AKASO Brave camera, specially for color grading and correction. Although I am using the free version, it already been enough for me to use since the essentials are still there with no charge."
"This is my most preferred editing app. I use this most of the time, if not all the time. I like the range of presets it has and I like that I can edit RAW images on the app. I had a problem with one of the functions they had changed and within a few days the problem (with the exporting option) was resolved. Thanks Adobe. You guys keep giving me reason to stay using your app."
"Really REALLY good however hard to understand how everything works for us newbies, I'm loving the tutorials though and I need to keep learning. Feature rich too! Now let's see if this 51 year old woman can erase time using this app! 😂"
Pretty impressive app to edit and make a good picture like a pro editor within some clicks and it's very easy to edit. As I experienced with this app. My suggestion is that everyone should download and install it 😊😎😎
an app where you can finely tune your photo with many options. almost like grading a diamond...
Discribe to develop pannel. I think it is more important than update the app. Please develop the server and do avilable the premium function for all
"Too many premium options, I would be glad if they made the masking preset for free."
Awesome app! Though one thing that could be added. I ususally shoot in RAW portrait mode and I always have to rotate photos one by one inside application (as they are uploaded in landscape orientation). On PC version of lightroom it is possible to mark all photos you want to rotate and simply do it by right click - rotate. I think this would be far more practical if it was enabled on mobile app as well.
"It's a very good app, and a great addition to the desktop based main version. Great to be able to export/tweak batch edits left unfinished from home. Only addition I would make would be to improve the UI a little with regard for folder selectability & clearer preference controls. Overall a great and strong app. Although only recommended for high end phones as it certainly eats a lot of RAM & battery power."
"The best photo editing app I've ever used. The only thing I'm not fond of is how long it takes to download a color corrected video. Other than that, it's amazing, especially if you subscribe and get the features"
By far the best streaming service out there! Great selections on not only movies but tv shows. I don't even mind the little commercials. I would pay to not have them...but I love the fact you don't have to. Especially with the wide selections of amazing films!! 10 out of 10 would (and have) recommend!! The actual service is solid no lag no freezing and doesn't take up space on my device! I am a Tubi stan all the way!!
"Had an issue with the rewind and advance icon with line being in middle of screen and coming on a lot! I told them about it and they didn't get it fixed the first time, but a lot better, and they responded, but the second time, corrected it, and again following up to see if it was fixed. Well done! Very good app !!"
"Awesome, clear,full length, movies. I love this app. It is perfect for a kool get-away in the middle of the hectic work week or anytime! It has a below average amount of ads. Its a keeper! **Almost a whole year later & I am 100% satisfied. This is my all time fav app. It is structured to be easily navigated. The only tiny thing I would do would be give a pause on the movies to read the description before allowing it to start. It's perfect! Get this app. You won't be sorry."
"Just downloaded Tubi again since I upgraded my phone plan and have a better data plan. Tubi used to be my go to for free movies, and now is, once again, my go to! Tubi offers a great selection of movies, both old and new, and I love being able to find movies from my childhood that no other app offers...I guess because they are older, like old Jim Carrey movies, and other great comedies from the 90's! The ads aren't intrusive or set up to interfere during essential plot features. Love this app!!!"
"Absolutely phenomenal app. If you don't mind experiencing ad breaks every twenty minutes or so, this app contains one of the biggest varieties of movies available. It ranges from bug blockbusters of the past decade to nearly forgotten classics to exploitation films. New titles are frequently uploaded so the app always stays fresh and interesting. I would highly recommend tubi, because even if you end up disliking something you watched, nothing beats the low, low price of zero dollars."
"Really enjoy Tubi. Yeah Ads but not too invasive, have noticed it'll break at a good point to do so. Definitely not as many Ads as you would get on regular TV or even other prime online services you choose to watch for free. Tubi also doesn't edit content. Update: Still a fan of Tubi bout a year later. Tubi has great movies and shows for free. Still Ads in short intervals (like 60 sec or less), still in appropriate places to not ruin the show or movie."
I found some of the coolest movies 🍿🥤 on this app. Movies for all ages 😁. And all different types. Some of the movies I found are the best ones because it is hard for me to watch all of the way through but others I actually love. They really kept my attention and even though they have some commercials they were short and I was able to get back into the movie like they were never there. Thanks for putting the coolest movies for everyone to see on our devices for free!!! 😊
"I love it, highly recommend! I absolutely love to binge watch true crime which Tubi allows me to do because they have SO MUCH to choose from! The documentaries and interviews are very detailed and put together so well and keeps u glued. The ads r VERY reasonable. Not every freaking 2 or 3 minutes that last 2 or 3 minutes! Definitely not greedy folks behind this app. Only thing I wish is that there were more free episodes of Dateline because nobody tells a suspense story like Keith Morrison."
"The app is great, the UI is clean, straight forward, and simple. I have had no issues with any lag or any type of hiccups, the ads aren't to long and considering I am watching movies for free I can live with the ads. The movies constantly change, and you will definitely find something great to watch! 10/10"
"I have found Tubi to be a very surprisingly nice app to install. There is a plethora of great viewing content to be enjoyed. From new modern movies and TV shows, to classic and even obscure titles. Even many movies labeled as having a ' cult following ', can be found right here on Tubi. Thank you for the accessable and simple app, that once you chose your video it plays with few interrupted scenes.No need but to sit back and enjoy. I recommend Tubi to anyone who is looking for video content"
"Honestly, blown away with the amount of quality movies and shows that they offer on here for free! I haven't downloaded it for years now bc I thought it was all B grade movies, but I was totally wrong! Also, ADs are shorter and less frequent than Amazon, and I pay for that! Overall, I am very impressed."
"(2021) It seems to be a great app. The movies that I watch are as good as Netflix, Crackle, Vudu, and the likes. Works on android and am able to cast to the TV. I tell all my friends about Tubi. (2023) Still working good. Just like Netflix, there are moments when the sound doesn't mesh with the movie. So, I just shut it down and restart. Whenever I get a chance, I send movies to all my friends."
"I uninstalled the app awhile ago(don't remember why), recently I reinstalled it and I'm glad I did. It's got a lot of good shows and movies. There are a few shows I wish it had, but all of which are owned by companies like Netflix so Tubi can't really have them on their app. Which I understand. My only really ""issue"" is that there isn't a variety of ads. I normally I don't mind ads but I've seen the same ones many times now. Otherwise it's a great FREE app is a variety of shows and movies."
"Love this app. It has a great selection of movies and it is all free. The app shows you how long the commercials will be and I do not find them to be too long. The app remembers where you are in the movie if you need to pause it, midshow, and resume watching another day. You also can save favorites you find in the app so you can easily find them later."
"I only have good things to say about this app. I've been using it for years, I love the free shows and movies, (plus commercials most of the time are super short). A lot may be older, but I think that's what makes it great. There's been a bunch of older movies I've been wanting to watch for years that I've found on here, finally crossing them off my ""Watch it list"". Plus old TV shows that I completely missed, but am finally able to see 😊"
"Great app! Have been watching Tubi for quite some time and haven't had a problem with it. Great variety of TV shows, reality shows and competitions, movies, old shows that I watched growing up, etc that you don't necessarily find on other apps all for free! I don't have any cable/TV, wifi, so this app is great. I use my phone or tablet with Hotspot so this is perfect for me. There are no more ads than what you would get watching cable."
"This app is absolutely fantastic. There's so much stuff on here that people actually WATCH, and it's in the free version... The minute-long ad breaks are annoying, but they're infrequent and to be expected with a free app. Overall, the best streaming app with the most relevant watch selections I've ever used. Free beats out Netflix, Hulu, Prime, etc and the selection is amazing for not having to pay for a subscription"
"Idk why so many ppl write in saying they have all these tech issues. I think it must be their device(s) wherein the problem lies. This app is fantastic & so easy to use plus it really is 100% free! I don't have the newest, greatest, fastest mobile phone & don't own a PC or laptop either yet I have zero problems watching anything I want, when I want, on my mobile or using Chromecast. Go ahead, get this app & use it for awhile. What do you have to lose, right? I highly recommend!"
"It's a great app!!! Great selection and I love the overall experience. I often find myself browsing this over other streaming apps because of the platform layout and again, the great selection. The only suggestion I would make is to have a brightness slider to adjust brightness to my liking."
They have almost every genre you can think of and all the oldie but goodies movies. They even have one of a kind type movies that you've never heard of and people's passion projects as well. Love that it's free! I don't mind the ads at all it feels like how it was when you would watch a movie on cable as a kid and the commercials you would use to do the little stuff like refilling the snack and bathroom breaks so it's nostalgic that way. Overall love the app and service!
"Wonderful shows! Great movies! Not too many commercials. 😊 Other apps, that you have to pay for, have much slower streaming speeds for some reason, but I've never had a problem with Tubi. Tubi just keeps getting better. I would give more than 5 stars if I had the option. Edit: A year later, and I'm still happy. The interesting thing is that this is one of the very few apps that don't get worse when they're updated, including apps for businesses. A pay raise is in order."
"Full films, less commercials! Tubi has a minimal number of advertisements per show, and there are no more than 2 per break. I am able to see a movie without losing the story's continuity due to so many ""commercial breaks."" I am also pleased that there are so many excellent independent films. Give Tubi a try!"
"Good selection of genres, TV shows, and movies. I have done some analysis, and early findings are that Tubi has far fewer ads and ad breaks, than Pluto. On the order of 25 to 50% fewer. Additionally, the ads are much less annoying! It is a noticeable and dramatic difference to the viewing experience!"
"Incredibly good streaming service. There are a moderate number of ads, but they're placed at minimally intrusive intervals and even have a warning in advance. Tubi has a reputation for their so bad it's good deep cuts, but if you dig into their catalog, you'll find an incredibly large selection of great movies (especially if you're a genre, classics, or international indie film fan). The thirty day cycle helps me to make sure content actually gets watched."
"I've been using this app before it got popular. I'm just afraid it'll become another mainsteam paid app like Netflix, disney+, hulu, paramount+, HBO, etc. It has all the shows/movies I can find (whenever it pops up). For me, I love watching horror movies, & when I couldn't find ""itchi the killer,"" it was nowhere to be seen on any of the other mainstream apps👀 not even HBO had it. A few months passed & boom! There it was on tubi. I don't mind the ads at all. This app is definitely worth it."
I really enjoy this app!! Movies are clear! The whole movie plays. I've only had to restart a movie a few times after turning it off to do something an then pressing resume it starts it over but it's easy to fast forward to where I was. I love it. Thank you Tubi for the free movies.
Kicks me out sometimes and I have to re-enter but honestly that's probably just my phone as I have the same issue with other apps. Not fond of the commercials but can't complain considering it's free. The best selection I've seen from any of the streaming services I've used. Warns you when stuff is going soon. Actually saves my lists unlike other streaming services that claim to. User friendly. My favorite app. Thank you Tubi. My favorite App. Edit: No longer been kicking me out. Fave App.
"Bazilians of shows for free. So there are some ads. Meh. The ads seem to be grouped together but less intrusive. The selection ranges from some cool recent releases - to tons of cool not so recent releases - to well... things less widely known. There are movies, documentaries (including concerts) and TV series. Pretty good chance you'll find a TV series that knocks you all the way back to childhood."
"Tubi is GREAT!! I HIGHLY recommend this streaming service! I have seen so many amazing genres in movies, tv shows, documentaries, true crime...etc. There is something for everyone! I love it! I don't mind the ads in between and some don't even have ads. If there are ads, they go by so quickly, I barely notice them. Once again, I HIGHLY recommend this streaming app service! You REALLY won't be disappointed!!🥰 As an advid movie/tv watcher, I guarantee it!"
"I love the selection of FREE tv series and movies! Yes, there are a few commercials, but they are fairly short. The app allows you to pick and choose the season and the episode you'd like to watch, as well as the ability to rewind or fast forward. This makes watching everything as convenient as watching a dvd! The only thing I do not like with some tv series, is that they do not all have, all of the seasons with each series. I do like that they notify you what series and movies will be leaving."
"I think it's so easy to use and it has adds you can't skip (i can only remember two commercial breaks per 1-2 hour movie), compared to you tubes 3 or 4 adds per 10 minute video by the time your done skipping ads you would have already been back to watching your show/movie. I'm not even exaggerating. It's awesome you have nothing to loose and you will literally just get something for nothing."
"Pretty good for a free app. It's much better than when it first started. Tubi has gotten better at where they break with ads (Freevee has way more ads). I dont mind the break; it's short enough to not get me mad, n long enough to get up n do things. I've been able to see many movies n TV shows that I missed. I noticed I'm watching Tubi more than Netflix n Prime Vid."
"This is great, I can watch free shows without paying anything. Unlike antenna TV the ad breaks are only a minute long instead of multiple minutes. I've even found some good shows and movies that I enjoyed through this. It's free so that makes it very valuable to me. I would recommend to give it a try. There is nothing to lose and you might like it."
Awesome free movies. I love this app! You hardly even notice the ad interruption. Quality streaming virtually no buffering. I highly recommend for people cutting out cable and satellite TV. Streaming is the only way to fly. Another plus they turn down the volume on the few advertisements instead of up as most other network's commercial interruptions. Tubi is still the best streaming app!!!!!🥳👍
"Tubi has gone the route that the OG hulu had where ads paid for most of the shows/movies. It has a refreshingly wide variety of content, oftentimes, meaning if I can't find it on the mainstream streaming services, I will find it on Tubi. The app is clearcut, simple logical interface, sleek, quick to load. I also like that registration is optional and used to give you recommendations instead of forcing them on you and limiting your experience."
"Excellent choice of movies and shows...short, spread out commercial breaks. Very good experience. They had movies I always have trouble finding and, after watching one that's 90 minutes long, I believe it only stopped for 3 or 4 commercials and they were less than a minute long. 5 stars. P.s. I'm a real customer and this is a real review. No B.S."
"I have been on this app for years, and I have been recommending this app to almost everyone I know. I wish there was a way that the commercials are to a minimum of 1, it can be annoying when you watching a favorite movie and the commercial pops up, really no different than the television so no complaintson compliments"
"I initially downloaded the app just to watch a movie but ended up keeping it after seeing the selection of movies they offer. I really like that they offer foreign movies, especially Korean and Japanese. The movies play smoothly and the ads aren't unbearable. I really love this app and it's my go-to for movies now!"
"I love Tubi because it's a great, free movies and TV app. Yes! ...I finally found a winner for free entertainment with a limited number of short breaks for advertisements. There're many movies, documentaries, and other types of entertainment not found on other apps. It has a wide variety of genres. I don't mind their commercials because they're very limited and certainly worth it!! Therefore, Yubi earns the coveted 5-STAR rating!!"
"Tubi is the best app to watch movies TV shows and news. Im so relieved to have finally stop looking for a TV movie app that not always full of ads. It's easy to use and has so much more movies than redbox,Netflix Amazon prime Disney. I can keep going. Thank you for this awesome entertainment app. My search is finally over. Definitely worth 5 stars."
I didn't have any problems with the movie I watched buffering. It came in clear and good quality unlike alit of other apps like this. And the commercials were okay there were not to many of them. Most apps like this you get more ads and commercials than movie. But Tubi is diffrent. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys watching TV or Movies
"Tubi is a great, especially considering it's free to use. They have a very eclectic offering with lots of great foreign films of every genre. I think the picture and sound quality are excellent and the commercial breaks are infrequent and short. Much less than Freevee. Given my somewhat bohemian tastes, I like this service as much or more than Netflix."
To my surprise I find that Tubi has a large selection of movies and they cover the World Cup also. Well actually what surprised me was how the ads don't bother me much. When it does go to ads it's takes right around a minute. Well short of what we have to put up with on cable television these days. I wish they had ever movie I want to view but that would be impossible but they keep adding new ones and I haven't been able to run out of ones that they do have that I want to watch.
"I just love that Tubi has all the movies that I grew up watching and new stuff too. It has so many great shows as well. There of course are ads but they aren't more than a minute long and there's not that many. They play them at good times too, not right smack in the middle of a scene, always at a closing scene. It doesn't completely throw off the show or movie. 5/5 stars!"
Tubi is amazing ! My phone sucks and my connection is worse. And still movies stream excellent ! There is an occasional problem with the audio and I have to exit and start again. Some movies have volume level issues. There are lots of good movies and fairly good TV shows... It's not perfect but it's damn good.
My favorite place to stream movies and shows. I would have signed up for multiple different premium streaming services by now if it weren't for the great selection of movies and shows as well as lack of excessive ads. This is absolutely worth the price of free and I would recommend anyone check it out before subscribing to a premium streaming service.
"I downloaded Tubi about 2 weeks ago. So far, I've found a lot to watch. Minimal ads, considering the app is free. It's been a couple of months since I downloaded Tubi. I have been impressed by the selection. I'm always able to find something that catches my interest. Supplemental: It's been about 2 years now, since I first discovered Tubi. I also use Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, Crackle, Pluto, Amazon Prime & YouTube. All very good services. Without a doubt, Tubi is my favorite streaming app. Stillis"
"Best media app and it's FREE. So many varied types of programs. Brilliant search, save and predictive interest algorithms. Save your own list for future viewing that's easy to access. Programs are far superior to HBO-Max which is free with my service provider but costs $10 if I switch. Haven't watched HBO since I found TUBI. Only wish there was more time in each day so I could watch more."
This app has allowed me to watch my choice of all the sci-fi movies I can handle without any transmission interruptions. I like being able to easily pause and resume playing the flicks. I do not have cable for my TV and the over-the-air TV reception really sucks here where I live. Tubi movie watching on my Galaxy tablet makes my day!
I love the fact that thier is a big selection on 90s 80s movies you cant find on Netflix. The commercials are not that not long. I would definitely pay for a premium Tubi if they had one with no commercials. It's not hard looking for something to watch because good movies pop up as soon as you open the app. Plus best of all no hassle to sign up. Love this app
"I really enjoy Tubi because the shows and movies are free to watch. A lot of anime that I'm interested in is on Tubi . Additionally, the advertisements aren't overbearing. It also lets you watch something in the background on phone, which is really convenient. The quality is very good and so are the subtitles and audio."
"The commercials used to be better - they're easily 2-3x longer and more intrusive than they used to be. Content is unmatched for quality of older titles...which is exactly the content I want. I would opt into a paid tier, without hesitation, and I feel it is legitimately the only service I need year round."
"I love this app, I can turn somthing on and fall asleep wake up and something else interesting is playing on the screen. I like how the app make really good selections for you based off what you were already watching. not to mention yhe non stop new selection that pop up everytime I turn the app back on, and I have the option of picking up where I left off or exploring something new, the options are endless. Thank you to the creators. p.s. even with comercials, they are short and non repetative."
No better streaming app for movies and tv shows for free period! I paid a ridiculous amount of money for cable with basic channels for a long time. I was literally bored trying to navigate what to watch. Tubi took the guessing out of it all and gave me favorite content instantly. Needless to say cable has been removed..Tubi moved in. Get it. You won't be disappointed.
Excellent free movie streaming. Yes there are commercials but not so many to ruin the experience. Good selection each month of mainstream and obscure movies. And you can save movies for future viewing. For what you pay ( NOTHING) its a better value than cable or satellite in my opinion.
"I LOVE-LOVE Tubi! I've been able to catch up on Must-See movies, from 1 to almost 40 year old goodies. I mean, Goodfellas, Devil's Advocate AND Roadhouse, hidden gems featuring Morgan Freeman, in a single month. Good suggestions based on what you like! Great TRUE CRIME shows & documentaries as well! My only feedback is, commercials cut in at odd times, and pick up right where cut-off was, without adding the last second. Other than that, I love Tubi and can always find something to watch!"
"A bloody great alternative to the most famous streaming platforms, especially if you are searching for old movies or even not that old. Prob one of the best Free alternative where to enjoy a planty of movie without invasive adds on the app itself, and only a few during the vision, called break; tho nothing that long waiting so far. I really recommend it."
"best video streaming app out of our Netflix, Amazon prime, (the two latter have automatic play and the auto audio start which we HATE and can't turn off!) AND hulu because not only is the app super easy to use, and has excellent selection of older movies, and best thing ever is that its FREE! and you can't beat that!"
"Almost just like the Tubi website on the computer, except in app form. The live TV preview window below the recommended section can be annoying, but it isn't intrusive like the 1 on Pluto TV is. Ads are fine too, just like they are on the Tubi website - much less of those compared to regular TV. And you get all that for free, so I'm loving it... 👍😍"
"Tubi is by far the the easiest, least obtrusive free video streaming app. They have the best mixture of old and new variety of movies and television shows, spanning all the way back to the 1930's. This IS the video streaming app that I recommend to everyone I talk to."
"probably the best free streaming experience you can get. i personally like it because of all the horror b movies, but there's a solid amount of other great movies and shows, too. the interface is also really nice and feels premium for something that's completely free."
"Who needs cable! You are the best. I especially like the ""My Stuff"" option. I can always go to my favorites. I especially like your historical and religious offerings, series and documentaries. Your recommended movies are very helpful to find new favorites. Letting us know when a movie is leaving is considerate and gives us final chance to see it. Thank you!!!"
"Easy to use. Navigating the menu, and finding a flick. Ads are tolerable. About only one commercial (20-30 secs long every 10 minutes. I would only use it though, if you have wi-fi. It eats data for lunch. I watch it on my phone while gaming. Good app."
"You have to check out tubi! So many great shows and movies, all free! The app I found to be very user friendly, and it keeps track of your programs, so you can finish it later. You can't lose!! Check it out.❤️"
Amazing content never any interruptions I could do without the commercials but then again. I mean Hey it is a gift and they take all in all. I love this app and I refer it out to all of my friends and family.I am very appreciative Also for this app they have amazing movies. It is great all around for young children middle aged or elderly. Keep up the good work you have a customer for life!
"Nice one. Has alot selection of movies and TV series. I don't mind the advertisement, since they're short, probably takes about 1-2minutes the most. It's free so can't complain. Would definitely recommend it."
"I enjoy watching movies & shows I never knew existed. It's Awesome! However less ads will be nice, either shorten the amount of times they show up, or the length to like 30 seconds each time. Or both,but overall great App"
"It's basically like watching basic cable, but for the price of your phone bill. I love the variety of movies. And, with anything digital and streaming, unless you pay a monthly fee, there are always commercials. But that's life, consumerism and capitalism."
"Love it!! I watch Tubi more than Amazon Prime video and Netflix. The categories section is so easy to navigate and select what you want. My favorite genre is Thrillers and drama, and the choices are really good - - new and older movies. 👍🏻😁"
🚨STOP LOOKING FOR FREE MOVIE🚨 Download/ sign up/ get free movies and this is not a lie and best part is that you get new movies every single month. Really Old and new movies too. You have a time limit until the movie goes off the platform but with recording apps you can literally just record. Who really wants to pay for movies when you can get them free. I'd try this out for a few months found some good movies I wanted but didn't want to pay for them... Now they are mine. No $$$ 5🌟🔥
"The app is still great in that it has great movies and shows. the commercials are not that long and are few to have one, not loose concentration. I like the highlights that it has been showing for FIFA world cup."
I absolutely LOVE Tubi!! I'm 54 and I love old movies! I'm talking movies from the 3o's and up. Tubi has the BEST SELECTION of old movies out of all the FREE movie sites!! I don't mind the ads because I get to see old movies I wouldn't normally get to see. Makes it worth a few ads. Still not as many ads as regular TV! 🤣🤣🤣
"I love tubi! I've watched almost all of my favourite horror movies (old & new) and the tubi originals are great too! The ads aren't long at all, shorter than TV commercials and they don't happen at crucial parts of the movie unlike some other apps."
"I love it!! It's got tons of classic shows on there that I can't find anywhere else. Also whenever I watch Tubi on my phone, I haven't had any problems with buffering or not getting a connection It always works!"
"I'm not one to rate apps, although I cannot count how many people I have already recommended Tubi to, minus well do it on here too😄. I love Tubi, there are a wide variety of movies, and I just finished The Hunger Games series so I highly recommend Tubi. There are shows as well, Dateline is always interesting, you do have to filter out some of the movies but generally it's an amazing selection."
"I just downloaded it a couple of hours ago a friend of mine recommended it last year and I'm just now getting it downloaded and checking it out List of movies is pretty amazing, lots of good movies I haven't seen in a long time. If the commercials don't get any worse than they were tonight I will enjoy this app. God bless America."
surpassing my expectations significantly with its selection! I'm a huge movie big and was surprised to find many movies I've never heard of or had hard time finding. plus they really only show one commercial break that goes by really quick! I'm a fan for sure & now I'm hooked! 🐰
THE BEST ENTERTAINMENT APP THATS FREE. No other app can compare to TUBI I highly recommend Tubi to anyone who has a smartphone tablet or smart TV. It's free with ads (of course) but tubi in my opinion has one of the best selection for the moives buffs and complete series for those who like to binge watch. And I know there's alot more if moives and shows aren't your thing there's sports and live TV streaming available FOR FREE. So download for free Tubi and stop wasting money on the other apps.
"Tubi tv is great for someone that wants to watch a movie, without being hooked up to a T.V. which you can do with Tubi tv too. I prefer to sit at my kitchen table with my coffee and pick a movie out of the many choices a person could be offered. Series programs, Tubi has them. Horror old and new movies, everything is so easy to find. I seriously wish I'd have put this Tubi tv app on my phone years ago. So many movies!"
I love Tubi. Great movie options. User friendly. Never experienced technical problems. Streaming from my phone is simple. Infrequent ads that are less than 30 seconds. Not bad for free movies.
"Love Love Love this app! Tons of variety, majority of the tv shows & movies are super new. Plus (my favorite attribute by far), when watching selected show or movie there arent 1000's of commercial adverts interrupting what youve selected every 5-10 mins!"
People tried it say a lot of different stuff about tubi but to be honest... I think Toby is a perfect app due to the fact of so many different categories options for movies TV shows live TV you name it yes there's always going to be stuff that you don't like well all you have to do is put a thumbs-down for the stuff you do like thumbs up and you'll get more stuff that relates to it I truly appreciate and a fan of this app so for anybody that has anything bad to say about Tubi 🤐👌🏼
"It is a free (of uneatable glitches) user friendly app, with enough exclusive and other content that works with casting very comfortably, ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO CONNECT AND DISCONNECT ALL THE TIME AS MAIN STREAMING APPS DO, ON PURPOSE TO AVOID FREE STREAMING TO BE A RECURRENCE. LOVE IT, AND ITS CONTENT."
VERY good app! I thought this was a glitchy/ low budget app based on the way my Vizio TV was NOT loading it for viewing. Considering this app came built in to my TV you would think it would work better than casting the app to my TV from my mobile device but I was SO WRONG! And man am I glad lol good job guys please don't change a thing! Maybe more movies & tv shows but that's it! Haha! Edit: how DARE YOU FOOLS REMOVE THE NANNY?!?! WHAT DO I DO NOW? JUST SIMPLY UNINSTALL? MY HEART IS HURTING
"Tubi brings a large variety of movies, documentaries,TV ,news and more such as forgien films ,Spanish movies. They have thumps up or down selection. A place to keep your favorites. They give such quality in the sound and picture.At times there are so many great movies to choose from. There are times you wish for the new choices ,yet you should search for there are gems that one can miss. There is an auto continue watch list. My one neg. finish a movie as it still auto to contiue list."
"If i could i would give it 5☆ The fact that is a free TV and Movie site it's AWESOME! There are a lot of great shows and movies I loved growing up that I find on here. I probably use Tubi the most for TV and movies. The ads aren't horrible considering it's free viewing but in my eyes what will keep it at a 4☆ for me is the Damm"" Auto Play or Play Next Feature I can't turn it off and I miss some awesome end music with the credits. Thanks - Tubi - that option( skip/ no skip) Awesome !!!"
"Tubi has a selection unparalleled in free of cost format. The quality of, both, picture, sound, clarity are astonishing when compared to other sites with free content all with a lesser quality. Lastly, there is no click-bait on Tubi. what you see is exactly what you'll get and nothing less. The programs and their descriptions available while browsing films. Thanks Tubi.."
Sorry to see other people having trouble with the App. My personal experience has been very good. Hopefully these people will get an updated version that works for them because they are truly missing out on a fantastic bunch of movies!
"I enjoy watching the movies, I like the documentary shows, all around it's a great channel. I wish there was less commercials, other than that I am very happy! Yes I would definitely recommend it to a friend in anyone else! *****⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"I enjoy this app quite a bit. Yes there are a lot ads and commercials, but it is free...so how can you beat that? You can't, so no complaining, search around there is plenty to watch that is very entertaining for everyone . Grab a couple apps that cost a hair under $20 monthly to find a lot newer stuff and more movies...but keep Tubi around for the times when there just isnt anything on the ""pay for"" apps. I applaud Tubi...keep up the good work!"
Absolutely great with all your favorite TV shows to be nice if they threw some game shows in like the class of Joker's Wild with host Jack Barry and Tic Tac dough with host Wink Martindale I like seeing the credits I wish I could do something about always having to click a button if you're always watching an episode that you want to see the credits unless you press another button they should just keep showing the credits instead of giving you an option every time I love the network keep it up
Absolutely love this app. The range of films and shows is brilliant especially if you like the old horror flicks with Vincent price. Only problem I have is that app doesn't allow for background play on Android while it allows it on ios. I would appreciate it if they could fix this issue and again 5 stars
"Movie I just watched""Hitman"" for me is extremely professional, the characters or the players and the script that they played, music or the sound effects equaled to the video it showed on the screen. Excellent!!"
Love the improvement they have made! Just one thing I would love to see Tubi TV have. The choice to mark the channels that are your fav. The live TV is kicka**! Also the wait in between commercial movies/shows the elevator music and countdown is kind of lame also the few commercials they replay replay over and over a bit too much they get sickening 🤬😡🤮🤢🤢🤧💯💯🤮🤮🤯🤯😵‍💫😵😖😲😳🤒🤥🤕🤕🤕🤕🤮🤮🤮🤯🤯😲😵‍💫😵😵‍💫😵😵‍💫😲😲🤮🤮
"It was great! Although Tubi doesn't have as many movies and shows, I would desire it's free, and there are very minimal ads! I just enjoyed watching It Chapters 1 and 2, and I want to thank Tubi for the experience! I also love war movies, and I am glad with the wide selection of them! Thank you so much Tubi!"
"A lot better than other streaming services now. I don't mind commercials if it means being able to watch something decent for once. Great app, easy to navigate."
"This app is simply amazing, you can use it on your phone, tablet, smart tv, gaming console and PC. You would be crazy not to download it, why pay for tv when you can get it %100 free?!!! And it has minimum ads less than most payed streaming services but don't just take my word for it download it now and see for yourself you won't be disappointed!!!!!!"
"More great content than even the paid apps! The commercial breaks are tolerable and reasonable. I also like that they use ""out with the old, and in with the new"", keeping content fresh."
"I really like tubi. It has some wonderful old movies and TV shows that you don't get to see on any other app I've seen, and they're constantly new old movies being put on here. that are from my childhood movies and TV shows I enjoyed and it's just very nostalgic."
I have been watching movies & series & standup comedians on Tubi for so long! If this was Netflix I wouldn't be leaving a review. I would've left disappointed a long time ago. I had a subscription a couple of times. I felt cheated. I am thankful to have found Tubi. But why all this talking.. There is so much to see!!
"awesome,finally a stand alone app to watch my favorite shows at a very reasonably price and to watch on other devices without the extra charge, very well done guys, hope you keep it like that!!! Don't change a thing!!! Keep up the awesome work!!! I don't think it needs a different rating....i think it's just an awesome and fantastic app!!!! thank you for finally coming out with a stand alone app you don't have to pay an arm and leg for!!!!lol now I've got all channels and tv for about 62.00...."
So far it's a great app with a lot more options than the old Epix app. I'm enjoying the selection that MGM+ is offering this far.
"works exactly as expected. not rating the content, just functionality."
"App is great, some good and very good shows. Definitely better that prime video or netflix"
Great original series and selections.
"OMG OMG OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY AWESOME MOVIES THIS APP HAS FOR FREE!!! THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE APP, FORGET NETFLIX AND FORGET HULU FORGET ALL THE REST CAUSE MGM IS THE VERY BEST!!!!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!! #1 APP EVER!!!"
"love the variety of movies offered, plays smooth and clear!!"
"last night was my first night if my free trial and love it!!! You have to see the show called ""FROM""."
very compelling and frightening. the War of the Worlds. Good variety of streaming options. one of the better apps available .
Really enjoying the selection of shows.
the whole world needs to get this do not watch cable anymore same thing you got on cable you can watch on the app I got all kind of apps to watch TV on now the only thing you need is a hotspot or Internet and also you can screen it to your TV if you know how to do it
"I got this through Domino's. Honestly I was hoping for something where I could access and watch movies or shows quickly without having to scroll through a lot. This clearly does that. It puts the best content front and center, while having a deeper catalogue to dive through at leisure."
can watch all my favorite shows anywhere I'm at.
"it's a very good Channel all of the good up-to-date TV shows, and also premium movies!"
I hesitated to get epix because I already have to skip some months on other streaming apps to be able to keep up with new seasons of my favorite shows. So far I am enjoying epix immensely. I appreciate that the subtitles work for everything. I have hearing issues and other apps don't always provide subtitles.
"This is hands down the worst movie app going. Its crazy to try to cancel it. I have sent 10 emails trying to not only cancel it; but get refunds for 2 months they charged me for after I cancelled it. There is no way you can call them. The burden will fall on the consumer. I guess you have to change your banking info. It seems they dont care, witch tells us it's a scam. Do your self a big favor and do not come close to Epix. Really bad for most other apps as well. Thanks Mike Fattaleh"
It would be good if you offered that 30 day trial for people like me that signed up for the 7 day trial when this released back then. Back then I had buffering problems and with that i could not stream properly. Thanks for reading and the selection it's quite good for $5.99 a month. I think it's worth it. Honestly.
"The selection of titles is pretty 👍 The app is easy to use, but the only thing it does weird for me is when I lock my phone with the app open it acts like I have no internet after unlocking my phone. So I have to close and reopen it to continue watching."
"I love movies and some don't play until a certain date but now I just get my phone and pick out my movie that is not available ON-DEMAND and I just Chromecast it to my T.V. and enjoy the movie. I think with my GOLD PACKAGE through SuddenLink should have any movie that they show should be available to watch ON-DEMAND but like I said, some movies have a date it comes on and you can just record it or watch it live. I think all boxes should be available to record from for the money they charge!!!!"
I like the EPIX NOW App alot. it's easy to manage and there is alot of great TV shows and older plus newer movies. You can also see the preview of the movie before you watch it which helps alot and if you have a movie or show that you like on the EPIX NOW app and want to come back to it later to watch it just click that you like it and add it to your list and you can come back anytime to see it. THANKS EPIX NOW APP LOVE IT..BRANDI
"Works great with my new Google Chromecast TV as downloaded it from the Google play store, and also have the APP inside my phone and tablets..I have no problem whatsoever, I'm very happy with the APP working with my different Android devices, no issues!"
This app show good quality movies.
"First off the bat, I discovered a series I loved from a few years ago that I had almost forgotten about."
"Nice selection of movies, though small. Streaming from the app and casting to my Chromecast was always seamless. Signed up via a free trial from Domino's. I never subscribed through Google Pay, so I was never charged."
"Excellent immediate customer service. If you are doing the promo through Dominos, don't panic- you aren't subscribed/ you dont have to cancel; you aren't charged and access goes away after the 30 days. I've got a screen shot f the conversation with Ben from their customer service."
Nice app and has good shows on here.
no adds or buffering best app out there
great movies no commercials
Great app. Movies and shows are fantastic. I am really enjoying this MGM+.
Different name...yes...but same GREAT movies and series!!
This is a great 👍 app for Mobile TV 📺
I love it I've been binge watching for a few hours
this app has some amazing shows to watch
very awesome movies wide selection
Love the app and all the cool shows it has.. just one problem it keeps freezing on me for some reason
it has good movies it's a good app to stream shows that you haven't seen in a long time
"Great movies & TV shows, for an low price. Thank you 👍 🥃"
"Its Great! But It could have way more current tv shows and movies that are not available in other leading streaming apps, if it had way more I would make it go from great to awesome!"
I have never watch Epic before. When I did I really enjoyed it. And I also like the selections of Originals also movies a lot different from what I've had in Cable in the past. And yes I would recommend to a friend.
you app rocks ! it so easy to access any movies an down load them
"I don't share in the recent negative reviews. This works perfectly for me and on my Roku TV. I'm using a Samsung phone. & a 60in Hisense Roku TV. Godfather of Harlem is a great show, and Chaplewaite."
People who review this app with a 1 star don't even know how to use 100 percent of a phone lol love it got me hooked
"This App ""ISN'T"" free !! I pay $5.99 to watch it on my TV, this ""USE"" to include being able to watch it on my Cell Phone. NOT ANYMORE !! NOW they want to CHARGE you $49.99 for One Year 😒. This is just to watch on your CELL !! P.S. I still watch it on my TV (for now)..."
awesome quality and reliability 5 stars all the way
I am extremely surprised at all the good movies and series available to watch. Seriously thinking about canceling my Netflix account. WAY TO GO EPIX NOWI!!!! 👍👍👍👍👍
I like the way it's set up it's a smooth app. Wish I could skip recap but that's my only gripe. I like the format better than other streaming apps
"I like the idea of it, but just didn't use it. I have Netflix, so it was somewhat redundant. I have a feeling that it possibly had some programs that Netflix doesn't carry that I would have enjoyed, however, I didn't have time to check it out. Might try another time in the future."
pretty easy navigating through the app. all the features are working and the selection of content is a decent collection
This review for those who got free Dominos trial. You are not subscribed to any service. You didn't give out your credit card number. You don't need to cancel anything because you didn't subscribe to anything. So stop whining and enjoy free stuff while it lasts
Had no problems. Pretty good selection. Used domino's promo to get free 30 day subscription. When I emailed to cancel I was met with quick response. Loved the customer service from Selena
Excellent selection to choose from could use a larger variety but for the price who am I to complain and the picture quality is spot on.
Great App to have excellent movie choices my favorite thus far is bumpy Johnson The best casting this was truly the reason why I chose epic and as long as they bring movies like this I will keep epic and the other movies are good quality works with the phone iPad And is really affordable you can afford epic I highly recommend epic this truly is a good streaming service I wish they had more movies though but I guess the add to their movie collection so but as a right now this is a good stream
"Starts on time, you can adjust the volume on phone if volume on tv isn't loud enough, picture is great."
"Great app for entertainment. It has great original content along with the movies I love. Much cheaper than Showtime or HBO, and the quality is awesome!"
I followed the directions to the T and the epix app doesn't show up in my subscriptions. I got the trial from dominos. Epix doesn't even have anything worth watching to even have a free trial. And i dont want my account charged. I emailed them and still gave got no response back. Who do I go thru to get this handled. Can you help a guy out Epix??
a ton of really good movies and TV series. especially if you like horror I just started Chapelwaite and it's getting good! plus it's only like 6 or 7 dollars a month.
I love the tv screening feature and the quality of the movies are awesome. I look forward to watching more movies on this app in the future.
epix the best have it through my roku and love the movies and the price is perfect perfect app never change i love this 100% i would give 100stars if had this app well worth it and i like you have classic movies to as well as the live tv cant ask for anything better
"Enjoy the variety of movies, clarity and sound with no system interruptions. I can relax when I have EpixNow on."
This is a good app. It linked to my LG tv perfectly. It offers a variety of movies and shows plus LiveTv choices. Try it I think you will like it.
"I truly love this app, as well as the channel on my television at home. Can't get enough of all of the absolute wonderful selection of movies."
The movies I look at are very entertaining and great. Movies in the past on this app. I love very much and it provides me the kind I find very interesting. Thank you
"** ""Phenomenal acting, vibrant plots, emotional wisdom & the best series ever. This is must see viewing for those truly intriqued by a well written & superbly acted series, portraying historical facts about Harlem & Mr. Bumpy Johnson. I always enthusiastically look forward to seeing this show. It captures the period, the people & the history of Harlem in vivid detail. The producer, director, actors, fine actresses & sets are the best. This show is better than a bespoke suit !!"" ** EPIX WINS"
"Have only watched one movie, so far so good. The starting and stopping gets on my nerves, but that could be my problem. Anyways, I think I'll subscribe... maybe"
"the most underrated premium movie service, also the original tv series is what hooked me, please keep making more original series like get shorty, pennyworth, and godfather of Harlem, you cannot beat the price for the content epix has."
"wonderful moves and TV shows wonderful originals just over all this app is the "" Shisnit "" I've gotten so bored of Netflix and Hulu and pornhub that I needed something new to watch in my life lol but all jokes aside I really do enjoy this app and I see absolutely no reason for them to not get a 5 Star rating!!!"
"The best no issues no buffering awesome playback, clarity .....etc I had to get the app for ""The God Father of Harlem!!!"" Was worth every hour of sleep i missed binge watching this series.."

great app and work excellent and no slow loading and is a very fast on loading movie and watch live tv and the speed the app have I rated 5 stars for the review of this app
"I Love this app❣️❣️ Movies are great, no problems with having to stop and start over!! Great selection 👍😊"
"great selection ( action, drama,comedy) fair pricing. only negitve comment, no phone for problems or questions."
From season 2 <3 only reason I'm here
"Experience was great, due to pandemic I can't afford the app though, so I would like to unsubscribe please and thank you."
"Excellent listening experience. I am able to create may playlists, on YouTube or here and the two communicate with each other. The predictive playlists are also great if you're not really interested in creating something, or want to discover something new that you might like. I do have premium, and I also highly recommend that, especially the family plan as the unlimited listening access (and watch) is perfect for multiple users."
I love the music app. only thing that would make me love it any more is if it was completely free AND you could still back out of the app and into another without the music stopping. I'm still in my free trial phase but I doubt I will be paying for that when the trial ends. Oh one more thing...I wish I could save songs to more than one playlist without having to do them each separately. Other than that it's fantastic!
"The app is stable, not a battery drainer, and I like the many different improvements they've implemented since I started using it years ago. The algorithm has greatly improved as has the variety of playlists and ways to dig around and explore, to find new and similar songs/artists. I also rarely hear the same song twice on the same playlist. I can't comment on ads as I'm a subscriber, but the music selection is great and you can even access YouTube's video selection."
"No complaints here. I've used many subscription-based music apps and found YT Music to be the best. Huge catalog of music and I like that a lot of videos from YouTube can be listened to through it. I can't vouch for the free version, though, as I haven't been a free-user for a couple of years. Android pairs well with it which was a nice surprise switching from an iPhone to the S20. Recommendations/Radios have also improved a lot through the years. Definitely stacks up against the competition"
"I've been using this app since it first came out, and it's really expanded my taste in music. I've discovered my all-time favorite music from this app. Although, the genre often gets off-track when you play a quick-pick and leave it on autoplay. But sometimes that's also really funny. Sometimes it'll play a really depressing song, and immediately next a really intense, upbeat song. I like to send these occurences to my friends, it always brings a laugh. Well, as long as they know the songs 🎵"
"Been with YouTube Music since it was released. Love the offline download option for when data isn't available. It keeps track of music I listen to the most. Even if I hear something I don't like, it always mixes in stuff I enjoy. And if not... Thumbs down it and it will not play that song again. Wish we could have podcast (edit, they added podcasts!) Overall I like this over spotify."
Absolutely outstanding seamless recommendations. I love the algorithm. I like the fact that I can pay $9.99 a month and it's cheaper on Google phones or Android rather than it is on the iPhone. Thank you Google. But my playlist are downloaded. I can listen to it offline seamless. It's amazing! Absolutely wonderful! I'm glad that I purchased the premium version. Keep up the good work. You got a customer for life
"No ads, immediately off to a good start. The app makes playlists that I may like based on my favorites, and it does very well at this. While at work, I am constantly turning my vehicle on and off when visiting different job sites. Youtube music automatically links back up and starts playing where I left off each time. That's also a great feature. My family of 5 has been using this app for months now, and we all love it."
I pay $10 a month for the music subscription. I've been paying for the subscription even when it was called Google play music. I definitely don't mind because the one I don't like ads and two I can listen to music with the screen off. I can download songs and listen to it offline. So I definitely think it's worth it. Also use it on my Chromebook. This app has definitely improved over the years. Best Music App EVER!
Music app will not play in the background. Even if you pay for a subscription it will not play. Please bring back goolge play music. It was so much better. I haven't tried to use this with android auto. I hope that works or I will look for another service since I use the music apps mostly in my car. Music app is horrible in station mode. I wanted dance music and it plays c**p. UPDATE. Works great now with android auto. Thanks for fixing it.
"I started out really not liking the switch from Google Play Music to YT Music....but, I'm happy to say that I've revised my opinion. They are doing a good job with the stability of the app, and I especially like the new feature to create your own station, based upon choosing some artists you enjoy listening to. I went from hardly using YT Music, to using it as my regular music app, especially for my workouts. I enjoy the premium features, as I have YT Premium."
"Definitely the best music streaming service. Easiest to use, has the best recommendation algorithm, and they straight up have an enormous music selection that iTunes and Spotify could only dream of. All of the other services only open their doors to already known music. YouTube Music truly is the home for all the independent and upcoming artists out there."
"I don't have a lot issues that others seem to have with is great for me since I work from home and listen to music alot. I do wish however that I could sort the ""Likes"" playlist into ABC order by song title instead of order the songs were added or just shuffle. I like neatness and order. Another complaint I see, and agree with is only being able to remove songs from the whole album. But for the most part I'm happy. Sound and quality is great. Selection of music is great."
"At first, YouTube music can be difficult to navigate. It's not as intuitive as I would like to see, though it is getting better. The major benefit to YouTube music is that it literally has EVERYTHING. There are tracks from video games, TV shows, movies, and obscure recordings from one-hit wonders. If you want to hear it, you'll find it here, and generally nowhere else. Even Amazon and Spotify cannot say the same. I've had at least ten other music apps, but YouTube music tops them all."
"It's all I use now for anything ""music"" anytime, anywhere that I go. I have several music ""mixes,"" each one unique to a particular type of musical vibe, so there is basically a mix that fits any mood that I could possibly be in... Often, I'll just be in the mood to hear a particular song, but then the playlist that follows, generated from that song choice, well it ends up being a bunch of songs that happen to fit my mood perfectly. Regardless, there's always something I like playing on now!"
"The app is amazing in every way possible. good reccomendations, good quality, etc. The only thing abt it that I wish would be fixed is that you can't pick a custom photo for your playlists. I really wish that was an available feature (that alone is the only reason why Spotify is a better music app.)"
"I am rating this app from the point of view of availability of music. Because, it appears that the people who did the last or so update are not happy with the results. I am running version 5.47.51, so I will try to stay away from the update until not longer possible. It is the best for streaming music. Just to give you a solid reason, I used to have Spotify and Apple Music and none of them have the wide range of songs and/or genre that you can only find in YouTube music for streaming."
"It's my default music service after Google Play Music was dropped, but it fulfills its purpose well. It is annoying that there is only a subscription service, meaning that I will constantly have to shell out $10 a month instead of a one-time purchase of a song that I can listen to on repeat. One amazing thing I can admit to is that the list of music I can listen to has vastly increased due to the inclusion of foreign artists as well as songs that are only available as YouTube videos!"
"As a premium user, this app has pretty much anything I could ask for! The music recommendations are tuned very well and the interface is easy to use. My only suggestion would be to have a feature that allows the changing of playlist covers, similar to Spotify, so that there's a little more personalization. Edit: The new feature that lets you tune your own radio is also awesome, although it would be nice if you could search for artists using a search bar instead of scrolling infinitely."
"When Google Play Music first moved to YouTube Music, the downgrade in quality (in terms of interface, music availability, auto-playlist quality, etc.) was dismaying. But YTM has gradually improved over time to the point that I have no major complaints about it now. The auto playlists (aka ""radio"") are still hit-or-miss, often reverting to the same ten songs and only playing the same songs by particular artists rather than mixing things up. But, dollar for dollar, it's a good streaming option."
"I've been using YouTube Music since the beginning. It's a Great App and Service that offers a large variety of Music as well as Music videos (when available). The lyrics options (again, when available) is a good way to learn the words to a newly discovered or favorite song. The only thing I think could make it even better is if it offered a karaoke option where the lyrics highlight when the song plays. Also being able to create your own music playlist (or digital mix tape) is pretty Awesome."
"Love this app! Hooked on it, car, house, pretty much wherever I go. Hook up to a speaker with Bluetooth and I'm in a great mood in seconds. My husband and I sit outside for hours, even when it got cold. Nice fire in the winter, listening to songs we hadn't heard in years. Becoming fans of music genre's we never dreamed we'd like. I search for it they have it. Your Playlist ends, app plays artists/music based on what you've listened to. Have a subscription so no ads. Very straightforward to use."
I like this app a lot. I use a widget on my desktop most of the time to access it. I enjoy how it appears in my taskbar when it's playing (I can't remember the right word for taskbar on Android). I really haven't been impressed with the autoplay/radio but that may not count as feedback for the app. Love that you can view lyrics and videos.
"Great work done on this app by far the best music app I have had the experience of having the capability of being able to listen to new music, download for offline listening. Great for video.and audio. I would like to be able to adjust the audio equalization for better listening on different devices. No ads with the premium account is the best. I hope it the premium account is discontinued then when listening to the music that has been downloaded won't have ads like some apps I have tried before"
"The music selection has gotten better over the last couple years. There seems to be some more intelligence behind playlist formation, though some picks still leave you scratching your head. The audio quality is pretty good if you turn on that feature. It never complains about listening on too many devices at once, however I pay for the family plan so that shouldn't be an issue. And last but not least the app itself is very stable on my pixel 6."
"Haven't been a streaming music consumer for years because bad user experiences early on. Streaming performance while connected to wifi is flawless. Most impressive is I opened the app, searched and played one of my favorite songs and it played an hour of music and I only needed to skip one song. I have a weird eclectic taste in music so this was completely unexpected."
I did not get this app for a long time. I thought I could listen to my favorite music by simply going to my playlist on YouTube. I was sooo mistaken. The ability to play my music offline and to listen to the songs while reading a book on my phone is well worth the little 9.99 a month. I can listen to anything I've downloaded including podcasts. Great app!
"Great app, I can listen to music without a care, and the fact that some music comes from YouTube gives even more stuff to see! Basically Spotify but better. Edit: I've heard people are having trouble with the app crashing, and I want to say I have never actually came across that on my phone or PC. Sometimes it lags if I launch a game like Minecraft java on my PC or a generally laggy game on my phone it stops for a while and lags but other than that I'm fine."
"This is hands down my favorite music platform to use. 1. You can find just about any song so there's no limits. 2. You don't need premium to select random songs, so you don't have to listen to some random playlist. 3. The recommendation list for each song that's playing is accurate and might even put you on to some songs you've never heard. 4. Premium is disappointing because it's only for YouTube music. You won't get ads for music but you will for videos on the same account :( 5.Still #1 tho"
"Switched from Pandora, years ago. I like the new music and being able to find videos of songs too. The mixes are pretty repetitive and I would prefer to create mixes with similar artists, but overall I am very satisfied with the app. I can't even recall ever experiencing technical difficulties either. That's a plus!"
"LOVE IT! Bought the premium, and I use it every day for streaming music and for music while I work. The clean dark mode interface is very easy and intuitive for quick playback, and the app is lightweight and responsive! Would love to see an official desktop app soon for PCs Macs and Linux users. In the meantime, the browser version does the job fine."
"I've tried every music service you can think of. YouTube Music Premium is by far, the best sounding, and the easiest to navigate music streaming service out of all the others. Music is important to me. Good sounding music is just as important. Plus the way I can maneuver my playlists in such a way that I can hear certain tunes in any order I prefer,is invaluable. You Tube Music Premium will always be a part of my life."
"Great app. Access to all my favorites, and makes suggestions to help me discover new faves. A few tweaks would be good, one being able to advance thru songs without them immediately playing. As well, it has a ""recently played"" function, but it doesn't list specific songs in order, making it hard to find a song again that you liked."
"This has to be the best music app ever. It always plays the right songs at the right time. It knows what I like and I love it. YT music keeps up with what you listen to the most and sends you a ""top 5 songs of 2022"" list (as an example...) I would highly recommend YouTube music app to anyone. It's by far my favorite app on my Android"
"This is honestly one of the best apps I've ever used. And I don't just mean music apps. I'm literally blown away. I used to be a Spotify fanboy, but after YouTube Music, I'm never going back. The Radio feature is the pinnacle of human innovation. The UI is incredibly slick, organic, clean and intuitive. Millennia ago, Gautam Buddha said that existence in this world is inherently inseparable from suffering. I believe that he wouldn't have thought so if he'd ever had access to YouTube Music."
"I've got thousands of songs saved to play lists to suit every mood. The design of the app is brilliant in that it combines the best of Pandora and Apple. I love being able to share Playlists with family and friends. When not listening to my own library, I discover new music thru the stations and other people's Playlist. I'm hooked forever!!!"
This is better than iTunes better than Spotify better than all of them. The other ones only have access to albums this has everything everything you can find on YouTube you can download things and the way that this app updates my mixes like every 2 seconds seems like almost lol Is Awesome! It gives you new music each week in Discovery stuff and it's just the best flipping get it and I would recommend getting the premium for all the music you'll ever need in your entire life:-)
"Works perfectly everytime. By far superior to Spotify and Amazon. The features are perfectly ideal for me and everything I do. In the car, on the ear buds, streaming videos, your play list is always perfect and can be adjusted very fast for the situation needed. Don't hesitate if you like music and want to be the first to hear the newest. This is the only option for me. ENJOY!!!"
I love that I can find any song I want to hear on YouTube. If there is anything I might change it would be that sometimes I have difficulty organizing music they I save properly. And in all fairness I know that it is my own inexperience with technology that is the problem. I need instructions for tech dummies to use the app properly.
It's a lot better than the other music apps I've used in the past. Still there are a few songs and mixtapes I wish it could search and find. I guess you can't find all music with this app. Still I think it's better than the other apps I've used. With the premium version there really aren't any ads! Overall the best music app I've used so far even though you can't find all music with it. I especially like the feature that you can like a video and save it onto a playlist without downloading.
A majority of the music I listen to is Southern made and not found on the radio or main stream media. You tube music literally has it all and more. On top of that the mix of personalized music seems to be more random and intuitive that any other music app. The only music app I'll ever need. A big pat on the back to the developers of this App. The only thing I would change is that over time the app forgets you favorites or makes then unavailable. Other than that the app is perfect.
"I personally thinks it great! Custom playlist it makes, the liked songs playlist, to the recommendations it can give is all good. If you really want a youtube app for just music it's not gonna fail you. You will get ads though and sometimes it's anoyying. But- I don't find they ruin the experience. So long as you're ready to skip it or spare 20-30 seconds. All in all, it's great, and I look forward to more improvements. Cause ofc nothing is perfect"
"I've never tried any other music apps, so I'm not comparing here. I mean, when you're really happy with something, ""Why fix it if it ain't broke""? I have very eclectic taste in music and from day 1, they not only caught on to what I like, but introduced me to music that I was absolutely in love with and would never have found otherwise. Love the updated quarterly playlists because I listen to so much that even though it's in my library, I can't keep track of it all & I like being reminded. 😊"
"This is the best music app I've ever had! I've use Deezer, Spotify and Amazon Music apps but this is the best app of them all! One note to anyone reading this review when you play your playlist for some reason it opens up the music from within the app instead of from within your playlist. Just backspace once or twice and you'll be back to YOUR playlist! Happy music listening or video watching!"
I happen to really like the YouTube music app. The only thing I don't like about it is if you don't purchas it I can't get the app to play over other apps on this particular phone and the commercials almost all the time are really out of sync with whatever music I'm listening to or just in general to what is most reluctantly important and it can really get you out if the groove during your listening experience to get interrupted by a commercial that is intentional trying to purswade you away
"YouTube music is completely pay to win. Example: you have to pay a monthly fee to be able to 1) play your songs as an alarm clock in the android alarm app, and 2) be able to exit the app and/or turn off your phone and have your music keep playing. I just downloaded Pandora and I found that you can have both of those things listed above, for free! I used to be a huge supporter of YouTube music for a long time, but I've found something better. JUST DOWNLOAD PANDORA!!!"
"Simple and easy. Plays all my music and if I'm feeling adventurous I can select a channel I do not subscribed to and it could be my next favorite song or genre. The only draw back is the ability to keep your shuffled music the way you like, but if you add a new track you have to go to the folder add it as a new song and then you go back to you shuffled songs only to find them lined up by alphabet not how you left it. Other then that everything else works great."
"The app plays so many songs based on one song I choose and created an entire playlist of my NOW favorite songs. Its helped me discover artists I never heard of. Great app! I had one issue on my paid subscription: the music would stop a few time every hour. VERY annoying. Found the fix in YouTube videos: my settings blocked ads. Reset to ""Allow all ads"" which hasn't affected my paid subscription. Life is great again! Please add feature to allow a permanent changing of song position."
"I have used different music apps for the past 5+/- years and so far the YouTube Music app beats all competitors apps. I listen to different genres and I have been 99.9% successfull in locating a particular song, band, artist, etc. The best part is when I am driving in a dead zone, I can still listen to my favorite music."
"Google Play music worked perfectly. It was my preferred way to listen to music, and my default for Google Home. Then you design this garbage and force it down my throat. I've liked Google products for years, but with nearly every recent change you've made, it just gets worse and worse. It's also annoying that half the YouTube videos I try to cast with my Google Home devices end up with your assistant playing it from YouTube Music instead."
"Best streaming music app. Period. Never looked for one thing under the sun that I haven't found. And my music tastes do not always run to the readily available 😁. Not to mention, the price, for what you get, insanely cheap!! All 6 of us have every single benefit of premium across both apps, and it's less than 20 bucks per month?! Crazy! Someone needs to alert Spotify!! In all seriousness, I use this app more than very nearly any other, on the daily, and so does the rest of the fam. Go Google!"
"We have the family plan and while it is a bit expensive, it's worth a few extra bucks a month. Ad free, I can always find any song or artist I've ever searched including some hard to find remixes. It's also got some good features like the different options for playlists, lyrics, queue, and more. It's the only music app our family uses mostly. I'd recommend."
"Best music app by far. It's algorithm works exceedingly well to find what you like! As you use YouTube Music it learns your preferences then it compiles custom playlists for you based on mood, music genres, anything. Fabulous! When you call out any song or even background sounds such as rainforest, river, ocean, etc. the app follows up with more of what you selected to start. Another great feature is that it draws from your regular YouTube favorites to YouTube Music. Great job team Google! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
I love the this app. I have been using it for years. I love the playlist that they make up for me. The recommendation are as always on points and such an easy app to use. I pay the premium to have no commercials/ads and love that I can save my songs & playlist so even if I don't have a internet I can still listen to my music. It's kids friendly a well.
"YouTube Music is an amazing music streaming service that has completely transformed my music listening experience. With a vast library of songs from all genres and eras, I can easily find my favorite songs and discover new ones. The personalized playlists and recommendations are spot on and always keep me entertained. Plus, the ability to watch music video"
"Algorithm hasn't led me astray yet. Oh sometimes you have to restart your bluetooth connection if you happen to walk away from your router causing you to have a weaker wifi connection. It'll just start-stop constantly even if you attempt to walk back closer. It's cringe till you switch to mobile data. Other than that, fantastic for what it does."
"Idk how many times I've updated my reviews but I've gone from giving this app 3 stars to finally giving it 5. This app has everything you need to enjoy and discover new music. The end of year recap was EXCELLENT and on par with other major apps. Now you can create your own song radio which I'm excited for. The only thing I'd like to see is the ability to ""follow"" or ppl like friends or to be able to see how many ppl save your public playlists to their library."
"So, I very rarely rate apps. But YouTube Music Premium has been the best music listening app I've ever used. I have paid for Pandora, Spotify, and SoundCloud. But this has simply the largest selection of music. They also have some of best song recommendations I've ever had. My music taste changes almost quarterly because of YouTube Music."
"Finally! The set up alot of us have been waiting for! Go to library, select the artist, then the albums are separated, each one plays its entirety before going to the next album. To make it even better...the albums are listed in order of release! Just hope they dont get rid of any music....great selections! UPDATE: still like the app, but can you add a way to sort in reverse release date order? Sometimes people like to start from a groups first cd."
Great music app for anyone who doesn't have a specific library of songs to download but wants to still have music you listen too offline. Totally worth the Premium because without it there are way too many ads which seem to be getting longer and more frequent. Still my go-to app for listening to music.
"You can find any kind of music here and save it or download it. My playlist is very eclectic from the 60's when I was in my teens and nearly a half century of my old favorites to some I just heard the first time tonight. I've spent a night full of music magic and happier than I've been this year and for awhile forgot the reality of finding a water heater, the electric bill bill it ran up needing to go to the store and mostly the fact that I just turned 69 and a recent widow. It's definitely grea"
"Man i am NOT gonna be able to cancel this app at the end of the trial !!! Da**it! I'm ruined for regular YouTube now! It took all of 2 days. No commercials, I'm able to access and launch it seamlessly via my phone's Bluetooth stereo connection, which isn't cutting edge tech by any standard. Now i have to budget it in.... fortunately it's not too terribly expensive. YET! I recommend giving in and splurging on it asap before the rate goes up. It's worth it!!!! 5 stars is not enough!"
Ever since I discovered this app it is the only app I use for my music. I love the options for saving and creating playlists you can even download and listen offline. Streaming and downloading legally and I can listen to my playlist without Internet! This is the best music app by far imo. This is literally the only review I have ever written! That says something for sure. If you love music like I do you want this app it's definitely worth the 10$ a month
"Love the App, although it is pricey p/mo. Prior to paying monthly, I got a 3 month free trial period. I was sold on commercial free since I watch a lot of YouTube videos and got tired of all the advertisements or interruptions. I was hooked after a couple of weeks exploring the music options. YouTube music has lots of choices and variety. So, bottom line: commercial free videos & music together make the price worth it in the end. **Bonus: works well with my home Google audio devices."
"I switched from Pandora to YouTube Music, and I must say... I'm impressed. Pandora would constantly play old(er) tracks even when I would search for like ""Lil Wayne's New Music 2023"". I would heart A Milli 🤦🏾‍♀️YouTube Music is awesome! I create a playlist, and the app creates them for me also! I have the no ads version, so I'm not bothered by several minutes of boring ads while I'm working out."
"This app is great, it has all the songs unlike Spotify, and doesn't have ""premium"" songs like Amazon. Only things I would like to see are the ability to add variety to a playlist after you start a radio, and to also be able to sort my liked songs playlist into the different genres. Other than that 5 out of 5."
"Better than the rest. YouTube music is my preferred platform for music entertainment. I recommend it to anybody that doesn't have it. Good organization and layout of playlists, and accurate song suggestions. They changed how I view my playlist library and I don't like that.. but still five stars."
"Been a user since the start. I enjoy what it's become, but the ONE complaint I have if I had anything to say would be to fix the shuffle function! I don't want to listen to the top 10 songs each time I hit shuffle. MIX IT UPPPPP. But otherwise, I love you YouTube music ♡ oh and maybe include translation lyrics for different language songs? That would be cool."
"Best!I absolutely love YouTube Music! With access to almost unlimited songs, it has become my go-to source for music. The app is easy to use and I particularly appreciate the personalized recommendations it provides. My only wish is for a better social format that would make it easier to share my music play account with others. Overall, I highly recommend YouTube Music to anyone who wants to enjoy great music anytime, anywhere!"
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH. I love music and YouTube Music is perfect for me. My family all has premium and it's just amazing. My family is trying to save money but if they are paying for this I know that means it's not so bad. It glitches sometimes but not really. This is 9.5 out of 10 for me. I really enjoy listening to music while I draw. Just absolutely love it.
"Love this app! All my favorite music is found here, and if I hear a song from tiktok or somewhere else, I can find it here and add it to my collection! My ONLY complaint is that my music will sometimes stop randomly while playing. This does get kind of annoying and I wish there was some way to fix it."
"Great, love it any song you can think of is on here. But what would be really cool. Is if they added a timmer to cut the music off so when I'm trying to sleep I can listen to music to fall asleep and it'll cut off at whatever time I set it to. Like: play music for 1 hour and it plays through the Playlist and cuts off at the hour."
Like the fact that I can find any type of music! And now with some of the lyrics I can correct myself! Update: Been using for about 3 years now and can honeslty say it's a great app. I like all types of music and I can find them here. If I don't have service or I'm on a plane the songs that get downloaded make it easy to hear.
"Hands down best $ I've spent on a app. I listen to music all hours thru out the day so the ads absolutely drove me nuts so I gave the 3 month free trial a go and after 3 months I began paying for. Trust me, it's well worth the $12 a month. You can download music too too listen to offline plus when you turn your screen off the music continues to play. Best app I have and the ONLY app besides Google One that I actually pay for. Highly recommend!"
Of the subscription streaming services I have used YouTube Music seems to come through my devices (speakers/headphones/car stereo) the loudest and the cleanest. I've cancelled all the others. Also the mixes (based off a song) are the best for my taste. I learn about new to me artists and enjoy standbys at the same time. I recommend it highly to everyone who will listen. 🤣
"If you're driving, then this app is great. Who wants to hear a Google commercial when you're catching a vibe? It also lets you hear music from the artist you like that you've never heard. It also keeps a nice playlist. Ten bucks a month can't beat that. Ever since I started listening to this app,I can't take hearing advertisement interruptions. 10 outta 10 in my books. 👍🏾🤓"
"Love it. Great sound quality. Keep going GOOGLE. I have yet to see one song missing from this platform. Other platforms, yep, even missing known Artist. I've been riding the wave since Play Music. The Video option is incredible. Sometimes a song or two might disappear and that's most likely over licensing but rest assured it's still somewhere on the platform Masked."
YouTube music is my one and only true love when it comes to a media player and streaming platform for music and audio. The only negative aspect is how many ads the free version has. But as long as you dont mind dropping the $10 a month for Premium then you couldn't ask for a better app!
"I've tried many music platforms and this one is far superior for me. Reason no. 1 is the access to all genres of metal music. Even obscure, unsigned or signed bands Reason no. 2 is truly uninterrupted music play Reason no. 3 is how they do their play stations Reason no. 4 is the amount of downloads they allow you to have. This is great when you don't have cell service. I have a massive play list. Love youtube music. ❤️"
"I really enjoy using this app almost on a daily basis. However, the one thing that bothers me the most how the music will simply just stop. Unlock my phone and the app is closed and the song shows an error. Seems to come and go even when I update the app often."
"Found memorable songs and music that would have been impossible looking for them elsewhere. The interface is easy to navigate with the app providing similar music selections based on your playing history as well as music, artist or searches. Provides convenience if downloading either the video if available as well as the lyrics to songs. You tube music did it's homework very well. Music selections can be downloaded to play even when disconnected from the internet. Yes definitely better"
"It could be as good as Spotify or even better in one way or another, in both positive and negative. But I have overall enjoyed the development in the past 2 years and have noticed at least for myself a lot of changes from what I was accustomed to. Overall it's easy to find the music you can't usually find or add to your playlist or likes. But the way Spotify and YouTube music handle it are different for likes unfortunately. That's why I made the switch"
"Really like this app. My SuperMix gets dialed in and almost always is a great generated mix of bangers. No issues casting to speakers or TV. I wish there was an ""incognito"" mode so if someone else wants to hear something,or I need to listen to instrumental music for studying. I don't want that in my history, influencing my recommendations. Sure I suppose I could create different profiles but it's not always easy to change profiles. Otherwise, great app!"
"I just love the layout. Easy to use, easy to find songs, find something new and the option to switch between music and the music video is just so amazing. The download feature, easy and simple. Always have music with or without internet. I've had YouTube premium for years now and the fact you get ad free YouTube with this app and feature is just unbelievable. I don't know how people choose the other options. #notsponsored, I would to be though"
"It is very pleasing to me, 100% , I must think of an exception where when you do not pay your subscription on time, you will have limited access, for example not able to play none of the downloaded music added to your playlists, but I got it, because that is just normal, and it happened with any other apps, that if you do not pay your subscription on time you will have limited access, so for me there is no exception, it is perfect and am 💯💪 satisfied ❣️"
"I love this app. for the price it's better because you also dont get ads and more. you can listen to it on multiple different devices at the same time, you can look up the lyrics easily, and watch the music videos for them. you get recommended songs for each song instead of a playlist and the songs sound better. for example, all of exo's songs sound better and once I played two songs at the exact same time (cherry bomb by nct127) and it was 10 times better. serously get this app it's amazing!"
"An excellent music service. The presentation contains an enormous amount of information and features, much of which I find useful and of interest. HOWEVER, just swapped to Pixel 6A with Android 13 on board and it's painful in the car! The app continuously crashes and the phone stops working until disconnected and reconnected, after which It works for a few minutes, then crashes again!! AVOID, unusable, such a pity!! Back to Spotify!? UPDATE-MAY 5TH 2023… problem over, nearly!"
"Its extremely easy to manage and very friendly, and its even better with premium because its not that expensive and gives an even better experience. But one thing i noticed, is if i started a playlist and wanted to check a song from it after i switched playlist, i cant find the song in history, only the song that started the playlist is listed in history. Ither than that, its a good app."
"This app has a very good algoritm. It knows what kind of songs suited my taste depends on what songs i currently listen to. I rarely hits the skip/next button when streaming music with this app. Those many playlists that it mixes for me, and those song suggestions they want me to discover, they're perfect! Keep it up! The radio feature needs improvement though. I chose artists with ballad songs but it gave me other artists with totally different genre."
Best music app out there. The selection is amazing because there is music from all over the world!! I love YouTube! The only flaw I see is your forced to make playlists because nothing is downloaded in order per letter. If you can handle that fact and make your own playlists its amazing I have over 30 all different playlists of music Deffently recommend. Just make sure to private your account or your coworkers might to try and use what you like to listen to against you .
Honestly my favorite app! I'm always on the hunt for new music and YouTube Music caters to my interests as well as suggesting new music related to my search for classic tunes. The offline downloads mean I can listen to music whenever and wherever I like. I don't know how I managed to make playlists before it. 😍
"I love YT music a lot! A bunch of my favorite songs and artists are available here. Which I couldn't find in other music streaming apps. Honestly, I don't mind the ads in the free version. As long as it won't pester and overwhelm me. As I don't wanna be pressured with a monthly obligation using the premium.."
"I was having terrible trouble with this app, constantly stopping randomly in the middle of songs. I ended up uninstalling & reinstalling it and it has completely solved the problem. All my history/playlists etc were still intact, and the mini player widget has returned to my lock screen. I am much happier now! I love the continuous music feature too, once I reach the end of a playlist, songs from same/similar artists and genres just automatically play, very useful for finding new (or old!) stuff"
"Just updated-the app is much improved and reliable. 2021:Patchy performance. Its one of the apps I use most, but its also the one that causes memost grief. Quite often, whilst using it via Android auto, it will play through the track with no sound output. I then have to go to a more reliable app like Audible or Spotify to start playing and the flip back to YT to listen to music. All of this being quite distracting while driving. I have the same issue on my phone after the latest Android update."
"The best, but could be better. For instance, it failed generating my winter playlist and there's no way to regenerate it. I can't see if a track has thumbs up on mobile unless I tap on it. When I add something to queue it gets appended to the very end of an autoplay list, when the intention was second to next. Lots of scrolling to find a song in my library, when Idon't know its name. I would like to hear more often less player songs from my Liked list, especially if it was added a while ago"
"I really like YouTube Music but for some reason, it stopped working suddenly. I can enter the app but it shows nothing for some reason when I've been this app for a long time. There's no songs in home, Discover, and library for some reason. I can only listen to songs when I type the specific name of the song in the search. Can you please fix this bug. * They fixed the bug"
"Pretty useless app. I transferred my PURCHASED WITH REAL MONEY albums to this app as requested but only one has shown. I want all the rest of my PURCHASES or refund the price of the missing albums please. I thought this app was intended for playing my own albums but now it's all over the place. EDIT: Wow can't belieive I wrote that then! This app has come a long way over the years, it has become very intuitive and more enjoyable. I have discovered so much more music. It kept all my albums too."
"The perfect relationship with a Google Pixel Phone for Music! There's something special about what YTMusic has to offer. The way they have implemented their algorithms to find you music to match your tastes is on another level! My only gripe is the inability to have multitudes of music downloaded for offline use. I believe there is a cap of ~2gbs of music for this (which isn't much). Maybe they will address this further down the road. All in all, very happy with this app otherwise!"
I've been using this app since day one of its release and it's truly improved over the years. From a barely functioning music app that crashes all the time and had bad audio quality to a music app with amazing autoplay and good enough quality for my liking. The recent addition of setting up your own playlist style by parameters is also truly an incredible feature.
"personally, i love this app and use it everyday! worth every penny to subscribe to it, but even as a free app it has alot to offer. however, one thing i hate is when i 'Like' a song and the '[Song] has been added to likes' pop-up appears for far longer than i think it needs to? not sure if it's the same kind of pop-up message for adding songs to playlists, but it matters to me because once i 'Like' a song, i want to read the lyrics but it's often blocked by that message... that's p much all!"
