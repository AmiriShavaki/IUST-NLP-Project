"O: There is a loud, obnoxious ad after nearly each round. Also, opting to watch an ad to revive Alto will close the game, causing it to restart the round instead of picking up where he landed. It is very irritating. I downloaded the app yesterday. I have only played a couple times, and it seems like fun. The effects of the ads are annoying, though. UD: Paid to remove ads. Now it glitches, moving the character in a way that causes crashes. Glitches also shake the scene causing round loss."
"I loved this game so much I spent $2.99 to remove ads! On a mobile game of all things I thought it impossible, but this game was good...when I could actually play it. Now it just freezes up on me. And yes there's nothing wrong with my phone it simply started ""freezing up"". Devs, you made a game I saw myself playing when I'm bored or in need of relaxation. Please, start this year off by helping fix this ""freezing problem"" even if it doesn't mean much to those who don't have the problem. Thanks."
"Next to impossible to play. A major aspect of the game is jumping, but the jumping is slow (and unupgradeable) and good jumping spots are never seen. Plus, barriers blend into the background making them difficult to see, especially at high speeds. Thoroughly frustrating and unpleasant, especially for what could have been a good rip-off of Journey."
"Cheap deaths always make the player feel annoyed. This game has a lot of issues when crossing chasms. The randomness of the level design doesn't care to provide speeding tools to cross large chasms. This way, players can die without having the possibility to avoid it. Also, adds should give rewards for the player, not only appear every time he dies, as punishment."
"Goals Don't work. I'm stuck at the ""Maya 10 back flips in one run"" goal. I've done it 5 or 6 times with no continue. I've made sure to land 15-20 backflips with no revives, not in water, etc. It NEVER registers completion. Furthermore there is NO SUPPORT IN GAME!! The basics of the app are Fabulous, but if it doesnt work and you can't progress, what's the point? If this issue is fixed, I'd give the app 5 stars. But frustrated as I am, it gets 1 star today."
"Okay so I'm actually really kind of annoyed because this used to be one of my go-to games to just waste a little time. However, now I got the objective to get 350,000 points and EVERY TIME i get around 300,000 points, the game crashes. It's really frustrating me because when this happens I lose all of my coins collected (typically around 2,000). Please do something to fix this. Also it's really glitchy sometimes and in the middle of a backflip, it will glitch to make me die..? Starting to hate it"
"Alto is in all honesty a great game. Very fun, gorgeous and easy to use with plenty of challenges along the way. All of that praise is negated by the insane amount of ads. To top it off, when you're finally given the privilege the dismiss the ads the 'x' is always varying in size, contrast, and position. Furthermore, the predatory practice of needing to be pixel-perfect in your dismissal of the ads often leads to you actually clicking the ad itself and launching the play store. Team Alto: be a good internet and mobile citizen and stop these predatory practices."
"Loved the first one, absolutely love this one. Fantastic improvement. However, not being able to get rid of the interrupting video ads is a complete deal breaker. I'm more than willing to either donate, or buy something in return for an ad free experience. Alas, the Devs do not let you do that. 1 star + uninstall."
"WAY too many ads. The more i play, the more ads i get. Now, every time i ""restart,"" it throws up an ad. And, if i have the advertised app installed, it opens it up, if i tap anywhere on the screen (including the ""X"" if it gives me one). i don't mind an ad here and there, like to revive during a run, but this is just obnoxious! Took a great game, otherwise, and ruined it."
"This game is very beautiful and the controls are simple. Everything about this is great, but it lags very badly which makes it unplayable for me. My jumps are delayed and my character would go through or teleport on the ground. The audio is also terrible and makes this weird static noises at random times. I would love to give this game support but these problems are unbearable."
"When initially run, it was a great time waster and was very calming and relaxed. But if you close it and reopen it... expect tons of loud and unskippable ads, a ridiculous difficulty spike, glitched/invisible obstacles (trees are suddenly considered rocks..??), etc. My suggestion to the creators: have ads for revives/continues, and have the ads play at the game's volume, not full blast and inflicting physical pain on your players."
Clearly they put more work into aesthetics than the concept. The game is fairly pretty for a cheap side scroller. However that's all that's good about it. The controls are abysmal and it completely lacks any semblance of fun. This game is a waste of time for anyone who plays it and even more so for the people who designed it.
The game and the graphics have been great. Music great. But idk if it's me but I've restarted my phone multiple times and the game still freezes on the first loading screen. I've stopped the game many times but it's been doing that all day today. Please change because i like this game. Thanks
"Ground slopes so you can barely see rocks before you hit them. Chasms are sometimes too wide for slower characters to cross. Sometimes there may be three or four ads between levels. Rocks will generate over top of plants, walls or other background items so you can't see them. Ultimately it's a subpar game with nothing unique and a frustrating amount of lengthy ads."
"Glitchy and buggy game play. I have fallen through solid objects; I have flown through chasm walls; I have had unexplainable whipe-outs. I have had the game crash on me and close multiple times, including during a record setting run. Game is fun when it works, but it is too inconsistent."
"Please revert the effect around the sun, it looks horrible but more importantly it doesnt fit in with the rest of the games artstyle :( Please revert to the original artstyle as it was intended by the original devs and how it is shown in the screenshots here."
"Game gets boring overtime and the ads are on another level of annoying. Ads aren't the problem but, the fact that I have to close an Ad 4 times before it goes away is frustrating."
"Bug report: 1.sometimes the balloon in a chasm jump doesn't spawn which leads to death 2. Sometimes the ramp before a chasm launches the player up straight in the air at 90Â° instead of projecting them forward like they should which again results in falling inside the chasm. After last update, too much frame drop. Game unplayable."
Takes too long to get back to the game. If I could just tap to retry it'd make the game actually playable
Lazy editing and graphics. impossibleto land moves and ultimate waste of time.
Ads absolute overkill. Came back to this game after about 4 years or so and absolutely nothing changed other than the fact that the game is an ad watching simulator now.
The game itself is good but controller support no longer seems to work and that was the main reason I wanted to play it
"There are now ads with an ""instant download button"" that pops up right on top of the continue button. This has downloaded things onto my phone twice without my consent. This app feels no longer safe to have on my phone"
"I finished Alto's Adventure and liked it so much so I switched to Alto's Odyssey. The game itself is great but I find it unplayable due to ads. Every time I press play/play again, a full length ad starts without a skip option. I think you guys really need to adjust the amount of ads you show or at least give us an option to skip after a couple of seconds. Otherwise I am playing like 30-45 seconds before I die, then I will be watching another 30 seconds ad so it ruins the experience."
Sorry taking back 5 because of poor character control while landing and many other locations where death is inevitable
"its a great game, but i cant differentiate the rocks i should avoid and the ones i shouldnt, and also it needs a map, its a great game but olease fix this, untill then im uninstalling"
Some features of the game are annoying like the wallride and long chasms.
Critical issue with the game no longer launching on my Samsung galaxy note 9. Please help.
"I googled and found out that its the best offline games but its not opening on my phone. Plz fix it, i really wanna try rjis game out.My phone is oppo a37"
"Weird bug ruined everything I was a big fan of Alto's Adventure. This game also didn't disappoint me but after I get past Level 25. I can't play the game anymore. I tried clearing cache. It didn't help. I reinstalled the game and it worked but when I tried to sign in with Google Play Games, it started crashing again and I can't play anymore. So all my progess (Level 25) is gone. This is very sad and frustrating. I don't wanna play from beginning again. :("
Ads are terrible and are confusing to navigate. Feels like I'm being tricked into clicking on ads for them to get payed on the back end. Would rather pay for the game
"Game used to be the most incredible zen experience pre late 2022. 10/10 would recommend to everyone. That is until they made the entire game 100 micro purchases. I had literally every character in the game from hours of playing, and it wasn't easy to progress in levels. They took everything that I had already away from me and put a price tag on it. I just want the devs to know you are all the most foul people. I used to watch ads intentionally in support. Now I hope no one downloads your game."
If I dont watch an ad to continue the run I shouldn't get an ad anyway to restart. Otherwise why would I ever stop the run? I have to watch an ad either way. You broke your own game. The penalty for continuing the run should be watching an ad. Why penalize you for stopping the run. Greed.
"This app is not nearly ready for launch. There are so many bugs it makes gameplay a nightmare. There is a noticeable lag between input and game reaction. Half the time the game freezes and won't accept any input but continues to make a buzzing noise as your avatar continues down the path into a rock. I do not recommend this game to anyone, and this game is exactly like altos adventure except for the map."
This game locks up my phone. Twice I've had to factory reset my phone. The game freezes up and makes buzzing and beeping noises before the game crashes putting my phone in a malfunctioning mode. I've made 4 purchases and I honestly regret that because you all won't refund me. I just have to deal with a broken game. Your first Alto is great... This one...not so much.
"The game itself is great game, beautiful and relaxing EXCEPT it's not when an unskippable ads come in after every fall. The unskippable ads don't show its duration but they're all at least 15-30 seconds long. Not to mention, we have to close the ads twice or thrice. For example, first we need to close the ad video (unskippable), then another 5 seconds wait for close button to appear to close the ad game demo testing and then wait for another 5 seconds to close the ad that show install button ð¤¬"
"[Update] emailed support a month ago about this issue. no response. sad, considering this is one of my favorite games. game freezes during opening sequence every time now? I tried clearing the cache but nothing's different. I don't want to uninstall/reinstall for fear of losing progress. help?"
"They've fixed the crash on open, but now every other run is interrupted by unskippable ads. When you're playing a game that uses music and sounds to enhance the experience, it's jarring to suddenly be assaulted by the screeching sound effects and bad music of an ad. Guess they didn't want people playing the game without them getting any money. I understand that it's free to play, but there are less scummy ways to turn a profit."
I had completed many levels and bought many items on Alto's Odyssey before. Now when I installed it again and signed in using the same account my previous achievements are all lost. The game starts from the beginning! It's so frustrating. I was hoping for a good game experience and I'm not happy with this How can I get my previous achievements back?
"Doesn't work. The game is supposed to be relaxing which, yeah, kinda. But every single time you crash, you have to watch an ad. It's infuriating. You can't possibly relax playing this, cause adverts keep popping up every twenty seconds. Such a shame. It would be an okay game otherwise."
"It's a fun game but some of the level challenges (backflip over a balloon from a tornado) are so situation specific that the game kinda has to do them for you. Another example is smash 5 rocks with a lotus flower in one run. This is dependent upon the game spawning lotus flowers near rocks, which it hasn't done since I received that challenge. Im also tired of collecting a radio only to have all my supplies dropped in an placed where I'm forced to jump over them. It just starts to wear on you."
"it won't even download ! it's not that I don't have internet or wifi I'm right by a hotspot and it still hasn't downloaded after 5 HOURS !!!!! don't waste ur time trying to download it . its stuck in the stage were its ""installing "" but while it's in that stage u cant delete and try again to download it . And may I say that in the first part of downloading it took 30 minutes ! it sucks"
This game has intrusive ads. Yes you can pay to remove them but it makes no sense to do so with the amount of ads that play and the $2 asking price to stop ads that when attempting to close take you to the google play store. This is all takes away from an already terrible game experience that is a reskin of the previous game with 3 new mechanics added in.
"I want to like this. Noodlecake has some great games, but this one just doesn't play right. Flips are too slow, leveling out is annoying and I can never tell when there is enough space to backflip. Whenever I do, a rock seems to shows up right at the landing area."
"A perfect game ruined by ads. It's impossible to enjoy such an amazing combination of animation, sounds and playability when every three rides a very long ad starts playing. I'm not saying you have to eliminate the ads, but don't get greedy guys! Offer rewards and make the long ones a choice. Moreover, most of these ads are very poorly made, so much they ruin the whole experience."
"PLEASE - fix the stuttering!!!! This is unbearable - after the game shows its first ad it continues to run only in slo-mo - it's not longer possible to time any jumps. I would really like to continue playing it, but this makes me throw my phone away .."
"Lost all progress twice at this point; when changing phones last year and when it started crashing when I tried to open it today, so I had to reinstall. After having reached level 60 and having approximately 20k coins after buying everything in the workshop, this is incredibly annoying. Would have given four or five stars otherwise, but will not start from the beginning to play anymore."
"At first I thought of this game as an average one, which can be played to pass time, but I put real time and effort into reaching my level and unlocking my players. Now that I switched devices, I found out I would have to redo all my progress because even though my achievements are saved, my progress isn't. Thanks a lot for making all my effort go to waste. I won't bother playing again so that more time is wasted. I am disappointed that you do not save progress and I am now deleting the app"
I played the original Alto to level 53 and love it. This one is a great alternative but has some serious rediculous expectations. Like the wall grinding across chasms succeeds 1/10 times. Nighttime is way too dark. Wall grinding seems inconsistent. It's set up where you need the perfect balance of speed and timing. discouraging and unfair. Character seems to slow down more than in original also which greatly impacts surviving chasms.
"Bugs bugs bugs. Every time I reach a high score around 220000 the freaking thing crashes, every time I beat my distance record the game crashes shortly after, and to add salt to the wound, the freaking game forgets my 20000 combo goal. Fix the damn game! Playing on a clean Samsung S8 ffs, do I need a 1000 dollar iPhone to make the game work?"
"Nice game ruined by intrusive advertisements. Ads to continue on after a failure at your own choice are fine and in most games. Loud, obnoxious, intrusive, long and unwanted ads at random moments are never o.k. and this game has them in spades. Gameplay and graphics are fine and I heard the game.was good so I grabbed it but the whole thing is ruined by the intrusive ads which really breaks any sort of gameplay. It may have been good once but not anymore. Not recommended."
Can't get past the tutorial because it stops every 2 seconds to tell me something and thus breaking my speed. There is no way to turn off the hints that pause the game either. It seems like it would be cool if they allowed you to get past the tutorial.
"Amazing scenaries and landscapes. described as a ""relaxing"" and sould easily have 6* out of 5 if it weren't for poor strategic decisions. Quantitative objectives are very stressfull and the game change its gameplay to create an addiction. Also lemurs who chase you are a really stressfull, unecessary, incomprehensible feature that don't motivate to play at all and ruins the experience. gameplay features like wall ride are cool. Also ads are really long (60 sec) and the flying suit is useless"
"I still see ads even though I purchased the option to remove them. This is probably because I have two email accounts on this device, but this definitely shouldn't happen and the bug must be solved. The game it self is great though, please resolve the bug"
"2 things to do, last 2 days and get 350k point and the game crashes everytime i get over 200k for no reason. congrats, you did the most frustrating unending game I've ever played. I mean, it was cool but this ruined everything. uninstalling. (and the ads are a bit annoying)"
"The game would've been an 5 starer if not for bugs, it always crashes when I get past 20k meters and all progress is lost its like the game doesn't want me to have an high score, the developer doesn't release any updates fix this bugs, there's no contact support, it's like we're playing an demo version"
"boy, when they don't want you to come close to being able to finish a level, they pull out all the stops. one of my favorites was having to get something to smash a rock. but it's so high up that its literally impossible to get. or putting a magnet (it attracts coins) right behind a rock. making it, you guessed it, impossible to get. but then, the longer they keep you playing, the more ads they can assault you with. and that, after all, is the point."
"I did really love this game off and on for months, whenever I found some spare time to play. That is, until they slowly added progressively more and more intrusive advertisements into into it. Until it was hardly playable anymore."
"This game was incredible, i played it all the time, the animation and the music was so relaxing. Now ive updated it and there are horrible ads every 3 deaths and everything is ruined. I will never be able to play again ð. I must delete Altos Odyssey."
"The game itself is pretty good (although I did prefer Altos Adventure), but the ads completely ruin it. There is nothing relaxing about playing this game simply because of the relentless ads. I understand WHY ads are needed, but wow, I spend almost as much time waiting for the ads to finish as I do playing. Sorry, deleting."
"The damn pop-up ad was unskippable and on top of that was stupidly long and annoying. Also the gameplay on each level only exp was earn and no extra coin rewards, while the item and item upgrade are highly expensive and it took a hard grind just to make enough coins for a simple one way gameplay style."
"Exactly same as the first one, overrated af. Literally no difference except for the background. Gameplay is just staring at the screen and occasionally tapping it. Apart from that graphics and music are good . Still not worth it ."
I switched my SD card I was told that Google Play would reinstall the game and save my progress and I wouldn't have to purchase it again. Now BOTH Odyssey and Adventure are problematic. Odyssey won't even install an Adventure put me right back to the beginning wiping out all my progress and purchases :/ :( I don't know what it is I have other games that also won't install but other games that are installed without any problems my guess is they're running on Android 9 and I'm only Android 8?? Idk
This game is made to screw you over. Rocks blend into the background so you run in to them often without realizing it was there then the back flips screw you over by giving you a place to do a jump then it ends up being too short so you crash and the flip feels sluggish and not very fun to do. For a game that is supposed to be relaxing it sure makes me angry.
"Used to be a great and simple game that could entertain for hours. Ads were optional and provided extras if you were willing to watch. However, the game now forces you to watch ads, but gives you no benefits unless you agree ahead of time. What a shame."
Changing to 1 star simply for making advertisement so central in the game play. At least place them smartly. There are places where the character simply jumps into a new chasm right after recovery through ads! Great visuals & music.
"I used to play this game some years ago and it is a beautifully made game if nothing else, but I downloaded it again some days ago and it has so many ads that it broke the experience .and it's the kind of ads that have small x buttons so you cant properly press them to turn them off . Real pity."
"Nice zen game with nice music and artwork but too many ads and the power ups are useless, it's either you miss them from tricks, jumps, or speed. Due to that coins are useless, really only useful to skip goals or continue on. I would also love to see more biomes."
"1. Your game crashed when I was about make a high score of near 52,000 meters. Later I was about to complete near 45,000 meteres when again it crashed. Also there was no sign for any of my new highscores in stats option as if this didn't happen at all. And at level 60 it asks for 350,000 score points. How will I surpass that if game crashes like this. 2.How do lemur crashes me while I'm in air. As you can clearly see I love your game, its addictive. But these issues i faced needs to be fixed!"
"one- touch system for doing everything is the most frustrating and stupid thing I've endured for a while, nothing works and never jumps. after you're forced to be killed because you can't do what you want you have to sit through 6 hours of ads to get to get to the menu, it's quicker to just exit the app restart completely. Long story short, I can't even play the game f.u."
"Great game.... EXCEPT.... Terrible ads... They used to be better and short, but now they are long, and in some cases, I'm unable to close them without closing the app. I literally stay away from any apps that have obtrusive ads to deprive them off my time and money... One day companies will figure it out and get some of my disposable income... One day."
"When your character crashes you have the option to watch a video and continue from where you left off.  Or you can just restartreatart.  Which, more often than not, forces you to watch a video (or two) that can't be canceled unless you end the whole app.  I have a low tolerance for forced full screen ads!  I kept the game for a while hoping it was a bug that would be fixed because the game itself is pleasant, but no.  If anything the ads have gotten even more prevalent and thus this review."
"This could be a fun game but unfortunately it is full of microtransactions. It didn't take even five minutes until it shoved them in my face. Also every time you fail (which will happen a lot) they want you to watch ads to continue. If you don't, you have to start right from the beginning again."
"Absolutely horrendous. Why make a game where the best option 90% of the time is doing nothing? You can collect coins that get you killed and do flips if you have an hours worth of airtime to do it, otherwise you die. So what am I supposed to do exactly? Just tap to jump over the occasional rock or gap I guess. The visual experience is fine, it's just too bad they forgot to add actual gameplay."
Ten Star Game. But i have to use the old 1 star trope to make developer listen. Seriously guys you cant have game crashing when a player is making 7 figure score. Also google play high score is always a mismatch and my high scores dont sync. Also the leaderboard is hacked. You cant have best distance time as two years of real physical time.p
"Great game and lots of fun, but it keeps crashing on me. I'm on level 60, and get to 325,000 points (of the 350,000 required) and the games freezes and shuts down. It's happened to me 5 times now."
"Only ""relaxing"" if you consider ads soothing. You must opt in to an ad to continue the same run after crashing, an often times unfair experience itself due to the procedurally generated levels, and then forced to watch an ad on occasion anyway if you choose to simply restart from the beginning. And the purchase to remove ads does not apply to the opt in ads, so there is no way to pay for what would be an otherwise pleasant experience. It's insulting."
"So I tried redownloading this game after a year or so on a new device and the game is still as buggy as ever. You can play just fine for a while but then the game gets choppy, your character randomly flips and crashes, falls through the ground, just so many bugs. I had hoped the developers would have fixed this but Alto's Adventure is still much less buggy and enjoyable."
I dont understand how this garbage get so much ratings there are too much of unskip adv. And about the game play the charecter always crashes due to horrible graphics and when we actully die or dive to the vally the the balloons pop up. Too alow for a graphics. But have to improve.
"Can't play anymore due to freezing. Was great for a while, but the last several weeks it locks up my phone every time I try to play it. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but that doesn't fix anything."
"Would be a great game, but is absolutely frustrating. Marketed as relaxing but just annoying. Does not register jumps, completely random whether you are going to land on a rock and end your run, then watch a video to continue from a fall that was the games fault. I get the atmosphere, but it's much too dark to decipher the small obstacles, even with phone brightness up."
In the middle of a game it will teleport me underground and kill me instantly. This has happened a few times recently. Another reason for 1 star is you purchase the compass feature and it requires you to pay 1000 coins every time you use it. This is clearly greedy bait to buy in app currency and or purchase double coins scarf. It actually benefits you more to watch ads in game rather than play it in order to progress upgrades without paying real money. You guys are ruining gaming
"It's fun, but having to shut the game down after each run is really tiresome. I'm not going to let the ads run and use my data, and theres no way to exit out of them. Theyve ruined a really fun and relaxing experience, unfortunately. I'm aware apps need to generate revenue, but at least give a way to close the ad. And I can promise that I will NEVER download an app that is shown on an ad that cant be closed. Maybe its just me, but that's the hill I choose to die on lol."
Cannot distinguish between obstacles and the background and trees. The play area and background are very similar colors and no matter what an eyesore to play especially the lightning. Tutorial doesn't explain anything and it is almost impossible to jump over chasms. Game lasted 10 minutes on my phone. Would not recommend at all - unless the dev's want to pay me too? no way this game is 4.7 rated.
"The look and feel is great, the music is great, but sadly the game is horrible! Struggled to even pass level 2. The obstacles look very similar to the plants, you will end up crashing all the time. The back flips are horribly implemented. Forget about the game rating (these can be easily cheated) look for the ratings of the Gameplay, and Controls for the real rating which is 3.9"
"played this game years ago, unlocked everything, beat every challenge, still played tons. it was a very atmospheric and soothing experience. Now that atmosphere is ruined by terrible ads. what was once relaxing is now jarring and stressful."
"Fun game - great atmosphere and graphics and enjoyable ""pick up and play"" / ""one more go"" gameplay. Completely ruined by insufferable adverts every time you die. I would happily pay to purchase the game and avoid these adverts, but sadly this not an option that is offered."
"It was good in the beginning. Now I have to watch ads in their entirety after most plays. Other apps have adds but they don't force you to watch them till they end, 5 seconds and you can skip. But this stupid game doesn't allow you to and it even hides the way to skip even if there is one. Unistalling this."
"Much more cluttered and low-contrast- more eye-straining chore than timing when jumping rocks. You can pay to get rid of adverts, but I couldn't get enough playtime between adverts to decide if it was worth it. The first game was so zen... but after 30 seconds of play and three minutes of ads, this one made me want to smash my 'phone. Is it worth paying a couple of quid to remove ads? No idea, and can't be bothered enduring ad-bullying just to find out. Uninstalled."
"Wanna know why rated 1 star? I got EVERYTHING fair and square, but every time i get even a DECENT run it closes immediately. i hate this and it ruins the experience. i once did a 100,000 meter run, then it closed down and i had to restart. THAT TOOK OVER 10 MINUTES! i hate this app now, and im not downloading it again til it is fixed."
"Total scam game designed to force you to spend 70% of the time watching vile vids to continue. I completed one task at least six times and never once got credit for it. Crashes frequently, controls are garbage as well!"
"Awful. A hideous tutorial that gaslights you as you try to learn how to play by doing things like disabling jump entirely to ""show"" you something, or constantly interrupting you to tell you to gain speed to overcome an upcoming obstacle that you can't deal with because it's pausing to tell you something every couple of seconds before you reach it. I wouldn't waste your time."
The intro is an oying and makes me do the same part over and over with all the pop ups and won't allow me to even gain speed to jump and flip and then resets to the same spot over and over. Extremely aggravating. Would not recommend.
Everything is good except for lack of music that happens after every forced pop up ad after crashing. I have to close the app and start it again for music to play while going downhill. Music is very important part of the experience while playing and without it it's just not fun. Please take a look at this issue.
"Really bad experience. I used to love the previous version. This second installment really sucks because they included a bunch of ads and increased the difficulty for no reason. Thanks to the ads, each round take to much to restart when you lose, unless you pay. This is not in my cell phone anymore."
"Good concept, but executed so terribly a 2 year old could do it better. Every run i encounter impossible obsticles involving wallrides and or chasms. Its not a matter of skill its a matter of rng. Later i returned to game and i am missing half my progress with no option to contact devs? DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IT IS SO BAD"
"Great game but now every 2 runs I get a 30 second unskippable ad? Makes the whole game unplayable and what's worse is its the only game that I've seen with this long of an unskippable ad for no benefit to me? Ridiculous decision that ruins the game entirely. Also, golf clash sucks stop advertising it!"
"Too many ads now compared to the first one! Totally removed the user experience! If the ads comes up for you to continue playing after falling, then it's fine. But not every other time you replay! So so disappointed with this. I loved the first one."
"This game is a great example of why mobile gaming will never be as successful as pc and console. It's overly challenging, repetitive and bombarding you with the most aggressive ads. I paid nothing for this game and still feel robbed. Yuck!"
Multiple characters to choose from and yet Maya is the only usable character but cant make it across large chasms. There's not a single character that can actually play the game properly. Characters should each have a unique ability but then be able to upgrade their normal abilities like speed. Achievements can be impossible that requires the generated landscape scenario to be very specific in order to achieve. They should make sure they give people the ability to accomplish achievement them.
I would give it zero stars if I could. I've been playing a while and to advance to the next medal you have to go through other levels each separated by 400 to 500 trophies. You earn 8 trophies for coming 1st and 2nd and lose 12 trophies for coming 3rd or last. I have been at this one level for months. It was not like this. The number of trophies won and lost has changed. There is no fun in this game and it's becoming more frustrating to play. Uninstalling.
Time limits make it to where people can just wait the time out and it's as if the game wants you to lose when it makes you draw cards because of the cars it gives you but the worst part is the fact that you can play a 100 coin game when you have 400 and at the end of the match if you lose then you have little to no coins left at the end of it even though the buy in was only 100 coins. I do not recommend this uno game if you actually want to have fun while playing. Too many ads also. 1-10: 0
"Video ads after every game. Games limited to 3 minutes. In game currency and other BS. Ads have fake close buttons that launch the play store. Ads have loud audio that isn't muted by default. No offline mode. Ugly, dated and laggy UI. Annoying and repetitive in game sounds and narration. Annoying music. Overly complicated menu system. Social media ""integration""."
"This game is designed to force players to pay for coins to participate in games. You can play 10 games in a row and win 1000 coins, lose once and lose 1700 coins. The trophy system is a joke. Win a game get 8, lose a game and lose 12. The time given to play a card allows people to purposely run the clock out. And you'll see the exact same game played repeatedly if you pay attention. I get the hand of (2) +4, (1) wild, and two pairs of blue and green, and win it everytime as I know the pattern."
"Too many pop up ads even after you pay the $2 to go ad free! And what the craps up with the 5 second countdown before the game starts! Get rid of that bullcrap we dont need a count!ð EDIT: I played the game a lot over about 6-8 months and was excellent at it and got up to 1 million coins and then all of a sudden the ""BOTS"" have all but taken over. Do not try and tell us UNO that you haven't rigged the games for everyone to lose so they have to buy more coins and make you richer! RIGGED!"
"The game, in the past was fun but now the game seems rigged. You timeout too quickly. The game stalls at opportune moments. The story mode is a joke. It doesn't let you try to get the move you need to complete the three goals. If you complete one goal during one game it should let you continue to get an individual goal per game. But it works against you too much and too often. It matches you with players in the 2v mode that are playing for a different goal."
"I expected this to be an app where I could play Uno with my friends, but it seems to be more trouble than it's worth. Once I was finally able to play a real game I found out I didn't have enough coins to play with 8 people (the size of my friend group). After winning a round, I choose ""Classic x8"" only to see that I have no say in who plays with/against me. This is the worst version of Uno yet. Maybe it was user error but it shouldn't be so difficult."
"I just wanted to play uno. Instead, there was experience, levels, and micro transactions. there was a voice that called out skip, draw two, draw four, and reverse. there were ""coins"" required to initiate a game, and a time out. keeping long games from ever happening. The card game is fun because it's simple, but stretegic. I would rather pay one time to play the original game than never pay anything to play this atrocity."
"takes a very long time to load and needs to reload every time you click out of the game. You are forced into tutorials that are unskippable, and once you start a game, you are not allowed to quit until the game is over. There is also an announcer that announces every single card play, and the only way to disable it is to disable sound entirely. There is also a time limit of 3 minutes on each game, which is incredibly short, seeing as some rounds of Uno in real life can last several hours."
"UPDATE:: I stopped playing for a few months and when I returned my game data was erased. Lost all my coins and gems, had to start the game over from scratch. What a waste of time.-------------------- For Uno lovers only. I've played a few other Uno apps and this is definitely the best one. If you're good you win tons of coins to keep playing and even when you loose all your coins they give you lots of options to get free ones. The 2v2 is awesome if you get someone to play with."
I liked it but now you lose too many coins. to play it cost coins and then you have to have a minimum amount then when you lose you go bankrupt instead of them taking the proper amount from you that the other team won. too many pop ups as well. not enough ways to get coins. and it wants us to buy coins only to loose them in the next 10 mins. then the shields that help are super rare or u have to pay for it. Not worth my money or time. Uninstalling.
"If you're not buying coin/gem packages, you won't enjoy the game. The ""Wild"" games seem to be cursed, you get stuck with someone who doesn't know how to play the game in the ""2 vs 2"" and lose all your coins, and it takes FOREVER just to build your bank back up to play one game and lose again. I used to love playing this game, but it seems like it's damn near impossible to win anymore. But they do give you an option to ""BUY BACK YOUR COINS"" that you've lost. What a setup!"
"I guess I'll get the good out of the way first, it's Uno, if you're playing this you likely know what Uno is. There are also a lot of cool variations in this app. Sadly the flaws make none of that matter. The ads manipulate you by putting an X in the corner but the x actually just leads you to the ad page. But the biggest issue is it's pay to win, there are items you can buy that increase your points by 10% at the end of the game in RANKED. So if you don't have a LOT of money, avoid this game."
"This game is very reliant on ads to be able to continue playing, which is fine, I got used to that. Recently, the ads won't even load and you have to restart the app and you lose out on your rewards because the ads never loaded. I agree with others on how win/loss stats are not in your favor. I just uninstalled, it was fun for the past few weeks but not any more."
"It's so easy to lose coins! If you don't have coins, you can't play. It would make sense if there was an easier way to collect coins to play, perhaps an hourly 50+ coins - but that's not the case. It's just frustrating. UNO could have been a fun game I would want to play with my boyfriend really quick - like 8 Ball Pool - but a lot of the times we find ourselves trying to scrape up coins from our lucky spins or something just to end up losing them all and not being able to play again right away."
"RIGGED Money making scheme for Mattel. I played ranked mode for a while, and I can't tell you how many times I came within a few points of earning the next star, only to lose at the last second. If it wasn't for this, I would've made expert rank and then some. As it is, I've been stuck on crystal for weeks. Almost impossible to advance without buying diamond(in game money) which you can only get thru extremely hard tasks or watching a million ads. Also, desperately needs a quit game option."
"Do you want to play a game where some skill and thought goes into your chances of winning? Well this is not the game for you. Matches are basically predetermined out of the gate, the amount of skip cards in the deck must be be close to 25% or higher. They need to lower the quantity of special cards in the entire deck. The amount of skips, color changes, +2 draw, and the color change +4 is way to high. I've never seen so many special cards, including opponents that have a full hand of them."
Like many others have said in numerous reviews and comments. The coin system is disgusting! It's all based so that you eventually lose all your coins over a couple losses even if you've been on a winning streak. Winning=Few coins Losing=Losing all of your coins. Just so they can urge you to buy coin packs. I really loved playing the game but after running into this issue more than a few times I'm going to delete the app. Leg me know when it's fixed!!
"Just bad. The game is decent in the aspect that you can play with friends, but that's it. The currency system makes it so you must have coins to play, so if you have a losing streak, it's just beating a dead horse since you have to wait another day just to lose again. The only other option to play is through saved up cards, which aren't a guarantee, or microtransactions. Would not recommend."
"Well, I played a few rounds and there are many elements here that over complicate the simple game of Uno. First off, why couldn't I skip the tutorial? I had no interest in it. Another qualm is the lack of simply playing 1v1 with friends (unless I am missing something). Instead of all the flashy lights and additions, I'd like to play simply classic Uno."
"Love the game and play quite often. Opponents are constantly cheating, by waiting to play or draw cards to the very last second or allowing the game to ""time out"" before playing a card or drawing. It gives you the option to report these players but it seems as absolutely nothing is done about it so reporting them is useless. Wouldn't have a problem with the game, as when there is no cheating, it's really quite fun. Would give zero stars if I could because the cheating is a HUGE issue!!"
"Your algorithm is built to build you up slightly if you slowly work your way up in the lower areas which is fine but it still ends up becoming a waste of time right? Slowly going up and down that's a stupid gamble it goes nowhere it's only fun if you're just wanting to play uno so we add the multiplyer to the table. great a faster way to lose all of your coins putting you back down to work your way back up slowly again. When I win on x20 800 everyone else 8000, does that make sense?"
"If I could give lower I would- I've been playing uno for a long time, spent money on it, etc. What I've realized is it's a money scheme. They'll say ""sorry you had a bad few games"" when you only won twice then lost 6 in a row, this has happened multiple times, & I mean the game would be over in seconds, not even a chance to win. Basically they let you win, make you lose everything so you either buy their coins/diamonds, or watch their videos that they still getting paid for. Deleted it for good."
"Would not suggest. It is fun at first but you eventually lose all your coins. When you take a loss you lose just as many (sometimes more) coins than when you win. Which in a game where your chances of winning are randomized, you tend to lose alot. It can also cause players to stop playing and uninstall the game."
"App is awful. Prefer original. It rushes you through the game, suggests which cards to play, in every round with no consideration for you looking to strategize. Can't turn that off in the settings. I was asked mid game, after a wild-card was played, if I thought one of the players had blue cards. How should I know? When I answered no, I was penalized, lost my turn and had to draw cards! ð"
"I had to edit my rating. Most of what everyone is saying about the coin system is true. At least explain why I'm playing a X4 game and losing 1500 coins. However there a at least a half dozen ways to earn free coins. It just takes a little more exploring. My biggest issue is my progress or lack thereof on the ranking games. As soon as I start progressing up in rank the game starts glitching or I get some idiot partner ""bot"" that makes the most fatal moves. Fix this or lose a player."
"Horrible connection and rule sets. I'm literally sitting next to my internet router and the game keeps stopping to reconnect. For whatever reason, games are limited to 3 minutes each, and there's a bizarre scoring system that only comes into play then. in my last game, I played my last card as the timer ran out, and it didn't count, and someone with 4 cards left was declared the winner. It just isn't fun."
"Wait to play. The game is fun, it's uno. But unless you win way more often than you lose (hard to do because so much luck involved), then you get stuck playing for a few hours and having to wait till tomorrow for more free coins or pay to stock up. I think the general idea is good, but add a free to play mode that doesn't cost coins to enter for people to keep playing while waiting for the ranked games."
"I wish I could give this game a good review because I loved uno as a kid and love watching videos on the desktop version, but with reviews mentioning constant glitches and simply bad app design, as well as my app simply not working, I can't give it a rating low enough. The game gets to the main menu, brings up a loading circle, the menu options disappear, and then it just sits there forever. I even let it sit for half an hour with no change."
"The game is made to sell ads, period. It's not fun and it cheats not only with what card you and your opponents get, but how many coins you lose per game. If you go bankrupt, you have to watch an ad to keep playing, so it's in Mattel's best interest to purposefully make certain people (who either are more likely to put money into the game or those who are willing to watch a few ads to gain more coins so they could keep playing) lose more coins more often. After playing for a while, that is true."
"The win/loss ratio is horrible. I understand the game and win most matches I play. The design is you'll receive roughly double your entry fee if you come in second and 4x for first. The issue is that it's a 3x loss for 3rd and often more than a 6x loss if you come in 4th. Like others, I made it to many thousands only to end up at zero, not even playing large multipliers. The game is designed to be fun, but also so that you lose your coins. Avoid it, too many ads anyway."
"For every 30 seconds there is a glitch.. Sometimes when I have a game winning move, It freezes...and auto plays. The game is addictive and good time pass... But with too many glitches and frozen screens.. I end up slapping my mobile screen, as it kills the fun part. After playing, I'm more frustrated, and wishing for the next game to have a smooth run. I have moved on to another game, and not spend so much time in this.. Hope you fix it soon. I love this game, used to be my stress buster."
This game is absolutely rigged to take all of your coins so you can buy more. The algorithms just don't add up with game play. Almost makes you think you are playing against bots sometimes or have bot teammates. It takes way too many coins at a time if your points build up in hand and everything is just highly exaggerated from ads and so on. I have caught the game do these weird things that just don't make sense often even after knowing all the rules it still will blatantly do certain things.
This game is nothing more than a money-grabbing pay-to-play app from the developer. If you don't watch enough ads or don't pay for the extra coins etc then you lose until you're out of coins. As each match requires a minimum amount of coins your options are then to either buy coins or not play. Shameful approach.
"Yet again.... thank you for absolute irritating and non-sensical feedback. Yes.... whether I'm at home or in a town 70km away... it is not a network problem. Please make sure...once again... that the adverts don't stick halfway through when you actually have to RE-BOOT your phone or PC. Re-connecting... re-connecting for 5 minutes, or the game starts halfway through. Love the game, but you guys need to work on it. I am not the only person saying so........................................."
"I hate to give this one star, but I hope that it and the many other recent negative ratings will spur change. As stated by others, the game play itself is *EXCELLENT*! However, the ads are so frustratingly intrusive - most are 15-30 seconds long. Some ads don't even ask for your permission but take you straight to the Google Play store to download it after playing the ad. And the biggest kick in the nuts is that many ads require clicking the X twice and if you're not precise you get redirected."
"Was good initially, but after about 20 games I now I get bombarded and spammed with ads and constant popups attempting to get me to spend money on rubbish. I get so many popups and ads its annoying to the point where even if I wanted to purchase something, I wouldn't just because of principle! Will be deleting the app"
"Been playing for well over 1 year and won some decent coins. Anyone recently notice when playing 2v2, your partner either forgets to press UNO or times out/throws random cards or even just missing in action?? Its like your partner is a BOT and makes you lose the game. There will be times I win continously and lose continously when with great cards...all because my parter defaults and fails intentionally. Its like developers doesnt want you to succeed in passing $70K coins."
"I find myself constantly losing whenever I play UNO, and it's becoming frustrating. To make things worse, my teammates seem to make poor decisions, which often lead to our team's defeat. It's hard to enjoy the game when my teammates don't seem to understand basic strategies or make careless mistakes. Moreover, the frequent ads in the game are really bothering me. Almost every time I finish a round or start a new game, an ad pops up, disrupting the flow of gameplay. ðð"
"Game is a joke! There's no point in downloading this game at all! You lose more than you win! They make you watch ad after ad for free coins just to lose the coins as you get them! Game use to be fun but it's a pay to play game! Which I wouldn't recommend buying cause if you do, you lose really fast! Either way find a better card game and stay clear away from this one!"
This app is becoming a joke. I love the game but it is fixed. I have spent time collecting eggs and then reach the 6 star one but never get the card I need just ones I have before. Surely you should earn the right to collect a new card if you have taken the time to get that far. You also lose a lot more games than you win. Definitely fixed. The reply is a joke. I play high levels and these are the eggs collected in the egg hunt event. ð¡
Tired of this game... I think I'm just disappointed at how much it has changed. The cheating. The ads. The data collecting. I read the contracts and I'm no longer gonna be a part of this game. The fishing and the privacy is what is disturbing to me just to play a simple game of Uno that learns how I play and teaches my strategy to the whole game. I'm finally done with this game. Very disappointing. Most of the matches are generated or fixed.
"This game has its times of being super fun but between getting more and more poorer hands the higher your wealth and just plain idiot teammates in team... Do yourself a favor, find some good teammates and hope the AI gives you a decent hand. There's a lot of BS flashy gambly stuff. Worth playing for a few weeks and uninstalling. Oh and there have been plenty of times someone plays a draw 4, calls a color they don't have, you challenge it and lose. Oh and developer auto response: a total KMA resp"
"Okay, one, it's whole 'coin fee' for playing a match, is a lie. It's SUPPOSED to be, for example, 120 coins if you lose, for a 4000 coin game, (you have to have 4000 coins to play a 4000 coin game, is what it implies) but INSTEAD you lose MORE THAN 7000, or, I did, because if you don't have 7000 you can't lose 7000, but you get the point, they charged me WAY extra! That was at least 60 games, and the games you play, you have to GAMBLE? WHY? Two, this game is just plain, old, bad."
"Pathetic that the game that we grew up playing with so much joy, is now designed similar to a gambling card game. It could have very easily been a point based system. Where you play with any combination of rules and each win attributes to points that could show your standing on the leader board. Instead the game now has a buy in where if you can win big you can also lose, just as big. It is a game of chance, but it takes away the innocence of the game. A bad experience overall."
"The game is fun. But the game really goes against you. How can you lose 10 times in a row, then win once, then lose again 10 times in a row? Seems like the game is rigged so you run out of coins and buy more. I'm about to delete it and download another one."
I was so addicted to this game. But now it seems something fishy. I had 19k coins then suddenly am loosing every match and winning rewards are so so less than losing amount. Either am getting matched with the unexperienced players or the opposite team gets 2-4 action cards which we don't get. Now I have about 9k coins. I can't imagine I lost 10k continuously. If we win we get 100-120 and if we lose then it's 500-1000. This is so irritating and disappointing.
I'm always getting just number cards. My partner as well as both of my opponents are always getting the draw 4 wild card and draw 2 cards. Every time I challenge the wild draw 4 card I wind up drawing 6 cards. When I throw out a wild draw 4 card and my opponents challenge it I wind up drawing 4 cards. When you look at ads they promise to give back coins you lost sometimes you don't get it. That's why I say this game is rigged.
"Disgustingly long ads. I went from really liking this game to hating it because of the loooong ads that go about for a few minutes without any option to skip. The frequency is also high: After every 2 or 3 games, you have to watch such an ad, which just destroys the experience. And you can forget about the invitation that you sent to your teammate for rematch as they would be long gone while you were watching a super long weird ad."
My Uno Road map has stopped at 10000 points and won't go any further than that ð© Why is this.?? I keep emailing your company and they keep saying nothing is wrong ð¤ My Uno Road won't go further than 10000 points it maybe go up by a couple of points then it goes back to 10000 no matter how many games I win or lose ð­ð­ How am I meant to progress.?? I can't..It's been like this for months now so obviously I can't progress...
"This game is so rigged!!! Litteraly played games and have zero chance to win.ending up with over 243 points because other team has draw 2 and draw 4, while I have zero. This has not been a 1 time thing it is repetitive. The only reason I got to even play those is watching hundreds of ads. Which btw you dont alway get the the reward for watching them. Majority of the time, I have won it is for little amount, but when I lose it is huge losses. When I did get a big win I would get a bigger loss."
"Game is WASTE OF TIME... it's good IF you spend real money but if you don't YOU have to watch ADS all the times to get coins. There's nothing you can earn coins easily NONE. So you have to watch ads and not only that, it's ALWAYS ads every time you finish a game and it's getting annoying ð ð ð´ ð .... So it's a WASTE OF TIME....."
"Monetization is so intense in this game, can't play without the interruption of adverts. Too cluttered and not user friendly, way too many modes of game play that makes it redundant at times."
Worst game.. win percentage is very less.. if you are addicted or pay attention to play this game always you will loss the game. Overall it's a worst game and don't take it serious while playing the game. Totally disappointed. If you want to win in the game buy some coins. If you pay the money you will get better games. It's just like buying happiness for useless game.
"Pay to play even with ads.... Played for a few weeks, had fun, watched tons of ads for coins.... but I guess I've played long enough without paying that the servers have decided that I'm not welcome anymore. Seems like I've reached the point where they're not giving me any more coins from just watching ads and they want me to pay. Uninstalling, was fun while it lasted."
"Worst algorithm I have ever seen! You lose more than you win, so that you have to ""purchase"" more coins just to play. There are many other card games that you can play without having to ""purchase"" something in order to play! Do yourself a favor, and find other games."
"Game is fine, BUT what nonsense is the +4 wild card is for...in classic mode it works one way, in wild mode it works on its own wish.... that's completely RIDICULOUS!!! If we hv any complicatedly working cards, there shud be clear instructions given somewhere within the app...but for this one, there no where any clear instructions mentioned!! Its Really pathetic, due to coding glitch with this card I've lost so many games!!!ð¡ð¡ð¡"
"I don't want to play against people, but as far as I can tell, there's no ""play the CPU"" option. Edit after feedback: Looks like it's possible, but there's an implication that it's only ""free"" a certain number of times (whatever that eventually means) and you're forced to play games that have time limits unless you're willing to pay for some exorbitantly expensive, time limited ""room upgrade."" Edit 2: Watched an ad to get a ""lucky ball,"" but when the ad finished, nothing happened. What a scam."
"Coins in this game are terrible you lose one high value game you will have to restart and the ""shields"" you get are only useful for each mutipler making it so that you will not be able to save yourself if the game goes bad plus they give you an option to recover the coins but depending on how many coins you lost you it will cost you real money. And there should be a cap or a save point. Cap: max coins lost per match is 1000 or save so you don't have to restart from 80x to 2x save time and energy"
This app is very biased. Also when you win you get very less coins but when you lose they take a huge amount. You will get frustrated while playing sinse once you start losing you will not be able to win
Ads unplayable and stuck at the beginning. Can't even go back and had to restart the app EVERYTIME. This game is also rigged. Everytime I lose i keep losing +3k coins but when i win only getting 1k coins IN THE SAME MODE. What a joke!
"I used to love playing this game alot but since last month or so, after the update, the app has started glitching out of no where, whether I change my network from wifi to mobile data and vice-versa, it's still glitching. Disappointed."
"Honestly this game is pretty bad, I'm constantly getting flooded with pop-ups and ads, but that's not that bad if you couldn't run out of coins in a game where you need coins to play. If someone makes you draw as their final card you literally can't do anything about it for whatever reason and oddly enough I just so happen to get actually decent cards when I can't use them, and worst of all is the match fee, I can already barely afford to play as it is but the match fee makes it 100x worst."
I've played at least 20 games today and I lost all of them. They claim they have no bots but they are filled with them. The people with pictures of buildings and landscapes= fake. Mattel keeps lying about the fact that they use bots to keep you playing. The fact is no one is playing or wants to play this. I love uno tabletop but this game is a poor represention of the classic card game.
"Why is uno deliberately trying to make me lose all my coins, block me from friends and make me lose every match non stop? Is it because I gave a bad review? I deleted it. I have spent some hundreds with you all.. and u make me lose every game. Even classic 2!!! Unbelievable, like the game says. I spent $$$$ with y'all, not the free version. Worst game ever. !!!!! Warning do not spend $$. They will cheat you wit robots. Do not play this game"
"Since the recent update, the game glitches so bad it's hard to even play, sometimes impossible! The screen will go crazy and you can't make anything out, then the game will freeze and close out. That's especially awesome when it happens when I'm in the middle of playing a game!"
Full of ads. Limits gameplay as once you run out of coins your done for 24hrs. Not like you can control the cards you get. Game also gives huge advantages to players that have played for a long time. Therefore the match maker is obviously broken. Save your time and download something else.
At the end of every match there is an ad. And the frustrating thing is each and every ad will freeze the app and the only workaround is to restart the game.
"Posts cards without me clicking, doesn't give me the option to pass or play when it's supposed to, won't let you quit the game if you don't want to play anymore, makes you lose a challenge WHEN YOU HAVE THE COLOR CARDS!! The list goes on and I'm not happy whatsoever. I miss the original version."
"The more I play, the more I'm convinced this app is rigged. It seems the game is decided before you play, the cards don't seem random at all. You can send a report to Uno that there is an issue but you can't add text so its a waste of time. New update is awful, the losses are even more unfair and frequent."
You guys need to change the order of the dealer. Being last everytime is unfair. The person that is last always gets beat up and there is nothing they can do about it. This game is fun but it gets very irritating when you're always last. The only way to win if you are last is to have multiple draw 4s. Change the order of the dealer to make the game fair
When you have over 250.000 and you lose them all by playing x80 but you never get +4 and your oponents just have one colour with a discard all and a +4 card. And this happened in 5 games in a row and I lost everything. I dont think that is just bad luck. This game keeps doing this. I win games and I just get a few coins and when I lose I lose very big amounts of coins..also the ads every two minutes are annoying. I am deleting now cause this game is seriously toxic. Bye!
"The math often doesn't add up. When you lose, you often lose more than the amount based on whether you play the 2x, 4x, 8x, etc. 3ven when subtracting the coins they charge just to play. Also, winnings often don't add up either. Only winning 400 - 600 coins, even though your opponents had a combined card count of over 800. It's like the system cheats you on both sides. Plus, the losing streak is unreal, in comparison to how often you win. I find it hard to believe that it's random."
"The only reason gave it 1 star is the game play is great. The ads ruin it for me. They're super pushy and all but invasive. Trying too exit out of a single ad a half dozen times, and being redirected over and over, stressed me out. Enough so that I'd rather uninstall the game than pay for ad free. I can deal with ads, but do better uno. Edited after developer response."
"The game is good to play but it is having disgusting logics.. Some of them are 1. let's say u have won by a big margin but the opponent is having very less number of coins then you won't get the actual number of coins that u should have got. 2. Many a times they just want you to loose coins. Opponent will have descent cards like all green, in a shot or two all gets flushed. They do so because they want you to buy coin. But only an idiot will buy coins in games"
"I gave this app 3 stars before since it was fun to play, but I had to drop it to 1 star. I had 9500 coins and lost 5 games back to back due to people who can't play. In team games, there needs to be a level ranking for the people who are joining you so they can match your skill set. Next, there are too many commercials, especially when you want to do a rematch and have to wait 30 seconds. Lastly, the game is pay to play, especially when you fall under 500 coins."
"I'm softlocked. I can't play any of the modes without paying coins and you get coins through playing or buying with real money. This is a gambling simulator. Not free to play. Also shows you more ads then you get actual turns in the game. Edit: Developer, what do you MEAN there are no betting amounts?? You literally pick what your buy in is on some modes, and in others, it's WORSE because you need a minimum of a certain amount of coins, but can lose literal thousands of coins if you're unlucky!"
This game is very much rigged Its fun but you can also almost always tell when you're going to win or lose It also is set up so when you do FINALLY have a good amount of coins Youre definitely going to lose them all so the game can try to force you to make purchases No you don't have to make a purchase Duh uno but they find ways to make it so you do have to spend money Most people run out the timer even when you're going to win Uno has done nothing about it ð¤·ââï¸
"Undeniably the worst app I've ever played. Half a dozen pop ups after every closed screen is absurd, it's not even ads for other games, it's pop ups to buy coins, buy diamonds, get your coins back, watch an ad. After. Every. Screen. I've had enough. I sat through the ads, but the pop ups even BEFORE you see how much you've won/lost is ridiculous! This game also cheats, disconnected me midgame and stole all of my coins. Don't download"
"You will not get a better rating from me, I now understand that your rules change but that is not what bugs me. This game would be fun but I am realizing that if you do not pay to play you must stay at a lower level, because when playing at a higher level you will lose all your points in one game. The last game I played 8X , I had over 3000 coins but lost them all in one round. I have found other uno games to play that are less stressful with more play time and less ads."
"This game is nice but rigged, it's either rigged for you to win or lose. There are very rare games where the game plays out like it should. Many games, it's just impossible to win, folks would get discard all same color and a +4, how can the opponent actually compete fairly? It's just a waste of time to keep playing."
"Was asked to rate 4 or 5 times in 5 minutes, closed it out because I was still forming an opinion, didn't realize they would be so relentless. Well, I'm rating. All of the pop ups in general are obnoxious. Way too many. It ruins the otherwise decent gameplay. Also, why such forced, short games? Edit: Was forced too learn how the rewards system works again, even though I have already claimed things in the pass. I get it."
The game is incredibly fun. The only thing is it is impossible to win. I played team games which you should theoretically win 50% of but I played 20 games today and won 3. They want you to buy coins to keep playing but make it impossible for you to win. This game is by far the biggest rip-offs I have ever seen in games. Do not download and go with a different game that is similar. What a way to ruin a great game. The developers are absolute retards. 3/17/23 I played the game again complete riggd
I think it's a system declared win system. Or we have to pay to win I guess. Very disappointing. Even we won the match not getting full coins due to insufficient coins in opponent. System need to take care of these things to fulfill. While playing also continuously losing even cards are good. I reached a point like to uninstall this game to reduce my frustration level. I suggest don't install this game for fun. Because it will more frustration insted of fun.
"I am now changing one rating to 1 star. I previously indicated that this game kept stacking the opponents' hands with wild, reverse and skip cards...the developer wrote back and said that is not the case, but I am back here to adjust my rating because the game CONTINUES to stack everyone else's hands while myself and other people who play this game just receive basic hands and subsequently end up losing all of coins!! Extremely frustrating game play!!!!!"
Such a bad gaming experience. Atleast have one level that has no entry cost so that players can collect coins to play the higher levels... I have to go play another game or do something with my life to pass time until I regain coins in this game! Totally annoying. Not download worthy
"Great graphics and interaction. If you play a game for 500 coin you expect to lose 500 coin. Instead you could lose 3000 coin because of your cards. This make playing this without paying for add ons; a 5 minute maybe a day game. For the amount of data and ads, this really is not worth the download. So day 3 I played for 5 minutes and I lost everything to a draw 4. So they need to take away the score system if they want a minimum bid. Or allow the option. Honestly play a different uno game."
"Completely rigged. The game chooses what cards you (and other players) get, and in order to play is if you have 100 coins. Problem, when they choose what cards people get, it almost chooses who wins, so if you lose multiple times in a row, and you don't have 100 coins, you can not play, and in order to get coins, you have to pay with real money. Its all a damn scam."
"This game has many bugs where u watcha video and itll either freeze and not give rewards. OR i WATCHED THE WHOLE VIDEO, WASTING SO MUCH OF MY TIME AND STILL NOT GETTING ANY REWARDS AFTER. Then... fix it? The ads keep freezing and I can't collect the rewards.. AFTER I FINISH MY GAME ALSO HAVR ADS BUT THEY FROZE UP!! So I cant press the X button to exit"
"The worst game I have played. If you want to be angry anytime than you can play this. Maximum times when I challenge somebody 95 % it failed and only 5% i win . Secondly in Ã200 wild , if we failed than it should take more than 100 and less than 300 but what !!!it takes about 600+ and even sometimes 1000+ coins. There are so many such things that irritate me . Please do something about it. ððð"
"The opponent gets to get the wild every time they draw a card, while I only get number cards that make me consistently lose coins. This is the most frustrating game I have ever experienced. I want to win for once but I hardly get any wild or skips or +2."
"ð¡very disappointed, have to watch videos to collect your rewards and 90% of the time the rewards don't come through even though you watch the videos numerous times... At first the app was great, now it's just taking up space... Fix the problems or delete the app..."
"Totally not worth purchasing any coins. You lose more coins than you earn when you win. Avoid purchasing anything. Just use the free coins, you'll end up losing them any way. You play for 200 and if you win, you win 40+, but if you lose you lose more than the 200. NOT WORTH IT."
"Thoroughly convinced this game is rigged. It's amazing how the algorithm only lets you win once or twice, and then you lose 10 or 15 times straight every single time. It's amazing how consistent the statistics have been over the last 90 days of playing this game Edit: 3-9-23. Is there anyway you could do something about this coin situation? It's not fair when the game said you win 1300 coins, then when checking I only win maybe half that. How?"
"Too much ads, if you play 2 minutes, you have to watch around 5 minutes for collecting in-game items. Although if you watched ads for daily prizes, you have to watch ad again between each game. That greedy program will slowly lose your interest in this game and destroy all the fun"
"Constantly matched with people who don't know how the game works, you lose more matches than you win and your loss payout is 3x what you would win. Don't bother completely ruins the concept of uno. Edit to add gameplay hasn't changed since I reinstalled. If anything it's now worse and game loss payout is 10x the win payout. Seriously don't bother because developers don't care. If I could leave a -100 rating I would"
"The useless thing about this app is that it doesn't work with mobile data & requires wifi data even from mobile hotspot. When I render my mobile data with other devices Uno works perfectly on other devices without any issue. When I use my mobile network for app in same device it doesn't work. last time when I had installed this app I had raised concern through app & I was told that app requires wifi connection to work properly. After the years, issue should've been resolved, but still same issue"
"This game is so rigged it's not even funny. I will lose 10-15 games in a row, my partner and I will NEVER get any wild cards yet the other pair of players play 4 plus 4's in a game. It's really not possible to have that bad of luck over and over and over again. Day after day. This game sucks as soon as my coins are gone it's getting uninstalled immediately."
"This game is definitely rigged. I made alot on coins and then I upped my bet and I ended up playing with bots and I ended up losing 18000 on a 20x entry. It's set up to make you feel like you have to buy coins. My son and I tested it. When you start, you play with Holly & Seth, both on my husband's start round and my sons. 100% fixed. Don't spend money on this game, ever."
"The rng in this game is garbage, you can go from having 10k to nothing in the matter of minutes, it's frustrating to do nothing but lose when you only made even just a little bit after a previous win. Your random teammates are just as bad a the RNG. It incentives to spend really currency to keep playing after you get screwed over."
"I agree with others, this game is fun but infuriating when the controls aren't cooperating, which is OFTEN. Works fine for awhile then it starts getting really quirky, especially when trying to run and you end up sliding, over and over and over again. Don't bother... you'll end up pulling your hair out or throwing your phone, or both! I even paid to upgrade hoping that would help but it didn't. No difference whatsoever. Fix the controls and I'd give this game 5 stars."
"This game was fun for the first few levels, until I found out that you need to get stars to play more levels, and to get all three stars, you need all the tricks, the tricks cost money, money is found within the levels, and the best you'll get is 30 coins, these tricks cost hundreds, you gotta play through the levels over and over perfectly to progress in the game. I would not recommend playing this unless your willing to pay."
"I love this game. But it doesn't respond to me. I can swipe up on a trick and it won't perform the trick, or I'll side swipe to accelerate and it'll slide instead. I know for a fact that it is not my phone, my phone is fairly new and has never had this problem before. This problem has ruined the game for me, because in order to get new tricks, you have to have coins, and to get the max amount of coins, you need to three star the level. Physically impossible without response. Please fix this!"
Very nice game but it is very annoying to start from beginning after each mistake you do. Since collecting stars in the levels are hard so it takes so much time in some levels. Bring checkpoints and some lives in new update
You need to revise physics. And touch controls are terrible! Please make sure that these two things get recovered as early as possible. All-over game is very good.
Not up to scratch. There should be a skill spot any way you go and the 3rd level in the technology park is impassable try escaping and stuns you from distance and try the skills they will just not work even if timing is perfect the character trips. Fix these issues and I will give you five stars. I promise!
Worst game ever. So bady optimised that the game doesn't even register half the time (not my device problem). The other problem is it's timing. If you are even 0.001 second fast or late the game doesn't work. It is very bad and makes it very bad. Litrelly the worst game ever. Play something else! Don't even try this game
I played it for 2 months... And almost wanna end the classic ones...but one day... When I opened the app... It suddenly start from the beginning... Zero points and stars...it's already happened 2 times...
"Very frustrating game. And totally waste of time. Don't play this game your just wasting your precious time. Read a book,Go to GYM,Play outdoors games. Have fun with your friends."
The could have been perfect if the guy would have taught how to jump...but I don't even know why i am writing because the developers care so less about the user feels about their game as literally every single one has the same problem and nothing has been done yet. Thank you
"The ads are ridiculous. After four ads while trying to beat a single level 8m uninstalling this, made it 20 levels in putting up with this, but it's getting stupid."
I paid â¹75 for vector unlock and they assured for saving my progress But now I've installed it again and there's no previous progress. I'm not going to play it again
Hunter mode 3-5 is bugged. Pretty stupid that you can get so far in a game and not finish it. Fix your stuff.
"The gameplay and graphics are excilent but it almost forces you to watch ads. Even after completing a level without any flaw, it gives you 1 star and very less coins whereas, to go to next level you need thousands of coins or so many stars that is literally impossible to achieve. So you need to complete each level 100 of times before moving to the next level. Uninstalling."
This game lags all the time on all phones it's annoying just fix it already event on phone's from 2023 it barely works and the jumping delay makes it impossible to play
I want to play the game but I can't. For over half a year whenever I try to launch the game it doesn't load at all. Nothing seems to make the game work but I don't want to reinstall it so I don't lose all of my progress
"This game would be getting 4-5 stars, but there is a single issue that is preventing me from getting past level 2. When I swipe my screen to sprint, it either makes me jump slowing me down and causing me to get caught, or crouch which does the the same thing. I have given this game a couple chances, but its not worth keeping on my phone."
"I love the game but there's one thing I hate. The hunter level. So after all the chase, collecting cubes and so on (including the stress) the hunter level is still the same with the classic.... The hunter is as flexible as him too and we are still forced to collect cube and tricks... What's the need of upgrading to the hunter level if we are still going to repeat the same thing we played in classic??? Fix thatððð"
"worst game ever, I swipe correctly almost every time and still it doesn't do it the way the game is programmed to. Most times where you have to swipe right for run up it will slide down so I thought it would've need my mistake so then I try to swipe very carefully but it still doesn't work. don't waste your time on this garbage game ( I've checked my phone touch and everything works fine as well)"
"This game was really fun... for the first level. After that, the tricks felt like they needed pixel-perfect timing, which isn't fun, especially in a mobile game. It feels clunky at parts as well. I wouldn't reccommend getting this if you want 100%, or don't want total bs."
"Literally does not work for longer than 5 minutes. The first level was great. Worked well, lots of fun. The second level, the tricks would trigger 50% of the time. The third level, the tricks stopped working altogether. Sometimes, the jumps and slides wouldn't even register. When I exited the app and went back into it to see if a restart would fix it, it wouldn't even launch. It literally broke after the first launch. Awful."
"This game probably old already, but I reinstalled because I loved it. But 1 star because there is this one hunter mode story required a specific moment to jump and if I missed that one moment by literally less than a second, I was considered too far. It is stupidly annoying because my experience tell me that I am still able to catch up even if I missed that jump. Please do something. It is really stupidly annoying."
My progress won't save. This happens on this free version so I bought the full game to see if that was the issue but it still happens on that version too. Any time I close the game or turn my phone off all my progress gets wiped. My phone is a Blade A3 2020-T on the latest Android version. Please fix.
"Number 1. When at windows that are meant to break through, character stops for a brief time and then keeps going, big issue with this is losing momentum. Number 2. Screwed up controls, when at a dash section, occasionally swiping right to make the character dash, will cause the character to slide, therefore getting caught and starting agian."
"Used to be great game! That was one of me most unique games, but unfortunately the UI design is horrible now. The game is not adapted to hole punch phones, and there is a big black bars from both left and right which creates huge waste of space. Also due to this black bars some option buttons is disappearing under it. All what it need is just to make it full screen and nothing else, like all the others developers who adapted their game to the new changes in hardware and software."
Such a good game but insanely infuriating. THE CUBES!. YOU'LL COMPLETE THE LEVEL AT THE BEST TIME AND DO ALL TRICKS ONLY TO GET 2 STARS BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T COLLECT THE CUBES. The infuriating part is the fact that the can be 31 cubes in a level and you get 30 and still don't get the star. Now your stuck on 7th level because you don't have enough stars to unlock the 8th
"I've uninstalled the game long time back hoping they would fix it*tonight i installed it again to see if they fixed the game or not,and yes,as suspected*STOP SAYING ""BUG FIXED"" in the update details if you really don't fix the damn bug;go through the reviews and see people complaining about the controls.The character won't respond in time which slow down the character in the process always makes the player loose the game.If u can't fix this try putting buttons for â¬ï¸â¬ï¸â¡ï¸. Same goes for Vector 2."
Game was updated and recently my game never got past the loading screen on startup. Had to uninstall and lost all my progress. Was at the last hunter world too with only a few levels left for 100% and without spending any money. Game would never load up on start up so I was forced to uninstall which meant me losing all my progress.
Worst game all levels has to be opened with coins has to constant play repeat levels
"Probably one of the worst mobile games to ever be created or fabricated in someone's head, don't download it, its awful. Its okay if you're just playing to get through but if you want to get all of the stars on each level you'll need to be pixel perfect at every little point in the level, if you make one little mistake you may as well restart. Absolutely ridiculous just dont get it, its not worth it."
"The tap recognition in this game is terrible. Either your tricks happen seconds after you swipe, or it just gets the move wrong entirely. The amount of times I have tried to jump something only to slide into it, knowing that I definitely swiped up, is stupid and infuriating. If they could get this one thing right the game would be great, but right now it's just bad game design which is super annoying."
"1. I have 3 stars on all but 1 level and the game won't unlock anything past the first 4 levels of the first section of levels. 2. The controls are completely jacked. I swipe up and it didn't respond (notice: tried it on multiple devices, same outcome on all the same missions). Many times when the special moves come up, they don't even work because of how scuffed this game is. 3. If it weren't for all the bugs and the special moves not at all working then I'd give it a 4 star, but I'm angry."
Kanjoos makhichoos game. They dont give any stars after doing the best in a level.
"It's not just pathetic but downright disgusting that the player(user on screen) just doesn't perform the perks you want him to in the most important parts! Even the gadgets that you buy disappear all of a sudden and you can't even use them... The game could have been a very good one, but failed miserably... particularly, being a Parkour game,it stands as a disgrace to its name for the bugs that have yet not been fixed that keep pulling down the gameplay to the nadir...VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
I was giving it a 5 star but the glitch that whenever i go in the game it says the game isnt responding litreally everytime in i got iphone 13 it doesnt work in it either i will not recommend this game to download.
"Parkour should be something that flows, this game makes me feel so in-raged with how annoying thw controls are and how bad the parkour is, on top of that you have to play the same missions over and over again until you get enough money(game currency) to buy the next parkour or ability to get a 100% of the mission. Its another bad game that wants you to spend money on it to get the ""full"" version."
"It's a fun concept, but that's about it. The controls only work half the time. If I swipe up, there's only a 50% chance that the guy will jump, every other time he'll either slide or stop or just do nothing. It's the same with swiping down or swiping right. Shotty controls and unbalanced gameplay seems to be a theme with Nekki games."
"Awful. Don't even waste your time downloading this game. You could spend that getting a way better game than this one. The controls are awful. Almost all of the time the controls don't register what you did. This game is nearly impossible, too. The puzzles are hard, and since the controls are awful, that makes it 10 times harder than it should be. Do NOT get this game. It is so bad."
"This game sucks. The perfection that is required to get three stars on a level is nearly impossible. Additionally, sight-reading isn't possible on some levels so you have to do some trial and error to be able to know what to do next which makes the required perfection even more aggravating."
"The movement controls suck. I swipe up to jump, he decides to slide instead. I try to input any movement after using the speed buff, he just decides to slow down and fall to his death instead. Couldn't take it more than 5-10 minutes."
"Dissapointing. I played this game when i was younger and had no issue. It was fun to play. Back when you could actually play a game without being harassed with microtransactions. Unfortunately as soon as I opened the game after installation I was bombarded with a ""Do Not Play Unless you're willing to PAY"" sign. Essentially this game is unplayable for free to play users. I'm not going to grind for some levels that I already beat as a child. Very sad that this game was ruined."
Every time I swipe up i never jump and when i slide it never slides. When I'm able to climb a ledge it stops climbing when the enemy is near by. It's a good game but every time you need to get to a new stage you have to get 33 stars which is nearly impossible.
I really don't recommend this game. Since its too difficult to collect points to open new missions. You have to get certain credit to be able to play your next mission. It doesn't work since each mission is difficult. Really bad step from the developer.
Horrible game its impossible the dumb hunter gets me every time i cannot slide properly i wasted a hour and a half on level 3 i skipped a funeral to even play this game sucks would not reccomend i would give it 0 stars but thats not a option
this is bad let it be on chrome computers i want to play it on computers but it dosent support computers!
My exprience was awful first off after level 2-8 the difficultly gets unbearable. I understand that you want a game where there is a need for patience but this is uncalled for and worst of all the tricks that you need to perform to past the level dont even have a log where we can see how to perform them its like going into a pro battle arena without knowing how to jump.
Worst app ever! It is like impossible to get 3 stars in any level even though you are pro.and it is hard to get 2 stars in levelð¶ð¶ð¶ð¶
"Very bad performance. Controls are not in your hand. Of you want to jump it slides. In this game they want a 90degree swipe up for jump, if you slightly miss by 1 degree, it slides. I don't know how it got 5 stars. 1 star deserving game only because of controls."
"you're control sensitivity is so bad. when i wanted to run, it end up sliding. and one more thing, the box point is at a very weird angle please fix this"
"bad controls. always does the wrong moves I'm telling him to do, he slides when I want to jump and jumps when I want to sprint. it's not my device as I play MCOC and it works perfectly with that game. this is just a bad game. don't waste your time."
"This game is interesting and nice, but the problem here is u need coins to unlock moves, this moves are very important to get 3 starts in a level. But to unlock each move, u will have to play a level again and again many times to collect coins and unlock them. This makes the game boring..."
"Horrible game, laggy, shut down a lot, it lagged so much that i got caught every game, DONT DOWNLOAD"
"Stupid!! App!!. When I downloaded the app there was this video and I think it's cool, quit the app because I want ro record it by my screen recorder but suddenly it continues to play the video but I already remove it from the recent apps. Then I tried to open the app again and it wouldn't open after that I deleted it. Load wasted.. ð¡ð¡ð¡"
This game is unplayable in 1-12 I tried to beat the level for a half an hour an the controls made it impossible it was so bad that for the last ten minutes it wouldn't let me get passed the first jump. After that the game just stopped working. Fix the game.
Broken Game Controls dont function properly. Very simple concept but the software can't distinguish between an up swipe and a down swipe. More than half the time after starting a sprint the jump swipe turns into a slow down and you die.
"The jump tumble at stage 1-2 doesn't activate because the trick input is tied to the jump input, and that the player is airborne when passing the activation point. This makes me unimaginably angry."
"i loved the game as soon as i downloaded it. i played it for the first time after downloading, and it worked well though getting through the menu screen was time consuming. and now i'm greeted with nothing but a black screen on my second try. why??"
"Do not download this game. It is just a headache and frustrating. music sucks, gameplay is not interesting, and controls are touchy, I kept trying to speed up and instead you jump. not worth the space on my phone."
"TERRIBLE ""FREE"" game.. I played very little of phone games from BILLIARDS to CALL OF DUTY MOBILE.. and this is by FAR the WORST game I ever played BILLIARDS IS MORE FUN THAN THIS .. swipe registration sucks I'm CLEARLY SWIPING to the right and I slide down .. NOT only that one of the levels on ""1"" is incomplete CANT SEE what's coming next because there's no F****** checkpoint .. dont waste your time .. UNINSTALL SAVE YOUR SPACE"
"Hunter mode is too hard, impossible to finish. Also it doesn't allow me to watch videos to gain coins, I think there's a bug."
It is so frustrating! I try to jump or slide across a desk and instead I wants to slide on the ground and then your done. 1 mistake and u have to restart the hole level don't download
After getting a add i just uninstall it adds kind a irritating
won't let me pick up the skills when I swipe correctly. Controls are terrible. don't waste you time just to get frustrated by this.
"It is ve th bad. This game doesn't want me to play it. After it finishes its first part, it mists goes back to the play store again. I tried a lot to make it open in any way ,but it failed every time I tried. I really hate this game a lot."
"The story line is fine, but the controls are actual garbage. If they fixed this MAJOR issue I'd re review and give a solid 5 stars. I really want this to be a good game but the controls are just terrible. Not trying to sound mean but just reviewing what I'm seeing."
"The touch calibration needs work, played it for 10 minutes and was having a hard time with basic controls on 1st level. Graphics are cool."
"Worst controls ever!! Please fix the controls, when I'm trying to run it's sliding and when I'm trying to jump from a run it suddenly stops... PLEASE FIX IT!"
"This game is ð© frustrating u jump at the right moment to perform a trick but nothing happens and sometimes start the game immediately after some minutes game says ""Vector has stopped"" so ð¤¬in ð  n pliz add more levels only Classic mode n Hunter mode coke up more levels am done wit both modes n am reachin point of ""UNINSTALLING"" it ð (PEACE bru me out)."
I think the game is bad. I think they need to improve on the controls and or change them. It was very hard to jump to get the tricks/skills. And very hard to control
"Glitchy...the tricks rarely happen, yyou swipe u p to a truck and instead of doing the trick it jumps up. Swipe up is used for jumping up and doing trick which causes problem while playing game. Wont recommend"
The game is so far good untill the controls get worst! I would love to buy the whole game if the controls get better or if u just add other toggle option for controls.
I hate it I keep on trying to swipe and every time I do it doesn't work. I just keep on getting a head ack I'm going to give this game a second chance but if you don't fix this and actually make the swipe faster then I'm unstalling the game.
"I hate this game, every time i move or control the character, it does not work, if i swipe up to jump, it slides, the controls dont get it right, and it was so hard getting those box thingies by doing some jumps or whatever. I hate this."
After you reach story 3 you can't complete it faster the server it self get hanged and if you try to control. The controls also get Miscontrol.
"The Guard's reach is unfair. The controls are difficult. And the guy who said about that you need coins to get tricks was right. Would not recommend this game if your finger's agility sucks, just like mine."
Game play is exciting but Hunter catches you within seconds though you are in your best speed. Controlling is not genuine. The tricks we have are not useful because of lack of controlling.
The game ran entirely in slow motion. The controls are unresponsive and the slow speed of the game does not set the tone of fast laced parkour that the game advertises.
Very bad vector i cannot move 1-4 level forward very bad ð¡ð¡ð¡
"WORST GAME EVER!!! The controls are unresponsive. Half of the time, if it does respond, it does not do what you have set out to do. There are not enough levels and needs a major update to sort out the bugs. Hate this game. ð ð¤"
"I like the game but when I tried level 1-9 the enemy just electrocute me when I'm far away, it doesn't make sense! And also when I swipe up sometimes It won't jump fix the jump control NOW!!!!"
I love this game but im giving it 1 star because this game desperately needs an update there are more glitches and things that shouldnt be in the game than I can even count like somtimes when you are running to jump you will for no reason just stop and die or all the time this happens I swipe up to jump and I slide the controls are just inverted somtimes for no reason please fix at least these problems and the ending of the game is the worst ending ever
"This game sucks. I can't even get pass level three. I swipe up to jump, you want to know what happens? I slide into an obstacle. And also the guard, or whatever, can taze me while doing a stunt. I would rate this -5 if I had the option. This game sucks.ð¡"
"The movement is just awful, timings have to be perfect to succeed, but this game isn't challenging, it's just a time sync designed to waste as much of your time as possible."
my experience was terrible. the controls are confusing and hardly ever work and there was no clear explaination on how to use the skills they give you.
"This game sucks, it's control's do not work, I deleted it after level 2, there's no checkpoint, there's no button to skip the tutorial, some times you try to jump but then it makes you slide, it's not the best parkour inspired game."
I thought it would be great like shadow fight 2 but when I installed it the controls are just bad. Like when I swipe up it does the opposite.I would like they change it.
"The controls are absolutely awful. I swiped up to jump, and my character slid to his death instead. This happened FIVE times on the same jump until I just closed and unistalled the app."
Ok really it's a fun game concept. But for real these mechanics are down right dumb. How you gonna have bonuses you can't get without getting caught? How you gonna make tricks so expensive but yet need a new one every level? Seriously I do parkour. This game needs alot of work. Y'all idiots for this one
"I'm sorry but the psychics suck, way to hard, almost had a panic attack playing this game because of how hard it is to just freaking run away from the hunter and do parkour at the same time. Literally this game almost killed me... I cried every time I played this game because every time u try to jump or slide it does something completely different. I just wanted to have fun. But thanks for your little effort In creating this game i had fun at first but this game needs an update."
"I got stuck on a map for hours because the controls are trash. If you can't even play the game without doing the most basic thing, then its bad."
Really boring. Nothing like Mirror's Edge. Only 1 sound used for jump and it gets really annoying. Music is annoying. Also basically a pay-to-win (single player) game.
I am not saying that the game is bad but most parts like when you are running away and the hunter is close to you you automatically die hi is in mid aor but you die and when the character stops on front of the objects and wait to die plus when you jump it doesn't jump but overall everything is good but not to say that you created the game bad its good but need to be fixed
"The graphics and music are great, the controls ruin it, it feels like moving thru molasses, which for a fast paced parkour game will fail you the level."
I think the game is great but it needs check points. If you mess up 1 thing you got to restart. I spent a hour on the 2 level
"Worse game i have ever played, the controls are the worst, when you try to do something it does the opposite and this has been annoying since I played the game."
I love the game but when I got to 3-1 and 3-2 in classic mode and 1-8 in hunter mode it keeps resetting it so I'll complete the levels with 3 stars but when I open the app again it says I haven't completed it with full stars it's done this a couple times now
The controls were very sensitive. When you jumped it sometimes made you slide. When you attempt to jump the controls sometimes cut out and it doesn't jump.
Game is nice but at times the controls aren't accurate n it gets boring because you will only get three stars wen u manage to get every coin or box these are limitations to the game as if being chased isn't enough the game is frustrating n hard for no reason ð
"no matter where i swipe it always does the opposite of what i want, the swipe controls are not accurate and it makes the game harder than it should be, FIX IT"
The controls are not upto the mark the swipes become jumps and slides and always irritates the one playing... easiest of the levels cannot be cleared due to this
"It's been two years and the app still doesn't work. It's so glitchy that it makes some games literally unplayable. The screen will glitch and you won't be able to move the camera around and you won't be able to fix it unless you leave the game and rejoin. Which means tycoons where you can't save (the majority of them) and games where you can't save in general are unplayable because no matter how careful i am not to glitch the screen, it'll happen eventually. So frustrating. I could go on."
"Roblox is pretty much unplayable for me. Very few games work for me, and after a while they either glitch out or crash. A lot of the time they'll freeze to the point where if I turn off my phone music will continue playing and I have to restart my phone entirely to get it to turn on. This only happens with roblox and my storage is full of space."
"There is a debilitating bug within this app which cause a CURSOR to randomly appear on screen while you are moving, which causes your character to suddenly stop. It is incredibly disruptive to the gameplay because it happens very often and at random times, and it completely ruins the experience. Roblox, please look into investigating this problem because as it stands, this game is completely unplayable."
"I have 2 main problems 1. Camera. Sometimes, when I'm playing, the camera gets all buggy and makes it so that I can't move it and justs zooms in and out. If I try to fix it, it freezes. 2. Cache. I can't play some games because of cache. It stays on the loading screen and I have to close the app Fix this or I'm uninstalling"
"Roblox genuinely is soo unfair to mobile user's bc we can't have access to a very black color of skin tone the closest thing we have is the kinda grey one,the joystick moves on it's own like for example you're almost at the end of ToH (Tower of Hell) then the joystick moves on its ownð¤, and the screen freeze's for no absolute reason. Btw ROBLOX NEEDS BETTER MODERATION."
"After the recent update, the performace for my chromebook has gotten worse. For example, after joining an experience my frames instantly drop; no matter how many models there are. Secondly, tabbing out would also make my game crash and so will the other tabs that are open. I hope that there is a quick fix for this as soon as possible."
"Right, so I will start off that I was playing this game today and my friends and I's avatars are now all noobs. We tried reseting and uninstalling the app and reinstalling but it didn't work. I don't know if this has happened to everyone but I do NOT like it. It is very glitchy when playing on a chromebook and my clothes on it keep going out of date and disappearing so I can't wear them again, this is disappointing because you are paying real money to get 'Robux' only for your stuff to disappear"
It's amazing. It's is a good game but the disconnecting is very annoying and how touchy the game and all of the I impossible jumps and levels need a easier way to control hate have to move every five seconds and change the angle and also having the shop in the way of where the controls are. The squid game is not fair people are getting shot and killed in the red light and green light game when there is a green light.
"Roblox is constantly kicking me out of games. I used to be able to play games with a few tabs open, now I can't play most games without crashing a few minutes in, and that's without anything else running on my chromebook. It simply doesn't work for me."
Look I love this game a lot but I just cant play it on a chromebook. I have read other reviews and other people have the same expeirence. I have an Acer chromebook and its a very new and good quality one but roblox is just not working. It constantly crashes and its super glitchy and takes forever to load. Plus the store wont even load properly so i cant change up my avatar at all. Plus for some reason I cant use my touch screen anymore?? I can use touch screen on every other app and i can use it
"I understand the graphics are poor, but some of the games, like Spider, are just too dark to navigate the game. Also, they're all about the $$$$. Instead of constantly trying to sell upgrades, how about letting the customer convert their game winnings to upgrades. Some of the violent games are clearly not suitable for kids, and that's their target audience. The help screens are worthless when trying to learn a new game. Also, Among US H&S, the Invisibility Skill is worthless. Still SUX. SUXxxxxx"
"i can't play on my laptop, for starters every game i go into it's not even going to load i spent 4 HOURS to see if it will load and it wouldn't,i also spent tons of money on this game and my account got deleted after 2 days!!!! Email me so i can get my money back!!!!! worst game to play... if i could give this a 0 star i would....."
"Ok so, for starters amazing game, letting the game be made by the people who play it was an absolutely brilliant idea. But it stopped working. I have uninstalled and re installed maybe 40 times and all that happens is it freezes on the white ""Roblox loading"" screen. And an idea of mine is why not read the reports."
"Absolutely trash, I don't know what happened but lately I can't even play the game. Everytime I try to launch games like tower of hell or any game at all it freezes for a bit, shows a black screen and then sends me back to the loading screen (even after 2 hours of waiting I'm still at the loading screen) I tried everything from clearing cache, to even restarting my phone just to get it to work but no matter what I do even if I go to another account it still just won't launch a game. 0/10"
I despise this game. It randomly logs you out. You enter your password and it makes you reset. None of your Roblox accounts are linked to the phone numbers or emails that you opened them under. I have spent so much time and money rebuying robux and new memberships for accounts that last only a few weeks. You can't reach anyone. I hate that I allowed my children to play this game. It's happened so much at this point it has to be designed this way to keep money coming in.
"The updating(pending)is slow, i hate when your screen moved while ur walking. Hate the screen when its not moving it just zooms in and out sometimes, and sometimes it dosent even move at all, well it does if u move. so annoying it tags the chat like im not cursing???? Stuff r expensive. Atleast lower the price, not everyone is soo rich to buy stuff."
"So basically I'm trying to get my account back but the email isn't sending. And I tried other emails and the code never went through. And I tried to log in on a different device but it always says ""username or password incorrect "" and I checked its all right. No typos or a missing letter."
"The game is laggy and I am unable to play some of the games because it always crashes!! And the updates are too much my phone barely has space because of the constant updates, the game takes too long to finish updating I hate that you HAVE to update it otherwise you won't be able to play at all why is this even a thing!? PLS FIX LAG AND PLEASE STOP WITH THE UPDATES"
"its not bad, but there are still tons upon tons of bugs tho. Like the camera bug. Sometime the camera just stop working and freezes. Its hard to explain with words, but the bug is STUPIDLY ANNOYING, like your cant even PLAY THE GAME! And there are more like when the thumbstick just gets stuck and you cant move it, like this game is impossible to play if you have a tiny crack on your screen."
The game constantly freezes constantly kicks us off constantly keep selling your having technical difficulties. The game can be fun without all the technical difficulties and glitches sometimes you can't even log on. No incentive to get a Game Pass on different games you can't move at all and you can move fast at all either. The games and the App are very laggy there are a lot of bug in the games and in the App. AND now the server keeps saying it's busy not a good sign for roblox
"The game continuously kicks me out to the Roblox loading screen all the time, even though my data is great, my phone has plenty of storage, and I've cleared the apps cache, it still continues to kick me out while I'm playing to the loading screen. It's been going on for over 2 months, and is getting heavily annoying. This has also been happening on my other devices so it's definitely not an issue with my phone itself either. 1 star rating till this gets fixed."
"This game got better on the update but one thing that didnt change the loading screen when joining a game it just stuck or crash and also when you have good teammates that is higher level it will say teleport failed and just say ""experience technical difficulties"" IT ALWAYS sometimes i get angry to it just ruining experience"
"First roblox was fine, but after a few months of having it, it started glitching. I was just trying to play with my friends, but my screen started flashing black. My controls were messed up, and I knew for sure it wasn't my phone because all my other apps were working. I've tried resetting my phone, reinstalling roblox, and logging in and out of my account, but none of them work."
"Really bad game and very glitchy, whenever I play on my computer it will pause and crash and it can't be closed. There's this glitch going around it's called ""pink screen glitch"" which is kinda sad for mobile players and they can't play because of it (including me). There's too many glitches / bug in this game I really hope you can fix it because we are not able to play the game if it has too many glitches."
"Awful, u reliable, laggy, dreadful experience. The app just crashes out of no where, or I apparently lose interest connection which I'm connected to, or something just goes wrong. Not smooth at all, so flawed beyond belief. Please put some work in to the experience and revamp the app, there's so many bugs and I'm constantly having to reset the app and my device isn't exactly low or medium spec. When I actually get to play a game for 5 minutes without a bug, it's great, when it wants to be."
"It's a great game but there's 1 problem I HATE SO MUCH it's just that everytime I play a game that runs pretty smoothly, the app just closes randomly, I'm just playing and the app closes, Fix it right now, I can't even play anymore, all the games I play just crash the app"
"constantly freezing, on hp chromebase, fairly new, everything works fine, fast, i put every single possible setting to lower graphics so it works smoothly, nothing has changed, i go and delete over half of everything on this device, nothing has changed, as a matter of fact im pretty sure its getting worse the more stuff i get rid of, when you put all this into prospective there should be no issues, but its just constantly freezing every 5 goddamn minutes, frustrating, on top of other lag issues."
"This game is great, but not when on CHROMEBOOK, as many of these reviews say it is truly unfair for people that only own a chromebook as it is impossible to play, for example: it crashes randomly, you cant scroll on a chromebook for some stupid reason, and also it is super annoying because the controls arent the same as on a normal computer, laptop etc.. oh and cant forget the SHIFTLOCK! super unfair, fix these problems please and let chromebook users go on the roblox website to play it on that."
"As many other players have said, it simply doesn't work on a chromebook. I've tried all the troubleshooting tips I could find to no avail. All I get is an error message ""cannot connect to server, please check your internet settings"", yet my internet is fine, all other apps work, chromebook is connected to internet. I dont know if this is some kind of compatibility issue or what. All the family's other android devices work fine with it. Very disappointing"
This game suck I used to load it back in but now. I don't cause if you're on xbox You can't add people at all. Not to mention if you forget your email or password on your account for that xbox. You Are screwed and it's sad because I'm one of those people but wish there There was a way you could Have a chance to Log in on your roblox account. If you have. A xbox if you log in Instead of your password and email or try to add friends on xbox
It's not fair how pc is so much different compared to this.. the game crashes a lot and it ruins your game experience...Also it's very laggy to the point where the music in game sounds distorted! And then it crashes.. please because this is not fair.. This is very frustrating... not everyone can afford a pc you know... I just wanna have an amazing experience with this game..ðððâ¹ï¸ and also yall gotta chill with making everything cost robux
This game is awesome but when I was playing little ones I saw my hair was missing and then when I tried to put it back on it didn't pop up I left came back didn't work restarted my phone didn't work. I hate this so plz fix it it is very frustrating ð¥ºð¥ðð
"My experience on this platform has been awful, pls put money into trying to fix the game instead of other pointless things that we don't need. The game is buggy, the screen glitches all the time, sometimes the app doesn't load properly at all and most of the games are unplayable because either A the game is really laggy or B the game just straight up crashes on you. The only thing I'd say this app is good for is for texting Roblox players and posting in the forums. And that's just sad!!"
My experience with the VC is great I could connect my Bluetooth to it but ever since they added a feature where it's in-game setting it broke all my thing I can't even find a way to connect it back even YouTube doesn't help at all PLEASE for the love of ROBLOXIA. Turn it back like the way it is.
"I can't even get past the loading stage on my laptop. It will tell me that ""unable to contant server. please check your internet connection!"" but then in the background of that message you see the app load up the login page but the message is still there and you have strong wifi. It is just fustrating when you see it is working but it won't let you get past that message. I am on a chromebook and I never had any problems with any other app except this one."
"The game is glitchy beyond belief. It is hit & miss if you can get in a room, sometimes you can other times you can't and get error codes instead. It's annoying especially when you throw money at creating a character only to find... you can't get on-line. I check my Internet connections but Roblox does all this crazy stuff that frustrates the heck out of you. It would be a great platform IF they word sort out these grave errors. Why play a game that is fraught with glitches, errors. Not fun"
"It's a great app. It has tons of simulators but, one thing dissapointing about Roblox is that it has way too many system errors. Furthermore, these errors are not easy to fix by users. One of the errors I encountered is the ""incorrect password or username"" even though it is the correct password and username. I hope the developers fix this problem. Thank you"
"1 update ago if my chromebook got overttaxed it would crash, basicly making it so you crash every 5 min. Now I can't even open roblox, i have to unnistall, reinstall so it takes me to the login page then from there i can open Roblox and play some games but the second u close it it ca't load and I have to unninstall. Roblox is no longer for chromebooks, u will have issue after issue. If u can load it in then chances are your mobile cotrols will be so small it will be unuseable."
"Not mobile friendly. You can easily break the camera(this bug has been in mobile for as long as I can remember, never bothered to fix it) Optimization is really bad. Hacking players are everywhere. Where does the revenue they get even go, if not to improve the game at all! Limited settings. No resolution setting. You can say that making a game, managing, bug fixing and etc,. is hard, but it's another thing if said issue has been plaguing players and I for a very very long time."
"Roblox is a really fun game but there's too many updates, leading me to uninstall and reinstall but when I do that it just gets stuck on ""pending"" and I just just logged into my chrome but it was still pending. If it cant fixed I'm going to stop playing Roblox untill it's fixed. So please fixed this so I can have fun."
"awful, u problem, deadful experience game crashes out of nowhere while lagging (you can easily stuck the camera) and you making more updates per month (day), and if updating when i enter while updating, it says conection error, but my internet is fine if i find any more games, it cant see the picture. if i use this app a while ago, it wont work. if i stuck the camera, now i have to restart the game. bugs are a lie. thank you."
"This game on mobile: Fine This game on computer: Great This game on chromebook: the worst game experience that I have ever had. I hope this gets fixed, but all this game ever does is crash repeatedly for no reason. It is absolutely unplayable, for so many reasons that I cannot even put in this word count. If you are on your phone, try it. If you are on a chromebook, never come back here ever again."
"Everything costs robux and when you did get robux everything that costs robux is like super expensive. You can't even reture a gift card and roblox only updates so often it is like the same old thing there are so many errors when I am just trying to play a game it will be like, Error 34 You are curretly on another accout when I am CLEARLY NOT ON ANOTHER ACCOUNT this led me to quitting roblox. So roblox if you want people to keep playing your game then I sudjust that you twek it! Have a great day"
"This game isn't even good, first of all, the experience on Chromebooks are extremely bad, it caused my Chromebook to freeze at, I couldn't leave the game for a while or close Roblox after that. Second of all, now I cannot play it if it's on 32 bits mode? I seriously cannot play the game anymore because of this. And last of all, there is things you can do on mobile but not on Chromebooks but there is things on Chromebooks that cannot be done on mobile. If I could I would say 0 stars."
"This is a great game until a long time ago, it just glitched out and it made the game unplayable. I just want to play around with my friends and have fun, but it's not even playable and this glitch still hasn't been fixed and I've just been waiting for a very long time for it to get fixed so please fix this glitch and I'll change my rating"
"I've been a player since 2019, i really like the game so much. There is a little problem on the game. When i play, it actually kinda lags and like, the game freezed (the time when you type something and it doesn't and send every one is freezed)(and it happens all the time. Well, sometimes, i suppose.). I don't know how to explain it, but i hope you understand this, Roblox. Please, it has so many updates and it still isn't fixed. I hooe you can fix this problem asap(i like your game though!)."
"Absolutely horrible performance in the ui of the app even though the game itself runs great. the menus are the most slow, jittery, and unresponsive I've ever seen it is extremely difficult to even select games to play, even though most of the games themselves run great the menus are horribly optimized"
"Some games I can't play even though I want to enjoy them, Not to mention that alot of the games you are able to play on mobile you can't even play on xbox. It is very dissapointing. If they,made it where xbox players could play all the games that would be way better than how the status of xbox roblox is like. Don't get me wrong I like the game but if I can play a game on mobile but not xbox they need to fix it as soon as possible. Very dissapointing."
"Id like to report a ""Pink screen"" issue. Mobile players including me have been playing roblox for the past few weeks, after a few minutes to seconds, even once you join the screen is pink or starts bugging out. Frantically moving, or splitting the screen in half, sometimes not even loading the game properly. PLEASE fox this issue ð."
I'm trying to log in and when I do it's like normal but then the top of the screen is white and the bottom is black and the log in/sign up page is still visible after deleting the mobile app and reinstalling it plenty of times and restarting and shutting down my phone it fixed itself when a verification thing popped up and I was good for a bit but yesterday when I saw my avatar was black and a noob I deleted the app and reinstalled it thinking it would fix but the same thing is happening again.
"The game is good, but since the computer update yesterday, I keep getting kicked with error 268 ""kicked due to unexpected client behavior"" and weird errors on my phone where certain parts of the app will glitch or lose function Or it just won't realize I'm connected to the internet Update; support no longer working, and my first ticket didn't even get an auto response Also, opening from the website doesn't work either"
"everytime I try to enter a server it will only take me back to the main page or an endless loading page that will stuck. I have tried refreshing the app and even my phone but sometimes it still stuck. Usually,after like 10 tries, I could finally join the server but then again in the server out of nowhere it'll took me back to homepage and that's just straight up annoyingðI actually love this game before but now not so much anymore."
"I literally hate this app so much. On mobile it's extremely hard to connect to the games that's in the app, and it's just really annoying. I've tried to play a game, for example murderers vs sheriffs, and it won't load me into the game at all. It's either someone is in my account, or this game is just complete garbage."
It's a good game but it lags a lot most of the time doesn't let me play the games I want to kicks me out randomly when I'm not doing anything voice makes me reconnect for no reason anytime I'm in danger I immediately lag or just get kicked out will not kicked out but I always need to randomly reconnect for no reason and it's the worst thing I was creating a t shirt wasn't for sell but it still banned me a really bad game
We picked a one star because this app is really bad at loading properly so that way we can NOT play the game. Your app is really bad. I think that this app should get shut down also because of its horror games. It's really inappropriot for kids under the age of 12. You really need to get better ideas. And be considerate of miners/or young people. I think that you should get some better ideas considering the fact that most of them are inappropriate for little kids. I hope you remember this. Bye
"A lot of bugs, today I can't login to my account on mobile or even PC .The lag freezing didn't let me enjoy the game, when I enter an experience and exit it my device start crushing and shows UI system is not responding and sometimes it crashes when I open Roblox . Please FIX THAT"
Ever since the step verification randomly popped on my account I haven't been able to get it off. I have turned off email but its still there when I try to log into different devices. It is incredibly annoying and useless. I never wanted this 2 step thing and now its stuck and I cant get it's off. How the hell do I fix it
I've been playing this game for years I used to love it. But now it's way too laggy it's has an extreme lag that makes the game unplayable. And you can get a really ANNOYING IT CAN DISCONNECT YOU MOST OF THE TIME FOR NO REASON ð¡. (My Wi-Fi is perfectly fine but I keep I keep getting disconnected. I've been playing a game for so long on Roblox and I had hard progress on but then my progress disappear) ð I wouldn't recommend playing this game if you're on mobile it's way too laggy
it's a really good game but most times it's not like for me I needed a new Roblox account .So I went to my old account but the dice challenge came up . If it's different for you kk but NEVER DO WHAT I DID. I really like the games and there's no adds really good!! not about bugssss
"i love this game a lot, i play it every day! i just have one small issue though. i havent been recieving any of your newer and cooler updates, like AT ALL! its been an issue for the past 4 months, and i dont know if its just where i live or if its my device just acting up. if its not in my area (i live in a very small town in the united states by the way!), then i really hope you can get that fixed for me! :))"
"please stop breaking your game with awful updates, i cant even play it on my pc now because of some byfron security stuff i cant wrap my head around, even if it isnt this i've tried everything else that's within reason to get it back on. it just refuses to load in. what's the point of this app on the PC version if you have a website anyways? you've broken my version and i cant fix it."
"Theres a glitch everytime you run and when you open menu the game glitches the camera and there is no way to fix it, its been 3 years fix it and there is a problem with the joystick fix that."
"The recent updates to the game haven't been anything good and they keep adding on more restrictions. For example, I bought 2, $10 gift cards from Walmart and I can't redeem them because of the new region lock even though I made my account in the same country. Plus they removed changing regions. Essentially, I spent $20 just to get nothing. I understand that they want to add new things but this is outright horrible how people will now lose money because of a stupid update put out by the company."
This game is good but there is a lot of problems I try to play a game but it works a little bit and then it freezes then disconnected me and brought me back to the home screen and most of the games have this problem so is unplayable even if I have high internet please fix this I also face a mobile issue where the camera glitches and you can't move it you can only zoom in and out which is annoying as heck so fix the camera for phone
"I bought Robux for my kid and they took it back without informing any reason whatsoever but did not refund me the money. Roblox support doesn't reply. Google is unwilling to refund. Beware! Edit: I was refunded after this review. Star changed from 1 to 3, but review stays because they still haven't reached out to me to explain the missing robux. Edit 2: it happened again. Paid for robux, not delivered ð"
"The game is actually good if it weren't for the frequent lag spikes inside the game. My internet is actually good (did a speed test, played other online games without any problems with regard internet connection, and played videos online without the worry of loading it too much). Players in my screen tends to freeze most of the time and my ping even reached up to 7k+(update it rose up to 8k+) even though my internet speed is good. I really wanted this to be fixed ASAP. Update: it went up to 23k"
I like this app beacuse in one app we can play million of games. But there is a problem when I play game sometime game stucks for 2 minutes yes I can tolerate but not in battle royale games like bed wars. During fight it sticks and I dead. Please fix it ð
Updates provide speed and reliability how funny of that the fact that it crashes alot after i installed this update it is not even cool and oh boy the update this time brought alot more errors especially to my laptop it cant even run starscape withoutgetting error code 769 error code 279 and error code 529 side note its trying its to hard to crash alot and its been getting anoying in my laptop with the ammount of times i reinstalled it its still crashing AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD FIX YOUR GAME
"A buggy mess. the loading screen lingers blocking my viewing and having me stare at a blank screen. leaving unable to enjoy games since it disconnects me, and even fails to send me to different branch servers of a game. making the experience a horrible place"
"When my 2 step verification stopped working, I sent an email to roblox support asking for help, and that my account was not receiving images from roblox, I had roblox's 2 step verification email added as a contact, but it still didn't work. So I asked again explicitly saying that I was not receiving emails from roblox, so the person ""helping me"" told me to verify Ithat it is my account via email. So smart"
"Horrible robux page, Premium bug - everytime i try buying premium it says ""no thanks"" and ""manage"" i clicked ""no thanks"" and it says purchase canceled even though it took my money, it happened so many times I tried refunding and didnt get my money back."
"Screen Thing broke again. First game is fine you got the whole screen there the other few games are screen cut which is very annoying when you're focused on something and boom you suddenly zoom out and have to fix it. I'm so done with all these glitches that's been happening a lot, ruins the game experience."
"great game,overall that some people report you for no reason. and sometimes when i am playing a game it kicks me off or i am unable to move. and i think you should make it you can get roblox studio on chromebook instead of just windows or mac. if you can i didn't know that because when i type it in nothing shows up but some roblox games you can download to make robux (which doesn't work anyway)."
"I hate the lag, It makes the game harder to play, And make a cross hair because it's hard to move your fingers while your dodging, and another thing is the frame drop, it's really annoying because you can be playing really smooth but when you start to get sweaty in the game, the frame immediately drops to negative."
"Reporting and chat moderation. I don't even need to explain how bad they are. And you can't hear anything in the game if you use Bluetooth earbuds or headphones. Uninstalling and re-installing doesn't work. I haven't played since I got this issue, and I won't until it has been fixed."
"Game is great but full of hackers. When i wanted to log in and wrote my password it said something went wrong please try again later and also when i am trying to type the password it gives me a puzzle and says ""veryfying u r not a bot"" and many times it shows me a puzzle this is annoying and my password was correct but it shows incorrect... My account got deleted it's sad and there r some rude players that r bullying... Roblox is now not good... Fix this... Don't recommend to download."
"I liked this game so much but had to uninstall it due to some reason. Well, after a couple of months I decided to reinstall it, which I think, was the biggest mistake of my life. It isn't letting me logging in. I would've entered the username and password around 20 times in a row but still it shows 'incorrect password or username'. Like, this IS my actual password and username. I tried Uninstaller and then reinstalling it back but again I'm getting the same result. Please do something about it."
"Over all its a good game but there are issues like the clothes if it has a design on it some times the clothes are blurry (classic not new) and the camera when i move it, it only zooms in and out instead of left right up and down, another thing is sometimes i play a game for not even 1 minute and roblox crashes on my tablet frequently. ALSO i was banned for a day, for trying to defend myself and my friend from a person that decided to say to either me or my friend ""Stop talking goofy head"""
This game is good but when I'm playing a game it stops and like it say reconnect or leave the game when I leave it will literally log me out and I have to log back in Multiple times because it won't let me join I would not recommend but it's a good game but they always having glitches and problems with server and stuff this has happened multiple times I can't count it's annoying saying I don't have connection which clearly do have connection it's becoming to much and I'm getting annoyed really.
"This platform is slowly dying and has been for a long time now. I've been playing since 2012 I've seen many things come and go, I've flown on the old flying toilet glitch and I've played warrior cats rp games on here since my in game cat model was a bright blue marshmallow. I would not recommend this game platform to anyone, the players are completely toxic and unmanaged, many makers of the best games are genuinely terrible people, often even being gross around their young players"
This game is really fun and i would recommend this to a lot of people and like I started playing this game for like 2-3 years ago. And then i stop during the pandemic and then i started again in 2023 and then i got this issue when i open the game it started to freeze the whole GAME even my Phone started to freeze like i cant even move the button's of the game and my phone and it like just freeze and when i try to reinstall it it just freeze's again. And its really annoying and i hope it get fix
You need to add real rules descriptions of people doing in saying stuff that makes people don't want to play this game anymore I've been playing this game since 2010 There's a lot of bad contact with other players that are 6 it's a very good game but there's a lot of issues that make people mad and not want to play this app no more so I hope someone can see this and you could probably fix it cause really no one wants to play a game just being bulled all the time that all I hope you get this.
"I can't install it back and I've sent feedback twice I've tried to install it 8 times I can't install it again Edit - It won't let me update it now and I've tried twice. I hate how we have to delete apps just to upgrade this game. It's just annoying how they have to update so much and needing so much dmn space just to upgrade a small kids game.. It don't take all that, I wish I could make this a 0 stars and not 1. Multiple people have the same problems as me but they still don't fix anything."
"Idk what happened but the app won't even let me pass the verification part. Every time I put in my password to login it send me to a verification process and when I complete it, it will do it over and over and over again. Wouldn't even let me into the home page cause it's so glitchy..."
"Awful game. These updates don't improve anything. just create new problems. Previously it used to black-screen every 3 minutes then it kept freezing and now 1/3 of the game doesn't even load. I need to waste 3 minutes just staring at the loading screen of the game I'm joining. and when I'm in my player looks a ghost. Meanwhile, everyone else looks like a skinwalker or slenderman. Barely any optimization is done. Furthermore, you get banned for saying anything. I once got banned for saying sorry."
"To many bugs, glitches, laggy. This game would be MUCH better if all of these things was fixed. There's many more problems but there's too much. This game kicks me out the game out of the blue. It says I have no connection when it's full and there's many things wrong with this game that needs to be fixed."
"I really like this game but there is some problems. After playing for 5 minutes, the camera freezes or zoom in and zoom out. When I play KAT, My game lags even when there is a little players 5-7 players it still lags and after reporting an exploiter, nothing happens. Shame on you Roblox you never listen to those players who are begging for help."
"The update glitch it I can't play any of my recent games and can only join friends and if none are online I can't play anything and if I do manage to get into a game npc's and player's bodies are gone their head is the only thing there not even any accessories and my player model doesn't even move no running animation or jump, climb, or swim animation just a stone wall. And I can't go a minute without being disconnected from a game"
"The login isn't working the sign up isn't working and the ""verify"" legit is to hard. And it would at least be do able if it gave us more time but it doesn't. It hasn't happened to me but I've heard others say that they got logged and and lost their account because they legit could not get back in due to how hard the verify was."
"When I installed the app it didn't open, I was wondering why, and then I deleted the app and I installed it again and it wont let me log in to my account, please fix the bug or the problem of the app as soon as possible. Thank you for understanding. :)"
This app is bad last time I logged out of my account I couldn't log back into my account because of the security when they sented me the security code I copied it very closely and when I got back to the app I typed the exact number of the security code.When I got it correct it said there was an error.
"If I could put a zero-star rating, I would have put it.. this is absolute trash, why does people even like this gameð And also some of shirts ain't working. My wifi is fine but roblox just disconnects... UGH, I could either play some poor developed games than this... don't download this guys IT'S THE WORST, YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE WORST PART? THIS IS FULL OF DATERS,HACKERS YOU NAME IT! UGH. DON'T INSTALL THIS IT'S A MALWARE SOMEONE HACKED THE GAME, AND NOW IT'S CORRUPTED,"
"I hate this app and you better fix itwhen I tried to reset my password every time I tried to log in talking about security it's saying that it send a email, but it didn't I keep on clicking Vea send code, but it don't work!"
"I hate this game, mainly because 1 when I log out, I can't log back in 2 I was trying to change my email to my new one, and it will not let my play games anymore!ð¡ I am very disappointed in this game. It was the biggest waste of money and I'm not happy about this."
"It's a good game so I will put a 5 star if I was still playing it, but I can't because I got logged out again! I have so many accounts on roblox and its because I got logged automatically and it's because I can't remember my password to log back in. But this time it's even worse! So I changed my password on roblox so I would remembered it now and I still have it! I've been logging out of roblox, to see if my password would work, and it did! But this time when I tried logging it didn't work ð"
Please fix the bug i cant play a while when im doing something important in game i always disconnect but my wifi is good and our wifi is strong signals but i keep disconnecting if you dont fix this bug i will never play roblox
"Bro, this platform is super annoying I just spent $100 on robux that I couldn't even add to my account because of the""account location"" then I used another account which I put the money on to donate it to myself in ""pls donate"" it literally took 4,000 out of the 10k robux I bought leaving me with only 6k this is so annoying, how can I not get my full amount of money, this app is a total scam and I am very unpleased."
"This is the worst game I have played in life, in the literal sense, it is bad, it loads a lot, very, very, very heavy because of its loading, and it does not open quickly at all. I deleted it and hated it. ð¡ð¡ð¡"
"Roblox is an absolute nightmare. The platform is full of bugs and glitches, causing games to crash and players to lose progress constantly. The moderation is also terrible, with no real system in place to prevent inappropriate content or behavior from occurring. Children are often exposed to mature and graphic content, making it an unsafe environment for young users. The game's economy is also highly questionable."
"The app used to be amazing, filled with opportunity. Lately, its been very messy. I can't go 5 minutes without it glitching and then disconnecting me. I really liked this game, please work on it."
"It would be great if you could fix the major problems that have developed, the plane wants these items, when it arrives it wants something else. Adventure time, has lost its appeal because constantly having super hard levels, passing them and then having to redo them a few hours later. That's just shotty game play! I did contact support, wrote out what was up but now I'm only able to use your canned question to figure out what's up."
"It's fun for awhile with no ads but the storylines are dumb for the ""extra"" games, too hard in the cases where it's a ""hard"" level, and you don't make any progress. Recently I've noticed that there are glitches that keep the timers from progressing until you log in again, and it ""loses"" items that were previously there. It's been happening more and more so I'm moving on."
"Items go missing all the time. I have submitted several requests for help with this issue but apparently Township support has also gone missing. It stinks to spend so much time waiting for an item only to have it disappear when picked up. There are other glitches but this one is the most frustrating. I quickly quit making purchases in game. * response to developers: When it allows me to complete the automated answers, I have. Many times it takes you through an infinite loop then closes chat."
"This game leaves a lot to be desired. Kinda boring, with too many side quests, takes forever to do anything unless you spend ($$$). Never can get what you need to need to upgrade the barn. Puzzles remind me too much of Toonblast. I wind up spending maybe 3 mins and then forget about the game for almost a week. Probably, it could use a fresh overhaul. Realistically, I should find something different. Edit: it dead ends at level 10 unless you spend real money. ð Keep ya updated."
"HORRIBLE UPDATE!!! Regatta no longer has a icon in upper right side of screen or bottm for you to have a visual of what you have completed. You must click regatta to see if you have completed the task. The side puzzle games, once you win a puzzle it brings you to the game to remove more items. To get back to playing again, you waste 30 second while it loads. This wastes any special powers super you worked for fast. Side games are hussle and in order to advance you need a ton of cash."
"A great game ruined by greed. Long-time player who loved the game, spent money and gave it 5 stars for its variety, but it's no longer enjoyable. Everything that was fun and free has been removed and replaced with non-stop regattas and money grabs. No more mini-games you can win without cash like planes, fishing, cooking, even the gumballs. Now it's endless matching. Need a break from the regatta? Too bad! No more race of champions, which was more casual. Long-time players are leaving. Sad."
"You've made these side quests too difficult , like the renovations quest.( which makes it annoying and not worth playing). Gaining building supplies are way too slow (I've been trying to build several buildings and factories, taking days to complete it). The game feels like it would be fun if you spent a bunch of money. Enjoying thing seems to take a long time to complete and makes this game not very enjoyable. How does one reach out for this helpful info?"
"I've played this game for several years. I've bought Golden tickets, I've paid occasionally to pass a difficult level on the mini games, I buy game cash so that I can make the game more fun, but I'm done. This game is no longer fun at all. lt costs at least 10, if not 20, to beat every 3rd or 4th puzzle. I've done it repeatedly saying no more, but I mean it this time. You've lost a 5 to 20 dollar a month player today because of your greed. âï¸"
"Township would be a 4-5 star game except the Colorful Puzzle match 3 game is purposefully programmed with the worst targeting possible. Special pieces won't target the same block until a long delay passes, even when that block needs to be hit multiple times. They routinely target the least effective piece that can still meet the goal, unless the piece moves. Then it hits where it was and is useless. It's a blatant attempt to get you to spend money, and is extremely frustrating to play."
"Get rid of the puzzles! The puzzles are completely irrelevant to the game! You are forced to play the dumb puzzle games if you want bonuses. I even bought the golden ticket without knowing the rewards were based on the puzzles. This is supposed to be a town building game NOT a puzzle game. If I wanted to play a puzzle game, I would download a much better puzzle game"
This used to be a fun game. It was easier to get decorations and other stuff and now you just keep taking people's money and making it impossible to beat your cheating mini games unless you spend a small fortune. Your little deals you have are not deals!! They are too expensive!! Then you put the same decorations that I had years ago on there for sale!! What happened to the fun? I am tired of having one move left to beat the level and I have to pay for one more move. Bring back the fun!!
"Today I uninstalled and reinstalled the game. This game hasn't been working well recently. I can't follow my quest bcuz when I try and open the map everything freezes up. It also hasn't been saving my progress and today, I lost out on township cash and items found in the quest. PLEASE FIX these issues... Thanks! I'm over 1350 days straight play! However, it's been so frustrating I'm ready to uninstall permanently. I hope you can fix your game. ð 3/31...game froze after coming out of the mine."
Just too hard to play! Takes way too much time and materials and cost to put up a building or factory. Supposed to be fun not frustrating. Those side games drive me crazy! You can't win them without spending lots of money and they are super boring and take up too much time. Seems like you tie everything to them now. I've read lots of the reviews and most agree with me. There needs to be great improvement! And now you have went and changed the graphics again. Too cartoon like and wierd
"Makers keep changing things to make more money for themselves. A lot of ""bait and switch"" - for example, every once in a while (read: very rarely), the player is offered a 'purchasable' item at 90% off but when the item is purchased... oh sorry, there seems to be a ""problem"" in downloading the item. Oh but we do have the same item available at a much smaller discount, say 20% off (read: we're greedy and it will cost you more REAL money to buy the township dollars necessary to buy the item)."
"I have been playing Township for over 3 years. I usually enjoy it, but not lately. It freezes up and will not let me exit the ads to receive my reward. I have tried to contact in game support but it sends me to a chat with a bot, which suggests articles that do not help, then closes the conversation with no real help to resolve anything. Very frustrating. I also miss the regatta sidebar showing the current task progress to help stay focused on completing the task as well. I hope it returns soon!"
"I played this game about 4-5 years ago, and it was much better. The newest update actually made things worse. You can't see the time at the airport anymore. The first prize balloon of the day is no longer free, and the regatta task counter no longer appears on the main screen. Building the zoo is much more difficult, since the supplies needed to finish an enclosure is ridiculous. Zoo was better when we could sell excess products at the stands."
"I used to love this game, but now the mini games have become fiendishly difficult and take days of trying to win one. Then you get a couple of easy ones and then another hard one. And it's only ever the match three game, when there is a different one it's only for a day or two. They also removed the regatta counter on the side of the screen. On the whole, it's really infuriating lately and I wish they hadn't added these new updates."
"I have been playing this game for over five years. It used to be enjoyable with the mini games along with the calendar games (i.e.: Lunar event) and the regatta. There has been several updates in which the graphics are suppose to look realistic and they worse. The task counter on the scene has been removed, points received and the time for completing the task has been removed all information that is needed. I'm unable to participate in the calendar events. Game is sucking ð ð ð . Please fix it"
"This game sucks. Not for kids. The puzzle games are too difficult and can be frustrating. Even impossible at times (clear 40 items spread over the board with 10 moves, for instance). It's becoming a money grab, you'll get get stuck in a rut without shelling out a few bucks every so often. I would not recommend this game."
"The latest update has degraded the experience somewhat. Are you going to bring back the regatta task bar? I have to exit the task now and check into regatta to see progress, I don't like it. The swiping motion seems more unstable than before, please fix, thank you. Update, now the game is taking money away by itself, stop doing stupid things to the game. Will no longer recommend."
"Came to edit my review and will most likely be uninstallin, which kinda sucks after the couple of years..yes years, I've put into my town. USED to love the game, but like others mention, once all building/farm upgrades are done, you're pretty much done. The endless back to back events are getting to be redundant and I, too, miss the professor experiments to progress through the event. The endless puzzles are ridiculous! I didn't install a puzzle game..seems devs have gotten greedy. Disappointing"
"This is an ok game. Not for the occasional player, you have to keep on top of your factories and what you have/need. Little boring to me, but graphics are cute! Update, lots of issues with this game!! Game crashes A LOT!! Multiple messages sent in game to ""customer support"" WITH NO RESPONSE AT ALL!! I have figured out which ""side game"" seems to cause the issue, so when I see that one start I've taken to avoiding playing Township for several days until it ends."
"This game has turned into a money grab. The mini games go on forever and are impossible to finish. All of them are boring minus the match game which, you sneeze and it's over, and you are back to the cash grab again. There are no more cute decorations to purchase during a seasonal event, now you must use real money which I refuse to do. I find myself playing it...never."
"DEVELOPER EMAIL ISN'T MONITORED - BEWARE! This used to be an interesting game... addicting. But the last few updates have been puzzling. They replaced the wonderful graphics with cartoonish ones, on everything from crops to the people walking around the town and the buildings! With the latest update the animals became even more cartoonish. It's like they thought they hadn't made the game bad enough yet! They offer side games but it's almost always the same 2 games now."
"Addictive Game! I think what I enjoy most is the variety and having so many things to do. Love playing this game. UPDATE again and star change to 1: I have reached out for assistance and continue to get the runaround. For whatever reason, I am no longer able to participate in the regatta by playing the games (I can only do the tasks), and this is very frustrating. I click on the ""Go"" from the list... nothing happens. Click directly on the site... nothing happens."
"Changing my rating to 1 star. The matching games are impossible and obviously are pay to play. I have been stuck on the same level for days, so I haven't been playing the game as much. I play games to relax, but the matching in this game only makes me mad and anxious. This is a shame because I enjoyed the other aspects of the game. The matching game is impossible though and to get extra moves is $10...but you only get $1-2 for completing a big building. What sense does that make??????"
"I used to LOVE this game...so I keep going back to it hoping they fixed the problems, but it still runs slow, crashes, and takes up way too much space on my device. The graphics used to be great, and some of the buildings and other items had really beautiful details, but now those things have been made to look cartoony and ugly. I used to spend many happy hours playing this game, but everything I loved about it is gone now and I resent so much how it has changed."
It's been a month and can not upgrade my barn because the game stopped giving me paint cans I've been stuck on 14 trying to getting to 22. Very frustrating!! Is this game rigged to make it impossible?? I also have not had any of the mini games in the customer shopping lists for the helicopter for a long time either. I like them. Like little puzzles. I try to play every day but it becomes frustrating when you can't proceed without being able to update barn!!
"Fun... I like building the town, and helping others. I give it 2 stars because it keeps crashing on me. Especially with the regatta and advancing in the mine for the regatta race, keeps crashing!!! Now I dont care about the regatta race rewards! But the game is locked in a perpetual cycle of attempting to collect the rewards and then crash!!! I cleaned my phone out completely! I have space! This really sucks... changing to 1 star! Please fix it playrix"
"The side mini-games are a complete cash grab. I was spending township cash left and right just to make progress in the mine or to salvage the brick game, that was clearly set up to not give the player enough options WITHOUT buying power-ups or extending with more moves. You can't delete your session I guess, since I searched for that option and never found any help. So I uninstalled it and wish I'd never played to begin with... Waste of time and money."
"This game has gotten REALLY bad. I had been playing Township since 2018. I use to love it and all the different games. Yeah, I spent some money on buying dollars, because back then it was fun, now it just sucks. The games are gone, theres only one now. Its sucks up a lot of memory. Now, when I go into the app, Im missing about a quarter of my buildings. My stations have taken on the old look. It just takes way too long to upload and moves way too slow to play. Im moving over to Hay Day. See ya!"
"I used to Love this game. I've been a player for over 3 yrs and recently I have started to not play the game anymore due to the regatta changing, the same puzzle games that are hard to pass unless you spend money. There are no more fun games, no decorations, and the land expansion is only during updates. The creators got greedy and ruin a great thing."
"Over the last 5 years I have enjoyed playing Township. Over time it has developed into a game designed to cost money to advance. I get that they are in business to make money but they have made the puzzles key to advance they used to rotate the side games now all they offer are puzzles that you have to pay for moves to beat them... So not fun anymore! Also give the long term players something to spend our coins on, or stop giving them for ALL the rewards. I have 42 million coins don't need them!"
"l've had it with their ads with many sections. you have to keep pressing ""Next"" after long waits, and the ""Next"" and ""Finish"" buttons each take a long time to respond- all for one ad! The ads are in portrait mode while the game is in landscape mode. There's often no pictures or fun things to do while you wait- just a bunch of boring text to read. Its too annoying. I'm leaving this game because of the kind of ads they choose. Fun game, but not worth the stress its causing me."
"Everything was good until recently. The beach game is horrible, though. I thought it was a bug, but have since learned that is not true. REALLY? Level 2 is hard?! What a slap in the face. I actually spent in a little real money last match 2 competition, because it seemed winnable, and I did in fact compete it with some difficulty. I won't be spending even free in game money for this one. Way to turn off a long time player. Fix, or I won't spend a single dollar in the future."
"I have been playing for the last 4+ years. But the new Season Adventure's gets boring; those mini-games over and over again are incredibly boring, and of course, designed to buy tcash if we want to finish them. You took the fun out of the game. Never buy the Golden Ticket again. When the Professor's Experience (I think that was the name of the Season Adventure's before) started, we had to do factory, harvesting tasks, and helping each other; that was fun. But now it is a money pit game."
"Seriously with the update?! 2 wasted coupons. Can't you just do a confirm option if you want to use coupon??? You just made the change without a heads up and now we go to press the ask for help option and use a coupon. Seriously. Just a simple, ""Do you really want to use coupon?"" would fix it. Why are these changes so anti-intuitive? Taking it down to 1 star... the send button after the sticker button. the most important thing is the quantity in the barn - NOT time to produce. I want to go on!"
"Do NOT download! Been playing everyday for 6 years. Used to love it but it has turned into a money pit. It is impossible to complete events without spending real money. What's worse, events no longer require gameplay to complete, instead, you have to play the same 4 repetitive NOT FUN AT ALL mini games HUNDREDS of times just to maybe BARELY get through to the final prizes. This game has become a stressful money sucker. I'm deleting it now and it makes me very sad to see what it has become."
"This used to be a fun game. I have been playing for nearly 3 years now but for the last 3 months or so everytime a regatta is over my game crashes and I have to clear my cache,uninstall, and reinstall my game in order for it to work. They continue to charge for a golden ticket @ 4.99 but they cannot fix this problem. Also after a certain level you just do the same thing over and over again. You can't expand your town anymore... what a waste."
"The game used to be enjoyable, and the mini-games added to the fun; I didn't mind spending a bit here and there to improve my game experience. But the side quest event mini-games have become impossible to complete without spending significant amounts, which is such a turn off. The game has become frustrating, and no longer enjoyable. Guess the developers got greedy. Nope, not gonna spend any more on the game."
At first it's very interesting game. I love to design the town beautifully. But you make a game that won't let people have fun in it. Instead i wasted a lot of time to repeat the same stage over and over again. Why bother make a game which is so difficult to accomplish ?? Is paying money the only way to make it easier ??? Sorry your game is not worth it. Unistalled already.
"I've been playing this game for almost three years now, and I've recently discovered that the mini games are becoming way too difficult and unnecessarily hard to clear. What used to be a an avenue for peace and tranquility and fun, has been replaced with needless stress. Sometimes it takes me two weeks just to go past a level, hence why am starting to lose interest in the game. Update: The recent changes to the game proves that the developers are greedy and hell bent on sucking people dry."
Just decided to re-arrange the buildings. Big mistake. What an extremely troublesome task and horrible experience. I had to drag out each building from the storage and it was so difficult to do that too. Why can't the next building just pop up right after I've placed one? And I had to finish everything in order to get out too. Horrible horrible.
"Whatever y'all did on your last update, it ain't working and just simply ruined the game. Every thing was fine until y'all just decided to mess things up. Icons are now located in the middle of the screen. As a result, unable to harvest crops outside the navigation icons frame. Now lagging and/or latency. Y'all need to fix it asap."
"I have gone out of this game and went back in 4 times and my changes did not stick. Baking a bread and 3 in the queue, cleared crops, added sugar to make cubes... those changes were gone when going back in the game. This happened a few times last week and I thought I was taking crazy pills. I really enjoy this game, but what is the point if even a few, never mind many, plantings, factory work, etc., are randomly disappearing. I am on an Android tablet."
"I enjoy this game but I have had so many problems spending money on the app and purchases disappearing. I contact support and show screenshots of the purchases before and after and always get the same generic response and told that I am wrong. Maybe I was wrong once or twice but I know I'm not wrong for a 3rd time. It seems the customer service doesn't actually care to fix issues as long as they get your money, I even screenshot the before and after purchase and was disregarded."
I have 2 township and both have crossed the 4 year mark. Don't you give the 4 year avatar anymore? I would also like to say that more content to develop is appreciated. I would like to see a total overhaul of regatta items to get with my points. Since I have been playing for years I don't have doubles but quintet. A different concept of regatta tasks would also make it more interesting. Give players a reason to play game more than an hour a day. New non match 3 mini games would b nice 2.
This game would have to go through MAJOR restructuring to ever get more than a 1 star rating from me. Especially since I've found a City building game that FAR SURPASSES this one in ease of land expansion. And the side competitions on Township are a total waste of time. I definitely will NOT be spending another penny on this game.
"Started playing in 2019 and it was fun. Alot of different games like, bubble gum game, getting the trucks across the traffic, stuff like that. Then around 2022 they changed and it's just spending money on the them they have that changes each month ans it's the Same mini game the exploding puzzle candy crush type stuff. Those would be fine if they where just once in a while and rotated with the original games. It's a shame because when things change, they usually change for the worst."
"I did give 5 stars years ago. Since, with each update, it has gone downhill. The mini games are repetitive, with no more variety. The game commands are awkward: you can't see your task progress without changing screen, if you help fill a zoo crate, you need 2 commands to get back to your town. The events are more difficult to complete, and without buying the golden ticket, there is no way to progress. From 15 tasks per week, the regatta is now 15 tasks a day, which is ridiculous."
This game would be so much fun if you could actually play it more then 2 seconds at a time before you are out of energy. The side match game that you can earn more energy with are impossible to beat. You have to play it for days to finally win. You can not upgrade your barn enought to store enough products to fill all the orders with. So good concept but to frustrating to be as much fun as it could be!
"Fun game except for match 3 content and events as you get higher in level. It's not ""challenging"" to solve an impossible layout in 12 moves it's frustrating and annoying and takes way more than the 5 lives you get then have to wait, you have to get lucky which isn't a ""challenge"" as the developer response keeps saying."
"The commercial is misleading. The game you see in the commercial is limited inside the actual game you will be playingThe House of Luck popped up and I added it to my town for ""good luck."" I paid so many clovers, picked a chest, and won a prize. It has never appeared in my stuff. I have put in a ticket only to receive the standard email about reviewing it. It's a simple resolution, but it has not been resolved. Update they claim they didn't see a problem so there is a glitch in the game."
The matching mini games are extremely boring and way too hard to beat. I've used all of my power ups on much too difficult levels that don't get any easier to beat by the next round. I miss the variety of mini games we used to get like the cooking one instead of the same tedious tiles we get today.
"It's a good game .. though it is very addictive... Bcs of time limit on good to produce , aeroplanes to send and other. And also the yeti finding side game is showing black screen again and again which results in shutting down of the game .. and we hv to start it then again . It also has a very long intro ... I like the game but because of this problem l can't play it ... So please improve and see to this problem.."
"Okay game, pics in descrip are false-you don't solve puzzles. To progress quickly or solving mini games or to expand or upgrade or zoo expansion means spending cash, as trains doesn't bring enough materials. Skins or costumes can only be won and only if you buy a pass. Have to purchase factories or special items and then still spend more coins to build ...can you say ""Money scheme"". Glitches with progress being reset often. Lags, no fun events, updates break it. Giving it a try but soon remove."
"After 6 yrs of investment in this game (sure, some $) my rating has gone from a 5 to a 1. The last 2 years have been frustrating/sad: Obligations to spend money & use an enormous amount of resources, time & effort to participate with little and infrequest prizes & progress. Side games are pointless ... It was a really great app. So sad."
"Playing for 2 years now. I enjoyed it a lot at first but now some things are getting very annoying. Are developers even following the multiple gripes on Township FB groups? They ALL consist of the following lately: 1. Regatta is simply insane with 16 tasks a day. A complete money grab IMHO. I've opted out for weeks on end. 2. Developers keep removing important icons and buttons like the task icon button (top right) and now lately the home button (bottom left). No, we will not get used to it!"
Game freezes. When you harvest the plants you harvested dissapear. Its like they controlling the game for you to spend money. It has been 4 days that i need items on the train. I been getting the same items for 4 days now. I have snapshot of some days of the train for a couple of days. This app does not deserve any stars. I give it a fish it stinks
"I am having the worst experience ever with customer service. I had an issue with the app, for a long timeI couldn't purchase any credit. I beed advised by customer service to reinstall the game and try again. After a few attempts, nothing changed, and I requested a refund from Google Play. Now the game suspended my game because they this I have been ""cheating"". I have been playing for years, spending money and invested time, just to be kicked out, for the reason that it's not my fault!!!!!"
"Edit - issues have got worse and support is none existent now can't play the game at all as it won't load on my android phone or Chromebook. Love the game until it goes wrong. Been playing this for quite a while but since the last update the mini game is no longer giving tickets for levels completed, I've wasted about 10 levels of tickets that would of ment I finished the post office game. So disappointed. Evern worse now the new update has happened have to uninstall and reinstall to play."
"Initially the game was good, you produce things to complete contracts, fill trains, ets. Crops take longer and longer, not a big problem, the developers have made a gem matching game to play while you wait. And that's where theyr greed starts to show and shine. Very hard levels with very restricted moves. Almost impossible to beat without paying. Overall this is a pay to win gem matching game hidden as a farm/town management."
"WARNING! DO NOT LET YOUR PHONE DIE WHILE PLAYING! Yesterday, I had been playing the side game for about two hours, winning and receiving unlimited lives and power ups during that time. I also had won over 7000 tickets! The most I have ever won at one time. I had about 30 minutes of free lives play time left and was trying to make it to 10,000 before spending the tickets to renovate. But my cell phone battery died unexpectedly. I lost EVERYTHING! Unbelievable! I haven't played since."
I really love this game . But I hate the way it just stops and clear everything you just completed. Sometimes task that you just completed are gone and it looks like you never did them in the first place. And my God it freezes everything else on my phone . I really love this game but the developers can do a better job. Please. Then I will be sure to come back and change my review.
"Great game but please fix the bugs. Game keeps bombing out......frustrating. can't finish my tasks in time. South Africa Samsung tablet galaxy a Day 2 keeps bombing out if u collect your reward from the co-op race....I'll give it another day then I am Uninstalling since I can't even stay in the game let alone play.still doing the same,over 2 weeks now that I can't play. Is this going to be resolved or can I delete this game rather."
Iused to love playuy this game so much. But now for some reason I can't even see who's there in my co-op much less take part in regattas. It's so frustrating. I tried reinstalling the game (like a million times) and even restarting the game. That wouldn't even do anything. Can u atleast just reset the progress for me asap? And i tried contacting the support team but even that wasn't working Truly sad that i have to stop playing bcoz of this issue
"Updated 4/24: I had to delete my original review because I had to keep adding to it! Tech support is an absolute joke! The Regatta crashes my game EVERY. SINGLE. WEEK!!! - even when I don't participate in it!!! Update 4/25: I still can't get into my game to play, the Regatta keeps crashing it!!!! Why can't y'all fix that?!?! I guess I'll have to delete this game since I can't get in to play and can't get anyone to respond or help!"
"This game sucks as its best.. in the event where I was supposed to get 500 in game cash after completing the task, the progress of it was stopped in between and the level was changed to extreme hard so that even after spending some cash it will not be conpleted.. Pathetic way of stealing money from people.. Mini games progress is stuck or the even gets over in between.. Developers are sleeping.."
24 Apr. Same problem is back. Game is unplayable and crashes when the end of event pop up happens. 03 Sep. Same problem. Game still unplayable 30 Aug. Same problem as before. Unfortunately this game is now crashing when I try to collect end of event rewards. There's no way to exit out of collection
"The same mini games over and over and over even tho everyone is begging for new games. Every time u pass a level it goes back to the main screen, wasting time when u have unlimited something for 15 or 30 min. The only reason I stay is for my co-op friend. I will not be spending any more money on this game when the creators don't care to make players happy."
"This game's playability has become poor. I don't get my rewards like I should. When I load the train, I might have to reload the same train again. When I place goods in the factory, I might have to reload again knowing for sure I did. So annoying. I don't like it anymore"
Stupid game They waste your time waiting and everything you earn. They make you wait for days for upgrades and for hours for nonsense items. The waiting time increases as you level up. You need special tools to upgrade your barn and there is only one way to get them and they choose when and how many you receive. Instead of shortening the time waiting for expansions they increase it and they require more tools which you must wait for them to give to you. I have so many issues with this game.
Please bring back the Regatta task bar. It is so frustrating and stressful not being able to keep track of the task you are working on. Also you have taken away the checkmark on the Regatta building to show the task is completed. There is literally no way to keep track of Regatta tasks except going into the Regatta location. You have officially made the Regatta more of a pain to play than it's worth and you have taken the fun out of it.
"for over a week I haven't been getting the tickets for the mini game, I've been messaging customer support even sent a video of me winning the game & getting no tickets, their response is we'll look into it . I've uninstall it re installed, rebooted my device, sorry but I've had enough now I'm fed up with it. I won't be able to complete the postal room now because it hasn't given me my tickets. very disappointed ð"
"The game issues have gotten worse, and ""Help"" is an auto-generated circle jerk. Progress disappears all the time. I find myself logging out and logging back in to make sure what I just did actually stays. Plane cargo changes and mini games are a money grab. Golden ticket time frame keeps getting shorter. So frustrating"
I have been playing township for 3 years now.i used to love this game but now the mini games which is to find things in the jungle and the color matching game is getting really annoying because it's impossible to complete those tasks and these games are going on for like 15 days in a row which is also very irritating because nobody wants to play one single game for a long time. And for that reason township is getting a boring game. I think new games should be introduced for shorter time.
"New updates ruined it. You can't tell if you've finished a regatta task. The side puzzles are more stacked against the player. Tasks require too many building supplies for how slowly they replenish. Too many new additions require spending real money. This game was always a cash grab, but now it's even more blatant. It's no fun anymore."
"Every game you've got with hard and super hard levels will be boycotted by me. It's infuriating that I've got to play a game 3-4 times a day and EVERY day I can't beat a level, end up putting real money in, and STILL CAN'T BEAT THE LEVEL!!! I'm all for giving money, but this is STUPID. Shame on me! I'm not wasting money on you any longer. I've got other games to put money into."
"Haven't been able to play for 2 days. Game opens, the regatta notice pops up and then app closes immediately. Keeps bombing out. So frustrating. 21 Feb and I have had no response since my last review. The app keeps bugging out after every regatta. It takes me to claim my prize and then shuts down. I have not been able to do a thing for 4 days. Reinforces my decision not to spend any money on this game or to download other games by the same developer. Fix this or tell me what to do to fix it."
I like the game compared to the rest i've played but...... It takes too long to gather the materials/harvest/etc and game just started acting weird it was saying it needed to be updated but wouldn't. It wouldn't let me play without updating so I reinstalled it and my whole farm is gone! And it said with the newer version i would lose SOME stuff but it is completely gone.....
It is so glitchy. It shows me where my co op placed and then it completely shuts down. I can't even play the event games anymore. It keeps saying my device isn't compatible. I've been playing for more than a year and I've never had all these glitches before.
"Edit update: there is nothing wrong with my storage your game is slow on certain events.... I like the game and player base, only problem is the memory it's storage being so big that the game lags and slows down when I try to do the mini puzzle games it's frustrating keeps crashing. The recent update made it slower too."
"Something is suspicious. This is the 2nd time I completed the mine activity, with the message ""Congratulations you have completed the activity and won the grand prize"" (I'm paraphrasing). However, when I tried claiming the $200 prize, the icon states I did not finish in time. Once, maybe I was wrong the first time but a 2nd time (completed in one day), that seems suspicious/dishonest. Someone needs to respond to me & rectify this issue."
Apparently they don't want my money. Any time I try to enhance the game by paying for the golden ticket...or anything...it doesn't work. Also I had an account prior and I had to start from the beginning even after connecting to Facebook. Good to use when youre bored though.
Nicely balanced resource management game. Lovely graphics and style. Small mini games keep it varied. Not too pestering for purchases too. Update: accidentally reinstalled this as advert made it look like a different game. Should be illegal
This game used to be fun but at every turn they're finding ways to try and get you to spend real money for fake money. The mini games/events are rigged to get you to spend real cash. The so call treasure chest that you win be full of useless prizes. Let us win the fake money. Just money hungry. SMH I've spent too much and have nothing to really show for it. I'm done spending!
"Update*They don't tell you that they REDUCE the size of your barn at the ""end of event"" which is stealing because you pay to increase it with actual money. I'm not playing it anymore, which is disappointing because I enjoy it. But their greed is disgusting. So, I'm only giving it a 3 star because it's VERY expensive to play! I'm going to stop because it's a waste of a lot of money. It'd be nice if you didn't have to spend money on increasing your barn size every half hour!"
"Just getting started, is fun so far. Will update if needed. Well was great for a while but as I continued in the game I realized that I was being cheated out of rewards and when I brought it too support with photos for proffer I was told I was wrong and that I did receive the rewards I was supposed to. Play if you want it is an alright game I just wouldn't pay to play as you will not be getting your money's worth."
Excellent game and very addictive. Amazing enjoyment I'm really enjoying it BUT only the first 2 levels. U can't proceed without using ur credit card which means they r forcing u to buy or can't play on. This kind of game is where u need to give ur banking details etc. BIG WARNING! STAY AWAY. U WILL LOSE MONEY!!!
"Revised: CHANGED FROM 4 STARS TO 1 STAR-- Sure, it's free to play but it costs real $$ to advance. It starts out fun, you move along quickly, until level 50ish, then you must spend real $$ or its boring and will take forever to advance. Also, there are many glitches where you will not get the coins/rewards you have earned or your money will just disappear. Of course the devs blame you or claim they can't find a problem. Read the forums. Don't spend a lot of real $$. THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS!"
"Customer service Is horrible. Claims your problem doesn't exist. Emailed developer and it bounced. Forcing updates and participation. We have great people who help and like to be helped. Developers are very clever in that you get rewarded for helping in this game. I'd leave if I wasn't the leader of a group of great people. If anyone knows of a better, similar game with caring, active management and customer care, please let us know. So much potential so horribly managed, will be on long break."
"A very exiting and interesting game......till it started to go down hill. It is boring (the developers thought that is you have to produce 20-30 of an item it will be stimulating!) What to do with all the coins? I've got millions of it....you can't buy gems with coins, neither can you exchange it fot t/cash, you also can't help your friends with coins."
"I suspect their support are practicing to become politicians, don't actually address the issue or question, dance around it and say stupid things like ""we appreciate your feedback, our team works hard to ensure the game is fun for everyone"" Playing the same level over and over and over in the side games sure is fun!!! They also can't seem to figure out the difference between normal, hard, and super hard.... oh wait... I bet they can! Cash grab BS!!!"
Edit from my first review. The game was fun. Now it's impossible to play due to the updates. I've deleted everything possible and it won't work so I'm unable to play. I don't know what changed from it being my favorite game to way too hard to play to can't download the update. It's very sad. I'd like to talk to a tech person and get the game working again. Update 4-10-23 another update and I can't play the game again. Why these constant updates requiring more storage! You're ruining the game.
"Why are we held hostage to have to click through the dialogue of the dumb side game?? I dont like playing the side games and when there is a new one starting, you force us to have to start the event and click through all of the dumb dialogue. I am sick of that and do not want to do that! I refuse to click on this latest new event and your app doesnt allow to get around it. My last resort is to quit playing the game & delete this app. Stop holding us hostage!! It's stupid"
I'm playing this for more than a month. It is really annoying to see that the decoration things get doesn't work at all examples like the bridges. I brought the stone bridge and the vehicles doesn't come near by it. Hope the developers must work on it
"Support was beyond unhelpful. After my cash was forcibly spent, I asked for a refund, only to have the conversation closed and be directed to a page telling me to manually turn on money confirmation window... Instead of that being automatic... Gee I wonder why... Don't buy money for this game if you have fat fingers. I'll be deleting once I reach level 30 for tapjoy. If that's even possible. As you go up levels it's impossible to continue without waiting days or spending money (by force). Scam"
"[Edit: this is a ripoff game & C.S. could care less about tech issues~!] Township has a sub-game that is a match/mahjong type game that changes the tiles as you are about to select them. I've written to C.S. about it a few times and they have yet to fix it~! You have to spend Township bucks on this sub-game in order to advance & even after spending those bucks, the tiles still change."
I have been playing this game for years and now i am having trouble with it as i am loosing rank in the regata due to tasks that i do and they just fanish....example....i will send the ships out to one of the Isles for the next task while im completing one....just to go into my game again and find that the ships didnt go out at all. This is just one example and it is getting to my soul now because after all these years o expect this game to grow...not mess up. This is NOT GOOD....
"Events in the game are taking so much for loading...even after one play, they again getting loading... And its showing that ""Township is not responding"" in my Android... why it's happening...is it not compatible for Android?! The third one is why regatta tasks info is not showing on the screen of the game... everytime I have to go and check in the regatta icon... Please try to change it."
"This game crashes constantly!!! I've played it for the last 5 years or more, and it used to be something to pass time... But lately it's began crashing so much! Mainly after I purchase 5 additional moves to help me complete a level. So once you go back into the game, you've wasted money as it doesn't let you stay on that level that you just bought more moves to complete you go back to the beginning of it. Contacted customer support and they've not been any help!!!"
"It's still very much false advertising. It's just mostly puzzle games to earn coins and stars, so you can do tasks and rebuild a garden. They now put the mini games you see in advertisement, but that's not the main feature at all. In order to play those, you will need to play the boring puzzle games. I will uninstall. I already got similar games on my phone"
"I enjoyed this game and actually spent some money on it, as it's very hard to advance without doing so. However after a while, I got frustrated with the game randomly putting out a pop up window suggesting that you buy power ups with game coins. This pops up in the same space where you normally click to try the level again, so you think you're going to play again and instead you automatically hit something that takes 900 coins out of your bank. It's predatory and they won't change it."
"I saw hundreds of ads for this game showing a series of challenges where you move pins to get items from one place to another, but didn't download it because those games never look like the ads. Then I saw an ad that promised this one looks just like the ad, so I checked it out. Surprising twist ending: it's nothing like the ads. It's the world's most annoying butler helping you fix up a new property. Most of the mini games are the standard Candy Crush rip off variety. Don't bother."
"Giving it a one because of the false advertising and deception from the get-go. I downloaded the game because it advertised one game that looked interesting. The ad actually even stated that ""they wont trick you into downloading this game and give you another totally different game"". So I fell for it and tried it out. It turned out to be one of those candy crush type of games with very little real play time on the game I originally wanted to play. Just another pay to play game, wasting money."
"Take my advice. Do not spend a dime on buying anything in this game. The second you do, the developers make it harder to pass levels because they count on you wasting more money to do it. Proof is in the YouTube videos on how to pass levels. They all start out with more moves. Once you build any momentum they throw in a challenge (pink) level so you'll use up any coins you get. If they were smart, they'd stop and let us enjoy spending money on the mini games instead of making it too frustrating."
"They have continously been taking away things that make the levels easier to beat and gameplay more worthwhile over the past few years. The one chance levels used to also give 15 mins of unlimited bombs, the races were unlimited bombs instead of lives, and more! It's becoming so challenging to the point where I can barely beat the levels anymore. What's the point of unlimited lives if you still can't beat the level. It's very much a cash grab and I have to delete the game. Not worth it anymore"
"I deleted app. After playing for a day or so, the match 3 mini game became very difficult to beat due to very few moves allowed to beat the level. I play a lot of match 3 games, so I'm pretty good at it. You quickly use up all your lives and have to spend money to buy more. I don't spend money on these games just to beat a level. After being stuck at one level for 3 days, I deleted the game."
"I've seen a million ads for this game, including the most recent one that swears that it's exactly like the ads. Not like those other games that bait and switch you. Well, they absolutely bait and switch you. Every ad shows the pin pull type of game, and while that's a part of the game, it's a tiny part. Most of it is more like candy crush which isn't the same thing at all."
"Going back to 2 stars game slowed to almost a complete stop . Support almost non-existant. Changed to 1 star absolutely no help from ""support "" for ANY of the issues I'm having. Am going to Uninstaller and reinstall AGAIN!! to see if it gets back up to speed and allows me to go through all the moves, but this is really stupid. Tech support should be able to fix things a lot better than they do. That is if they're even trying to fix this issue."
"I really like this game, but support is useless. Been playing a long time, things have changed and not for the better. Been having problems with a severe lag on the weekends only, and they want me to send a video which I can't figure out how to do. Severe loss of things in the expedition, no pathway shown for the collection items so you waste a ton of energy. Took away the 2nd bomb in treasure hound. Are they trying to get us to stop playing?"
"EDIT: Too many unskippable animations and pop-ups. Ridiculous. The game is fun, and the stories are cute, but once you get to a certain point some of the levels are literally impossible. Not just difficultâ they don't give you productive moves. It's an underhanded technique to get you to spend $ on the game. It frustrates me because I DO already spend money on the game. Too much! I buy every golden ticket and will often buy packages or coins. And it's never enough to Playrix."
"It's a misleading game. It starts out great. Real fun. But then it throws you a curve ball and starts to suck. The missions are real fun and cool. The games to earn coins and starts are fun to. But,then you get to some levels and it's a setup.It's not beatable without spending money because they don't give you enough moves or help items like bombs. So,now I'm stuck. Not enough coins to continue when moves runout or to buy help items. I suggest you don't download this bogus game. It's a waste."
"I'm ready to get rid of this game. As other reviews have pointed out it's a money pit. I like a challenge but some of the levels are too hard to pass even with power ups and paying for extra moves. I don't mind spending some money on this game but it's been constant. I think the game is rigged. It used to be a challenging fun game. The developers like to say that all levels are passible without power ups or extra moves, and yes it probably is technically possible. It's an excuse they use."
This is the second time today that the game has froze in mid play and then when I try to start it again it has taken all my boosters!!! It's hard enough to win the damn things and then to have them taken away because y'all can't keep your damn game from freezing! *Edit* I love that even months later that it's still happening!!! Absolutely ridiculous!!
"When Playrix says all levels are beatable without boosters, it's not a lie. They fail to mention the very low success rate on super hard levels. There's no skill unless you've never played a match 3 game. If you're stuck on a level (happens frequently) it's a very boring game. I just had 2 hours of free lives and spent the entire time on the same level and didn't beat it. When you don't have free lives, you can spend weeks on the same level. They make money off frustration. I won't cave anymore."
"I have been a loyal player for 3+ years, and I am done. I spend money each month, I think I am the perfect example of customer Playrix wants to have, yet the degradation of bonuses is just too much. Prices stay the same, yet you get less and less benefit by beating levels, solving puzzles, etc. Today I see they reduced the benefit on Treasure Hound, after beating 3 levels you get 1 extra move instead of 3. Just one example of many. You lost a customer, goodbye!"
"Fun, for a little while. Very quickly though the puzzles become difficult. The real problem though is they use every psychological trick to get you addicted and spending money. To the point where when you are doing well, the FREE power ups are placed so they make puzzles more difficult. You can have fun for a while, just don't fall for the leader boards, and don't spend money."
"This game would've been awesome had the dev left out the side games. You can't accomplish any one job unless you play the ""collection"" game. I wonder why games with such great graphics always resort to side games. No one wants to have to do that just to progress. So sick of it. I would've added a spinning wheel where you get five free spins every 15 minutes to get at least 3 stars, no more than 5 in a 15 minute time period. It'd be more fun than having to match & collect colors. Had to delete."
Changing from 5 stars to 1 star! I'm very sad about this. I have played this game for years.. literally YEARS!!! I spend the money on the golden ticket every single time there's one to buy. And other things here and there throughout the game I try hard to win all the competitions. I played all day yesterday to win the dang apple competition.. won it and didn't get any of the rewards!! Nothing. Kind of bummed out. Probably going to divorce the game a delete it. That was pretty bogus!!
"I've played this game for more than 5 years and I've spent hundreds of dollars. I buy every seasonal event and i refuse to spend another penny on it due to the constant nerfing of our ability to beat levels. I'm getting sick and tired of constant reductions in the number of turns, in what you get from the chest, in events that are increasingly grindfests. and if things don't change, both myself and my spouse will stop playing."
"Really liked it a lot at first! But the levels get stupid and it's a whole scam to get you to spend a lot of money. It sucks you in then makes things harder and harder to make small progress whole constantly suggesting you pay to get more lives. Probably about to delete it, sadly, because initially I really liked it."
"This was a great game. I used to buy the seasonal upgrades every time. However, they have slowly reduced the rewards you get and increased difficulty level to where you can only passed if you use rewards. Who ever came in charge made it more about milking the player out of money than to enjoy the game."
"Just updated today on 1/2/23 and got the 30 minute unlimited game and every time I tried to press ""give up"" the game crashed about 3 or 4 times every time. I wasted time cuz it would crash and throw me out of the game. This needs to be fixed asap!!! I can't even play like this. Updating as of 6:30am on 1/2/23 the game is constantly crashing once you lose. Please fix this otherwise I'll have to uninstall."
Been playing for over 3 years. And now everything is about spending money. Every 3rd level is a challenge or super hard. So any free in game bonus you lose right away. Best to play and then leave for about 3 months the welcome back gifts make it worth playing for about a week then another 3 months off and back at it. Oh and make sure you Uninstall or no welcome back gift.
Fun game at first and it's lots of fun decorating the mansion and reading the story. But after a certain point you have to pay to play basically because the levels are impossible to beat. Like you have 10 moves to destroy 80 squares or to collect 60 cherries and 50 yellow blocks. I spent $50 in less than 4 days because it's impossible to win without buying extra moves especially on the difficult levels. Wouldn't recommend you play past level 30 at most.
"I've played this game before, and the ads are false, garden scapes is a game that is like candy crush, you match 3 or more and have a limited amount of turns to clear the stage, doing so allows you to unlock more of your garden and make it look really nice. Idk why they've moved to these fake ads and screen shots, but it was a decent game when I played it. I'm giving it 1 star because of the false ads."
"Changed from 3 stars to 1. I have been playing for 5 years and it keeps getting worse. Rewards for the challenge round are puny. Most of the rewards are puny. Still have to buy power ups if you want to have a chance at passing a level. Plus,a few months ago the game started running REALLY slowly. Contacted customer support. They told me to unistall the game, power off my phone, and reinstall the game. This will be about the 15th time that I have done it. Hoping it works this time. Doubt it."
"Only the first few levels were fun. Afterwards, you'll spend a lot of frustrating time and lives trying to complete the 3 match challenges which are very fast and don't give enough time to complete the objectives without spending additional money for boosters. Not worth it, IMO. Uninstalled the game. Don't recommend."
"I used to love this game, but now its impossible to progress without spending money which I have. I am on level 11716 (4 days now) and has taken all my boosters twice! Which is annoying since a hard level came after a challenging level which also took my boosters. So my review is negative i have never gotten a mini game, I think the challenge levels should be optional, and if not optional dont put hard levels after the dumb challenging levels it's a move from development to get you to buy."
"False advertising! I, too, came because of the idea of only playing the ""mini games"" per the advertisement. Before I selected the download, I read the reviews. Glad I did, I saved the hassle of downloading yet another lie. Change your advertising or change the game. If I wanted to play a knock-off candy crush, I would just download the original game."
"Not as advertised in the ads. Claims you can progress in the game without making purchases, but, in my experience so far, this is not accurate. Keep getting stuck on a level for days. What few coins I get disappear quickly because the cost to buy boosts is ridiculously high. And the option to watch a video to get coins has never worked! This would be a very fun game if some of these problems were fixed. I especially enjoy the garden design aspects, or would if I got to do more of it."
"Game can be fun. However, there seems to be multiple layouts for each level. And only one or two is a winner. Expext to spend days trying to complete one level. Odds are in the house's favor. It is the same for their sister game, Homescapes. Spending money is completely optional and not required. But without spending major bucks, you are at the ""board layout rotation"" mercy before getting a favorable layout. You will see this by level 27."
"Apparently Playrix's MO is to make a misleading ad that looks fun but is nothing like the actual game. I saw an ad for a game where a couple was lost in a cold landscape and you had to choose what to do to keep them safe; this game is completely different. As far as the ACTUAL game goes, it's just another match 3 game with a little twist. I wouldn't mind playing it if I could turn hints off. It takes away all the fun if it shows me what to do whenever I don't make a move for 5 seconds."
"There's some fun, but it's more frustrating than it's worth. The cost of the bonuses is out of balance to the level rewards, the game play is restrictive, and the level the game depends on being willing to buy lives or bonuses is not worth it. I don't want to waste time or money on this. Sadly, if it had resembled either the ads or the free online varients, I might have kept the game a bit longer. I liked the butler and the story."
false advertising. showed an ad of being able to choose between three choices to get out of a bad situation then when you download the game all it is is another game of matching three shapes. boo!!!!!!! there's way to many matching games out there. would be nice to switch it up where you could figure your way out of a life or death situation that was light and fun. not just war games.
"I played this game for years, I can assure you that it will never be what you saw in the ads. I used to love this game, found it charming, played it daily. Something changed. It got to the point where you couldn't progress without money, there isn't an option to turn off the aggravating hints, the game constantly asks if you want to buy an item, a life, more coins, buy to continue, buy a safe of coins, etc. Old players are disadvantaged- & there's not enough space to type everything you'll hate."
"I never write reviews but I am so annoyed that I felt I needed to rate this game. I used to enjoy Gardenscapes but it takes forever to accomplish the most mundane of tasks. The difficulty of each level is getting harder and the ridiculous number of stars to finish tasks is totally demotivating. They just want you to pay for boosters. Even with free boosters, it can take me days to beat a level. What's the point? I want to see progress."
"It would have been nice if the game was actually like the ad. Instead, it's just another matching game with intermittent pauses to listen to the butler talk on the phone. 30 minutes is too long to wait for a new life and some levels are too complicated. I like a challenge but not ""mission impossible "" every time. Especially when it takes 50 tries to get past a normal level and they only let you accumulate a max of 15 lives. On the plus side the graphics are great and the decorating is fun."
"Disappointing!!! I'm at level 9746 so obviously I have been playing for a while. There are no new levels which I am fine with and will wait for new ones; however, the repeat levels should not be as hard as they are. I can't even really enjoy the expeditions or the side challenged because of the levels I have to meet again. I believe I have made it this far and deserve tons of free stuff!!! Easy levels!! Where are they??? Especially bc I'm waiting for YOU to build more levels!! Thank you"
"I am not a fan. This is a frustrating game where passing the ""hard"" levels is nearly impossible. you need to purchase items with your own money, for instance, as you earn money it goes into a safe. but to access the money you must purchase the safe for $2.99. The items are not worth their value. even with the few power ups you get for $15, you still cannot pass many of the levels. save your frustrations."
"Absolutely ridiculous. It begins very fun and casual, but evertually the levels get frustratingly difficult. You'll lose all your coins trying to beat the level because it's impossible to do so with the amount of moves given, and the only way to get more coins without completing levels is to buy them. I have Homscapes as well and that game is the same way."
"The game is too hard. Takes forever to complete puzzles and takes too long to advance. Too many parts to completing tasks, ie: 1 star to make a phone call, 2 -3 stars to have the task done, then something breaks, another star for the phone call, 2 more stars to fix it, etc, etc, etc. Good if you have a lot of friends that play if not they just want your money."
"I saw different ads over and over for this app so I finally decided to try it. The gameplay depicted in the ads is no where in this game. I looked online for info hoping I was wrong. I didn't want another match 3 game; I was more interested in the logic aspect depicted in the ads. I was very disappointed in the very misleading false ad. It's truly amazing the lengths someone will go to try and convince you to try their product and give you something completely different, even if it is ""free""."
"Was very disappointed! ! I NEVER write reviews but I dont want people to waste their time and be disappointed the way I was. I had seen multiple ads of the misleading game. In the ad, I seen situations where you have to choose from 3 items to fix the situation. After downloading the game, it's nothing like the ad. Very misleading. I think if the game was as the ad shows, it would be a very fun and interesting game."
"A lot of the levels are impossible to win. No matter what moves are made, no way to win. Play for days not winning. Update: At level 2738, I think I have gotten pretty good at it, but I'm laid up and have been playing this level for 2 weeks several times a day, have used extra moves and all the power things several times. Game is diffently programmed to not allow you to win. Can't get past it so time to uninstall! Update, if I could rate it lower I would, There is a difference between random and"
"I not sure who told the developer that people enjoy playing ""hard"" and ""extra hard"" levels that you have repeat over & over & over again. It is so frustrating to have to play the same level 100 times or more before you can move forward (I've been playing for a while, and am at a high level) I continue on because I enjoy the fixing up the garden aspect of the game, but, honestly, I've reached the point where the frustration outweighs the enjoyment and i probably won't play much longer"
"I dismissed this game after two years of play, but they woo'd me back with gifts. It really is a fun and relaxing way to unwind, but getting stuck on a difficult level for three weeks, just causes anxiety. I'm on one of the troublesome levels right now, and I'm getting tired of losing. I may have to delete you again Gardenscapes?! Sorry! ð I am terribly sorry that I must delete this game from my apps. It is no longer fun. I've saved up points and powerups. Spent $1 - $10 for not."
"This game is nothing more than a money pit. After a certain level there is no way to beat the levels without multiple boost and even than it might take several tries before completing it. Other than the ""puzzles"" the game is great I just wish the was an actual way to play it. All the games like this are the same, they have great stories but unless your willing to shovel out cash there is no way to play."
"I have removed this game. Too many changes over the last year that have made it less fun and more frustrating, shake feature on bomb detonation, added back super hard levels, etc. It got to the point where I felt the main game goal was to get me to use all power - ups and have to buy my more to advance. There are a lot of match games out there, if it's not broke don't mess it up by continually adding things. Maybe concentrate on making good levels rather than just getting them out there."
False advertising! I downloaded this game due to the ads I kept seeing where you have to help the characters out of crazy situations with choices. That is nowhere in the game! I even kept playing and leveling up to see if it would unlock. It doesn't because it's nowhere in the game! I'm extremely disappointed and the creators should be held accountable for lying in their ads.
"The ""elevated blaster"" sucks. I purchased the 4.99 upgrade for this new event, and it is nearly impossible to get the rainbow blast in the game with it. It SUCKS. Total waste money. I don't care about 2 extra tickets if it is impossible to get the charge full. Whoever came up with the ""upgrade"" idea screwed us gameplayers. Big time. Don't even want to play now. Ready for the month to be up so it goes back to normal."
Horrible game!!!!!! They just want your money. I've tried one level countless times and I can't seem to beat It. I ran out of coins and items trying to beat it and now the only way for me to get an edge on it is to wait for my daily spin (and save items for days) or purchase items and coins. Well you set up the game so you have to spend money way to go. I will not be spending money!
Constantly makes moves I didn't do. Have to press the 'x' button 12 times for it to actually work. Repeatedly gives the same notification as if a 3 year old is playing. Always asks about facebook even though I have never and will never have one. Forces you to see the storyline. Doesn't allow you to use your unlimited life at a later time. Extremely annoying to have suggested moves constantly flashing. And when you want to exit the game it takes an entire 30 seconds to clear your screen.
"I used to love this game, but it's become increasingly frustrating. It almost always requires either coins, or boosters to pass levels, but I've put up with it. Until now. I'm fed up. The addition of multi-level games and ""challenge levels"" is an obvious ploy to strip players of boosters between the levels. Playrix has just gotten WAY TOO GREEDY. I understand you need to make money, but it's become ridiculous. I'm off to search for a new game. Which makes me sad. And angry."
"It got too hard after a while. People 2,000+ levels ahead of me are having no problems but it's taking me an average of 13-16 turns to beat each level which means I miss every bonus. It took me 54 trys for one level and it's not doing that to anybody else. Also, I get 6 less turns than other people (and I'm not talking about people getting bonus turns). The game is rigged. Pieces fall where they're not supposed to, no damaged when you use a bomb, cups won't show up when they're supposed to, etc."
"The game itself isn't necessarily bad, but there's a ""bait and switch"" issue since I got here via an advertisement. The same goes for ""Homescapes"". The advertisement shows characters or rooms needing help or repairs, and the player has to select the right item and apply it to the correct person, broken appliance, etc.; however, it's just a glorified match 3 game once downloaded. Disappointing."
"The little in-game (other games/fb) ads for this game or Homescapes... they all look easy and different. The ads are VERY misleading. In the ads, it shows an issue such as a broken sofa or cracked roof and the player (that's you) trying to fix the issue by choosing a hammer, or tape, or a wrench, etc... in the actual game, it's nothing but round after round of a Bejeweled knockoff. & Each time the rounds get harder and harder and it takes longer to complete each task. Misleading ads, bad game."
"Been stuck on level 37 for almost a week now and sick of it. The coin rewards for completing levels are so low that it makes it near impossible to buy any power ups or anything for that matter, and the fact that you have to BUY coins and there's no other way is ridiculous. At least make things more affordable in the game. The ad for the game are extremely misleading as well. Why not MAKE the game the way you ADVERTISE it? I believe the term im looking for is.... FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!! DELETED!"
"The ads for the game present an entirely different kind of minigame that you never get to play. You also only get one star per level, and the tasks are broken down into such tiny chunks that it takes forever to do nearly anything. I don't mind playing just for the heck of it, but between the lying ads and monotony I get bored easily."
"Coins and power ups are way too expensive. If a level is broken, for example the butterflies still won't come up with 5 moves left and plenty of ammo to destroy them if they decided to appear, then shouldn't we be reimbursed for the cost to continue? And all of the power ups lost by failing the level. I love and hate this game. It's cute how multiple bombs and TNT's drop only at the last move encouraging you to continue but not before it costs you to do so."
"NOT as advertised The game itself is a creatively done matching game. The difficulty curve is too steep for a casual game, and almost requires the use of purchased bonuses to progress after only a few days of play. Additional time investment doesn't help you, as it's level based. But the real reason for my low score is the game is NOTHING like the pop-up ads for it in other apps. There's no ""choose the right item to fix the problem"" component to this game at all. It's purely a matching game."
I kept seeing ads for this and all its variations. The ads make it seem like it's a choose your way out of situations by giving you multiple options below the scenario. I haven't seen that yet in the game. It's basically a variation of candy crush with story telling. My one star rating is for the misleading ad. Totally not the game I expected or wanted.
"I thought there were going to be a lot more of the puzzles shown in the advertisements for the game... didn't realize it was a whole lot of not that and very few (and short) puzzles. Still an ok game, but pretty disappointing at the same time. Some of the levels are pretty much impossible to beat, too.... seems they're just trying to get you to buy coins and stuff. Pretty disappointing there, too. Probably going to uninstall due to more disappointing than enjoyable"
"Lots of Negative Reviews & 1-Star Ratings: The ad for this game is fun, exciting and likely very challenging. I've seen the ad multiple times and decided to install. Within 2 mins, I uninstalled...not good. The typical match 3 game, and who knows how many levels you have to complete to get to the adventurous level in the ad. Strategic marketing, but very misleading."
"The game is not what is advertised. It's just a block swapping and matching game with a side quest of tedious side ""quests"" to advance the garden. There are no puzzles. Those falsely advertised puzzles were the only reason I downloaded and tried the game. The tile matching often requires good luck or boosters, all of which are expensive. There are minimal coins; it's very much a ""pay to play"", kind of game- not even ""pay to win"", just ""pay to play"""
"Having serious crashing issues with the game. I have been playing the game for several years, but the last few weeks I can't get in and play or anything it just crashes and kicks me off. It's a fantastic game but the crashing issue is riduciulous. You need to fix the issue. Up until now I have enjoyed playing the game and have spent lots of money upgrading."
"The game is cute, and the play is smooth, I play offline, so not bothered by ads. 1 star rating is because it's such a waste of time. No one should spend 3 weeks on one of these levels. When given a free hour of play you can guarantee that you will spend the entire hour on one level, so hardly a free hour of play. Just a free hour of ads for most I would guess when game decides to let you win, the whole screen fills up with ludicrous amt. Of bombs. So its TOO obvious that you've been locked out of winning until that point. All playrex games are the same in this aspect."
"Not at all like the advertisement on Facebook. The advertisement says it's choose your own adventure. To clarify, yes you can choose what garden thing to improve next, but no it's not like the advertisement where you have to select different tools or options to survive a situation. It's a matching game and you get points to complete tasks."
"Games this frustrating just aren't worth it. What they advertise and the most interesting aspect are the mini games, which only happen at the beginning. They make the main part of the game virtually impossible to progress in without spending money. When you do spend money, glitches that happen at ""convenient"" times flush what you spent down the drain, making it even more frustrating. The game itself would be fun and worth it if it the investment of time and money spent on it actually paid off. Save yourself the hassle and do something fun. Many more options out there."
"I think my favorite part is that the ads are so misleading that even the pictures on the page for this game are false. It's a fun puzzle game I won't lie, but the difficulty just continually rises whether you're winning or not.... Again it's a fun game, but level progression is awful, and seems like it was honestly just designed to make you buy/spend coins"
"I downloaded this game because the ads lead you to believe this a unique ""stop the disaster"" game. In reality it is a puzzle game that you must pass the levels to continue the story. The levels were very hard and made the game unfun to play. I am not sure if you must reach a certain level before you actually have a chance to ""stop disasters"" (I made it up to level 40 something and never got to it), but I feel it is pretty much a bate and switch, falsely advertised game."
"THIS IS HORRIBLE! if i could give it 0 stars I WOULD. the ads are very misleading which was the reason i downloaded this game in the first place. in the ads, it is saying that you have the choice to save your character. the ad that sent me was the one where he was stuck in a well i was very exited because i used to think it was a boring, house maker with a budget. so, i tried the demo game ad and it was fun. it turns out that it is just another CANDY CRUSH GAME. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!"
"I've played this game for a very long time, even purchased quite a bit, but now, the levels are almost unbeatable. I get the fact that the higher the level the more hard it gets, but this is ridiculous. The normal levels are just as hard as the ""hard"" levels! Almost every level, without boosters or coins, you would have to play 20+ times. Even with a HOUR of unlimited lives I wouldnt be able to beat a normal level. No one wants to play a level 20+ times!"
"Something happened with the new year. Suddenly the game stopped loading. I don't want to uninstall and lose my progress in the game so I'm hoping it gets fixed soon. I'm on level 700 or so. The game wasn't what was advertised and the levels are often overly difficult, taking 20 or more tries to beat. That's why I gave the lower star rating. However, it's a little addictive, so I keep going. I don't Ike being at a standstill now that it won't even load. Update 1/19/2020- Still no response."
"Was great, but then I got to level 2656 and I only got 11 moves to finish the level. When I looked up the same exact level on Google, every video of that level shows 26 moves. I thought it needed an update, so I checked and it did. But after the update it's still 11 moves and it's impossible to complete in 11 moves, boosters don't help and I'm not paying to get more moves. The response given for the issue is like a generic response that doesn't address what actually is occurring."
"Falsely advertised as a puzzle game. You know that when a game can't show you what it's truly about, then it isn't worth downloading. The actual game gets repetitive after a while. Since you only get one star for completing every match level, it takes a long time to even do one task. There are many tasks that I found to be useless, and it overall just made my experience frustrating."
"FALSE ADVERTISING WARNING!! Both this game and its sister game ""Homescapes"" have ads that lead one to believe the game is a puzzle/strategy game where you solve elaborate traps to save the man in the thumbnail image. This is completely false, considering the game is actually a match 3 with the different stages disguised as the next task to build or fix whatever the ""story"" of the game needs you to fix to progress to the next thing.. Unless it's the game you want to play don't waste your time!"
"Total waste of time!!! Levels are beyond passable unless you spend mega amounts of money! Its designed for failure unless you line their pockets!! I'm all for spending money on APs if its reasonable, but this AP is excessive and greedy!! Don't waste your time getting sucked in to the easy first round, it goes down hill fast, real fast!! It is also nothing like the advertisement for the game. None of the games are that type of challenge. Just same over and over, so misleading! Zero stars!"
"I gave this game 1 star because it isn't anything like how they advertised it. In the advertisments it makes the game look like a fun multiple option game. But really it is a rip off of candy crush. Also some of the levels are impossible to beat and it cost 3 stars just to do one thing! Also it cost 900 coins for extra lives ( They only give you 5) which it is impossible to get that many coins. I suggest that before you consider getting the game, you should read the critical reviews."
"it takes a very long time to pass a level, even if the level is not indicated as ""hard"" the level can take many tries to beat. when i say tries i mean hours or days. the game is not enjoyable if cant get to experience the levels it has. Been playing 2 devices and thats only because the second time i downloaded was because of false advertisement of it being an optional type game. i have been playing this game for 2 years and have yet to explore the entire 3rd part of the garden. OVER RATED."
Playing this game gets tiring. I like aspects of it but some of the boards are next to impossible to complete. I play when I get a chance on breaks so it becomes not so much a challenge but more of a frustration. The game often has glitches that almost always work against the player. That makes it not so fun. Playing for now but not sure how much longer I will be playing when other games offer challenges and aren't frustrating like this one. Thanks for not helping with your reply. 1* now
the fact that it costs 900 or more coins for boosters is a bit ridiculous. The side tasks are a bit redundant &a waste of my time. You need to pass 4 levels to hang a bell? seriously? I'm at about level 2700 & have put too much $$ into the game. The game really needs to be revamped because at this point it's no longer fun just frustrating. The game is greedy that it wants you to pay but gives an extremely low payout ie. 50 coins for passing a level that cost you 4000 to pass. A little help here?
"This was my favorite game. I play it so much that I frequently run out of levels. However, after upgrading to a Pixel 7 Pro, it no longer works. The game gets stuck in full screen mode, not allowing you to exit. Even worse, it causes the home screen on the device to reset frequently, erasing all your shortcuts and widgets. It is definitely too buggy to play now."
"Was fun at the beginning. I loved the choices you had when it came to decorating the different scenes. The higher in levels, the more stars are spent on ""calling"" someone, or ""ordering"" parts. Also, the decorations seem to be pre-programmed. Out of 150 stars used to decorate, I may be given options on 1 or 2 items. Most flowers aren't even choices anymore. Would love to do more customizing. Not spending any more time playin until that is an option on 99% of the items, like in the beginning."
"I saw this game a lot and thought it would be fun. I downloaded it and played to for a bit. I could not get past the levels, it does not tell you how many moves there are left so you run out quickly, and if you buy more moves it gives you 3 one time and 5 another. I have tried to get 1 star at least to get the the next level and I have not been able to pass the very easy level. So I uninstalled the game. was really disappointed with it."
"Not as advertised. It's just a version of Candy Crush. You never get to figure out issues like the ads say. I played for a couple of hours and never got anything but making the garden nice, by playing games. Seems wrong to advertise a game with the ability to fix problems and or escape issues, then all you do is play a version of a more popular 3 alike game."
"I was doing so well until I reached level 57, I've been working on this level for 2 months now. I'm not sure if it is a glitch, but too many moments I dont touch the screen and some of the objects move on me. kinda frustrating, I have been playing homescapes for the same amount of time, and have no issues like this. thinking of just giving up and deleting the game all together. especially if I purchased extra items to help me beat the level, and it did me no good. truly a waist of my money."
"The advertisment for this game is very misleading. It's still the same match 3 game that gets more difficult, and nearly impossible to beat levels without buying boosters. I stopped playing it, and Homescapes because it was ridiculously hard to beat a level. Getting stuck on a level for a couple of days is one thing. Getting stuck for days, or even weeks, is ridiculous."
"UPDATE- uninstalling. Played this game for a long time, but have decided it may be time to stop wasting my time. It has all the features in a simple game to keep you playing, but too many times of getting stuck on the same level for days, using all my power ups combined trying to pass these challenging levels to no avail. Then the competition is close to ending or is about to end, no power ups left, or coins to purchase them, and all of a sudden, I beat the level with a lot of moves left over."
This game glitches at the most inconvenient times. In the middle of a challenge the game would just stop working. Once it allows you to play again the only way to catch up is to spend money. Super sketchy shame on the developers. .. update I deleted the game today at 4397. The game load time is super slow. The constant pop ups about events that you have to waste time watching before you can skip and the schemes to spend money became too much. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone
"The levels need work, everything else is awesome. But once you get in a hard level, forget it. You'll be playing it over and over, sometimes for whole days until suddenly all the stars just align and boom, magically you will easily beat a hard level, no rhyme or reason to it. For starters, the amount of turns is ridiculously low and if the game decides that you are not going to win, then it doesnt matter how you play it, you are absolutely not winning."
This game would be fun if all the levels weren't all the same difficulty. I have used all my boosters and coins and have been stuck on a level for days at a time. It seems impossible to get past a single level without coins and boosters and it's not fair or fun. Just frustrating. I like the fixing the garden part but once I'm out of stars then what
Not even close to what was advertised in the playable ad. I thought it'd be a game where you progress a character based on choices and each has a different outcome. This only happens as a bonus to completing a virtual chore. I don't want to be a virtual maintenance man. I can do that in real life. Overall I'd say it's extremely tedious and not worth the data usage
"Not a puzzle game. The ads for it show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT game and give no indication or even hint at the type of gameplay to expect. DO NOT BE FOOLED. This is candy crush with an annoying storyline. Not a single puzzle or brain teaser to be found, just mindless 3-swap boards over and over. Was bored to tears but stuck with it for a few hours hoping something interesting would unlock. Learn from my mistake and do not waste your time. It's not worth the 30 seconds it will take to download."
"Great until the near impossible ""pink levels"" were introduced. It is one thing to have hard levels that take a while to beat....(that keeps the game interesting and challenging), but to introduce 1 chance to beat pink levels that you will lose 99% of the time (and lose all of your earned extras while your at it) is incredibly annoying. Annoying enough to uninstall. The irony is I actually spent money on the game prior to this change and now I just refuse to spend more and in turn, play way less."
"Exactly the same as others have said. False advertisement, I downloaded the game for the challenge of using specific tools to fix or clean up a room. And as others have said, there a certain levels that keep coming back during the progression that are extremely difficult that I feel are meant to get you to buy boosters."
"Unless you spend $$$ to get power ups, you'll eventually but the point where you have none and can't go any further. It's nice to play a game without incessant ads all over the place, but you can definitely see that they get their income from those who buy the power items. I cannot get past level 97 without using them and I have been out. I've tried the level at least 25 times and I don't get the slightest bit close. It's too bad otherwise. Uninstalling..."
"The ad for this game had puzzles, where you would have to move rods in a specific way as to save a guy. After downloading I find it's just another bejeweled type game. Maybe there's something like the ad in there but I thought I'd be trying to complete challenging puzzles. Not move the flowers to get 3 or more to clear the level and earn stars. Real bait and switch game. I uninstalled it after 5 minutes."
The game you play is not what's shown! It looks like you choose an item to solve a problem (like stuck on an island and they are getting hot so you choose a glass of water or an umbrella). It's just a match 3 game... and even that sucks! Don't fall for it... they set it up so you lose and spend real money to buy upgrades!
"The game is broken and it's been abandoned by the developer. It hasn't been updated in over 2 years. The option to earn credits by watching ads so you can buy things in the game is broken. Every time I try it, the game just gets stuck with an ad that won't load and I can't get out of it. I have to restart the game. You need those credits to get anywhere in the game. Also the camera rotation constantly rotating the screen makes it impossible to aim half the time. Fix the game Pixelbite!"
"Hard to control and aim. View lags behind direction of travel. It says to shoot in bursts to avoid overheating weapon, but if you tap fire, it switches weapons. Since direction of travel and aim are the same, you cannot back up and shoot. No customization of the main character that I saw. Stuck in female form. No tutorial or explanation of what control options do."
"Changed to 1 star. I love the game since it does not force you to watch ads and the rewards per ads increases as you progress in the game, and I just recently tried the high pricing characters. Movements are all the same. The missions are repetitive and only increases difficulty per level. Maps are the same, only added with newer rooms to explore, making it bigger per level. Overall, I love it. Not bad, but not good. It needs more stuff to make it better. Still, a good game."
"Playing third-player mode is never that easy, especially for a game that makes you shoot enemies in a way that you should always be ready or just shoot everywhere you like. Graphics are trash, and every location seems same from each other. Like, you've done this place and in the next phase you encounter the same map. Just different in the enemy's position and strength. And why does it have to be such a perfectionist? Killing sprees that are almost impossible are always required. Improve, pls."
The game camera makes me dizzy and it just seems boring. Pretty much the same map over and over again with a different layout. It's impossible to get a kill streak that last long enough... I feel like I'm shooting enemies right in my face most of the time because the camera is either where I dont want it to be or zoomed in so close....
"I spent so much time playing through this game only to find the last mission is IMPOSSIBLE! No matter if you have the strongest weapon and armor, you won't be able to complete it. Let alone getting 3 stars. The time limit is too short! 4 minutes to clean such huge labyrinth area full of mutants with such STUPID CONTROL? Innacurate aiming system, micro-sized skill buttons, malfunction control bug will make you want to throw your phone. Unless you're ready to get frustrated, don't play this game."
"The ""controls"", if that's what you want to call them are almost non-existent. The turning & moving are very difficult. The map that you use to move through the building is dimmly lit, the inside of the building is very dark, and whatever the hell it is that attacks you is faster than I could react, aiming is almost impossible. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE, EXPERIENCED OR NOT. The devs got a lot of twerking to fix this game."
the shooting controls are awful. not sure if its on purpose to make it difficult. but it doesn't even make sense to go about it that way. just make the mobs harder or increase the quantity and have the controls smooth like every other Mobile game
"Graphics, effects and sounds are very good, but unfortunately gaming control and bad (meaning very very baaaaad) camera view are ruining whole experience. And also there is no real difference between floors/levels, they are more or less pretty same, that eliminates curiosity, mystery factor."
I don't know how they managed it but they somehow encapsulated everything bad about console gaming controls and mobile gaming controls into one game. Moving around and shooting is the worst I've ever played or seen in any modern game. please make it 1st person or a proper 3rd person experience or just scrap the whole game and look at where and how everything started going wrong.
The controls are utterly horrible. Trying to walk straight bhell no the screen keeps turning and I end up walking backwards. Trying to shoot and my character starts turning. Then the screen. And the worst of all is the cheap deaths. I can barely move and one hit will kill
"New Realme 5 user. Tried to open app once, but the buttons are all black without any words in it. Some options or buttons show words but in Chinese characters, I think. Please fix it, I've played this game before with my old phone. I wanna play it to this new phone. Will change my star rating for you once you fix it guys. Hope so.."
"The controls are completely unusable. You can't turn carefully, its either all or nothing. The movement and aim joysticks fight each other, and aim is pretty much impossible. Its too bad, because the game looked to have promise."
"It could be quite nice game,but awful controls ruins everything. Abilities panel is very uncomfortable and that idiotic weapon switch by taping anywhere is very annoing. It is acceptable on first missions,but later it sucks! Instead healing you switch weapon. And in last chapter in timed missions it is unacceptable. Fix this idiotic weapon switch with tap everywhere by taping on weapon icon and it will be playable at least..."
"Everything is good. Except camera. Camera control is the worst I've ever found. Fix the damn camera angle. You guys thought that making it like that would be badass, but noooo... We can't see/aim at anything because of the stupid camera movement. Give option to fix angle or make it 3rd person shooter kinda angle. Game will be much much better and I will change it to 5 stars."
"The leaderboard is not working after I logged in to my google play account. plz fix it. This game has kind of a story mode, not bad, but you will get bored after repeating and doing the same thing over and over again. This game would be much better if it has multiplayer online."
"The game was really fun and addictive until the timer stages. Killing 150+ monsters scattered across the stage map in just 3 mins is absolutely absurb. Even with full speed, best weapons, armors and dashing through enemies, you can't even finish a single timer stage!"
"Controls should be improved for this game to be playable. Especially on last 10 lvls, where you need to be very fast with everything. Power controls (heal, dmg boost etc.) do not respond well on touch."
"Leader boards always displaying 0 point and if disconnected from account, it's displaying points. Many time loadout don't saved to last used after restarting game. It's annoying me, fix please.. *1 just think devs ignoring this, after fixed i will change it."
Caaaraapy controls! CANT AIM WHILE MOVING Gun only shoots forward which means no strafing or side stepping.no scope mode either. No peeking around corners. Too sensitive if you have large hands/fingers youre either running flat out or dead still. You basically have to just run in circles like a madman and spray and pray. Visually okay but still thise controls not worth the time. Also oblique pov doesnt allow you to see/engage targets at any realistic distance.
"Argh didn't realise on download this was the same publisher as another game. Control interface is the same for all their games it seems, and an absolute nightmare. You can't see very far, and enemies appear off screen with no way to know what you're shooting at."
"Cannot finish the last one Bc there is never enough time to take out everything before it exploded. So how are you supposed to finish the game. And I have tried many times until I just gave Up. Bc I was just waisting my time. So I am very disappointed with the game NOW. And I love This game very much, until the very End! Where it screw's you over, and it takes a long time to get to the End Also. Just disappointed with the end game. And I can't finish the game. What a bummer and I truly love THIS"
"Amazing graphics! Sadly that is all, just eye candy. The shooting controls are horrible (tried several settings) and pretty much make it unplayable. Uninstalling now."
Game designers made it so you can't see very far ahead at all. It's a shooter w a near sighted protagonist. You're constantly being ambushed by monsters 10 paces ahead of you that are standing in plain sight. Ridiculous.
A waste of potential absolutely..almost turned me into a zombie mindlessly trying create fun out this game. I felt the feeling of addiction and got mentally disgusted by it. I stopped playing the game after the second level was so Grindy I wanted kill myself. My mental health was on the verge of sucidal. If I had brought myself to complete this game in the end I would have killed myself. Anyways space cowboys is better game even if it has Predatory tactics. This game will kill you stay away...
"The graphics are execellent .. but the controller are terrible .. How is it possible, when you shoot backwards the direction of your weapon also changes? Make the front point static when shooting, and this will be a perfect game"
Does the developers on this game even read the reviews of other players??? The angle is too high! I dont see where i'm going. if the developers want that angle then zoom out the camera! You are all so proud of the character design that you focus the screen on the 3rd person view? Hahaha pathetic
"I'm sure its a decent game; I just couldn't get used to the controls. Its difficult to aim and you can't tell or see where enemies are coming from without checking the censors. All these making you bump into the monsters, you'll be half-dead after killing them."
This is a straightforward bug hunt that's badly hindered by the locked point of view. Being unable to see more than 10 feet in front of you ruins the game.
You can't defend yourself cause when the thing is hitting you no bullets comes out and you dead you got no chance of nothing. Uninstalling this game out on my phone plus it don't even aim just go where it is made to aim and very crazy control is all over the place
Game is good you can play and end this game without paying single rupees controllers are awesome. But I give only 1 star because. why enemy attacks so wired this is disturbing this makes experience bad. Enemy run behind you badly and attacks this makes shooting experience stupid. But finally game is good. Most of the graphics.
Jacked up for controller support. Calibration is way off. Couldnt even get to the part of the game tat you actually play.
"Brilliant time waster, with simple levels and marginal rewards to upgrade weapons and armour. You can grind, buy credits or watch ads, which is very fair for a free game. The real winner is using it with an xbox controller when the gameplay is really slick. Well worth a try.. Edit: no longer installs on OnePlus Nord; files will not load."
"Boring. No weapon skills. Boring and dark surroundings and same goal, same objectives, same aliens every level and same everything! I even lost my progress on the last update."
Good game but viewing distance is too short. I can't see anything 2 meters beyond me. I can only see the enemy when it's very close to me.
I thought I would like the game but unfortunately I don't I didn't even make it pass the first floor the aliens are too fast and the character moves slowly the control of the character is too loose moves too quickly unnecessarily
"Game seems good, but controls are terrible, when trying to move/shoot at the same time my character keeps freezing up, can't move or shoot while mobs keep hitting me."
"Excellent graphics, worst controls ever. The character moves in circles, I couldn't aim at the creatures attacking me! Sorry, I star ð only."
"Looked good...bur after watcing about 30 ads for game-money, to get nice gear, I found our it ws a touch-screen-only game. My Chromebook uses a mouse. No-go. How disappointing."
"game is sick if you play without controller/pad. When i want to shoot the enemy, it does switching my weapon. Aim is not really precise with hands."
"The game is needed a lot of wirk, graphics and control are frusstrating. You can hardly finished a level without getting killed"
"Ok so far iv got to floor 8 and every floor is the same, same layout, same only 3 kind of creatures, same items in every floor. There is no thi g more to this game as so far 1 floor is the whole game. Could be a better game with differenteveks and monsters."
"its just some bugs, i cant start the game because of the bugs, its all just black i dont even know what to press. i wasted my time and data downloading this, pls fix it"
Useless. It's real tough after 30 levels. Wang the best gear doesn't help. You keep respawning yet you fail to complete a level.
The game is too big for my phone screen.. As if a bit of the right side of the game is completely cut off of the screen..
It doesn't wanna work.... It doesn't have a sound and when you start the game it glitches.. It only shows that monster image.....i hate it.
games impossible to play you cannot stay lined up on the attacking aliens every time you try and leave them of course you shoot somewhere else and you can only shoot while you're moving I don't understand that
"Gets boring after you realise that you are doing the same thing over and over and over again, there is bothing new to each stage, the same old nonsensical tasks over and over again."
I get to the start mission button...i push start and nothing happens. And loved playing this game. Disappointed I can't play anymore.
"Game look amazing, but controls is imposible, so hard for control and shoot, i have wish to play but because of controls i uninstal game."
"Gameplay/control sucks. Mentally Retarded Female can't even aim at the mutants. When aiming directly at the mutants, magically switches directions the instant you hit fire. like a moron."
You absolutely do not need file access permissions for anything legitimate. Every other game manages without even with gigs of size and hundred-megabyte updates.
This game would be really good if controls are good but unfortunately bad controls completely destroy this game.Auto aim would fix game as well.
"Played 5 minuts got bored. childish/cartoon graphics, Controls are super terrible the two thumb sticks is the stupidest idea ever...can't you just have (one) fire button?"
Very linear and gets extremely boring... same floors every stage not much difference.... would of given 5 stars but too boring...
The character keeps turning in a different direction when I fire making the game unplayable.
These games desperately need a shoot button for chromebook. They put all this effort into the game and it can't be palyed on a laptop.
Not liked the game because there was upgrade in enimies it was Like I'm playing again and again the same level just map was new. No new enemies no new rule i feel sleepy during playing this game
Worst Game everon Google Playstore. Don't Download it. Waste of Time and Mobile data. There is no ammo pack after You die. Even when You Restart or Respawn You are empty on ammo and there is no ammo buying option in the Store. Had to rate one star otherwise one cannot post their comment as the company policy says
Very difficult to aim. The controller's precision is terrible.
Unbelievable... camera view is very bad and controls are very difficult but the graphics is nice ... uninstalled
"Aiming style is ridiculous. No one can shoot properly i think, and that is irritating."
"No new content ever. Same three armor classes,levels,AI etc. Needs online multiplayer support."
"Idiotic game.You don't even have enough bullets or the guns don't fire,while the monsters are everywhere and are faster than your in game character."
"the controls are ridiculous it's impossible to aim at any target, and having to constantly reset the camera is stupid"
"The game fails to load after 2 days of having the application installed. Thus, I rate this game a 1 star due to not working properly."
"It's really good but the progress feels really slowed down to make you pay to advance, other than that it's great"
Too bad I can't give a zero star! Aiming is confusing and where are the health resources especially for the first two floors? Ah well another dud
The issue is the controller because its very sensitive to mobe the cursor. I hope this can be fixed
There is a big graphic issue with the game all I see is black. I don't understand why also with space Marshall 2
Too difficult.. Impossible to even shoot in a straight line. Can't even get past first enemy.
Godawful controls. This game is sickening. Hated the controls so much.
it shows only black screen it doesn't work please fix it.
"Cool graphics, gameplay and all but the controls ruin the whole experience I'm sure I'm not the only one who's complaining about this..."
The camera jolts too fast and there is no tutorial it is not worth your time the graphics are good but are wasted on this game
Shame. Run-and-gun not my thing. 5 minutes playing identical levels was enough. Not enough variety.
"Nothing at all, Just a game, no good story line, no good shooting, and every weapon is too similar, controls are too bad"
Its a great game but the only reason I'm giving it 1 star rating is there is no multiplayer mode and it dispointed me so much please give us a update with an multiplayer mode ðð»ðð»ðð»
The game seems nice but it has its issue. How you aim your weapon is beyond stupid that it's impossible to aim
"When i was installing this game, i thought it would be interesting, but it wasn't. Its just like pre school kids game. Please dont downkoad this game."
It has boring repetitive missions. There is no story to this game nor any hooks to keep you playing
I couldnt play it. The camera spins constantly and it gave me a headache almost immediately.
"It could do a whole lot better, if only the controls were more traditional type!"
Xenowerk is very cool and nice game. the graphics is HD is good and it have more level to buy new guns and suit in the game. Is the best shooting game ever!!!!!!
"The game starts you off with zero ammo. You have to pay for each shot. So for the tutorial, you'll need fifty dollars."
Unbelievably poor movement and shoot controls.uninstalled after 5mnts.great work developers.
What wrong with this game the joystick is stuck and I can't get to settings
the Control sucks for this game and I also think they should have a auto wing for this game if there was a auto aim this game would be playable and redeem
"Dear team Xenowerk, I made a payment of 690 INR to buy credits of 1,00,000. I didn't get the credits but the payment got deducted. Please respond and resolve this ASAP."
I almost good but the movement and shooting joystick is to small and it hard to move and shooting you ignorance fools and please understand your customer
"The controls are awful. The idea for them is good, but... The aiming is difficult. The main character moving really weird. The music is good. It easily can be a good game but it's not."
Game control is very horrible . that's why am uninstall this game in just 10 minutes after download this game ...but graphics and game play.. fabulous..ðð¼ðð
"I like the concept and the graphics, but it's too repetitive. It repeats over and over again."
Game is very very good but camera position is roast . Camera position in the only things that is making it a 1star game
"Very repetitive, the monsters are always the same, 0 satisfaction from the game in any sort of way"
The controller support needs work. Second stick isn't aiming properky.
View area and controls suck bug time. Makes game play poor.
Boring_grinding_repetitive missions_controls are bad (and i get that cause its a third person shooter with top down view!) but still it sucks!
i dint like this game their control and camer angle is so confusing and aimimg is to sensitive whenever i fire it change the fire direction in other way and i get killed by mutant ððððððð
should have given it a 5 star but after grinding for a month the game just crashes without a reason.all my time spent lost
"Your updated version kills the sound immediately after the stupid page pops up for earning extra gold. You can't stop that page from popping up immediately upon opening the game and once you close it the sound is gone. For me once the sound is gone the game is not fun and I don't want to play. It won't let me go back to the previous version soooo you've lost a long time fan until this is fixed properly. Not sure what else you may have messed up because I won't play without sound, period."
Word of warning. Do not get invested in this game. Yes it's fun at first. But the missions stops. Basically they use u to get money. I bought gold to unlock next level to upgrade my tech which was a lot But guess what!!! There is no more missions after South America!! . It shows your plane flying to Russia. But no more missions. It's all just challenges. No more story and they literally tell you they aren't making anymore to the story.
"I used to love this game! I never uHad this peoblem the first time but now !PLEASE! Fix the issue with the ad it pops up & then the sound just disappears, have tried closing the game & reopening but it pops up every time I open the game! Very Fustrating trying to kill zombies & you can't hear them. ðð"
This game is very rediculas ... If minus rating available I gave -5 rating..... Why I have to play many times to clear single stage and this third class game hang on same stage every time??.? This is very very cheap and rediculas game ..do not waste your time ... Game was good but in many stages I have to play many time to go to next stage... It's boring and rediculas..... Need to work on.. It's bug and need to fix it .. and it's hang may time.......
Wow I was so happy about the update I thought that the infinite loading screen was gone but I was wrong so I played the tournament for a blueprint I got two of them lucky for me but oh my gosh the screen was frozen and I was forced to reload the game when I came back I lost all of my progress.Now tell me when are you gonna fix it properly this time? please getting a blueprint is hard it really depends on luck
"The mission ended in South America. Incomplete game and has been like that for many years now. Same old levels once mission is complete. Plus, the developers must be racist. There's not a single person/zombie of colour in the entire game but it just so happens to be that the SMUGGLER has to be a black man. How original."
There is some bugs in the game .... Whenever I open the game suddenly there is pop-up message came regarding collect the gold by playing various games.... After that game sound totally disappear . It's like game without background sound. It's every annoying at some point of time.... I am playing with my new REDMI NOTE 12 PRO mobile
This glitch is driving me crazy when i get the shotgun all 4 blueprint in the game and when i am going back to hideout its loading forever and that is the glitch by the way the game has good graphic i have give two stars because for the good graphics but my mind says to give only one star because that's the least amount
"Played for a couple minutes and it froze. It took longer to load than I could play it. Tried again recently. They promised a reward if I give them my email log out, click on an email they sent to me and log back in. BS they sent no email. Fa Q."
Don't know why. But it crashes a lot after clearing one mission. Every mission i used to play twice to clear one mission and move forward...thats why i quite playing this one. hope u improve
"Downloaded the app and you still haven't fixed the no sound. Took the time to redo my review for your planning team. Your developers aren't doing anything. Too bad.ð Maybe next year. Till then ""Into the Dead 2"" gets all my attention."
"This is outrageous, I spent money on this game and now it stopped loading completely and doesn't respond. This Issue has been going on long enough. It's annoying and pointless. Waste of money and time, I've been playing dead trigger for years now and I understand it lagging on old phones but I Brought my device last month, it has more then the required specifications to run the games so it's sad to see a games that started off so well become unplayable after the first few levels"
Good game mechanics and gameplay but there are some super annoying elements to the game. The spam/pop up ads. The absurdly long wait times. Making me wait more than a day for an upgrade and I'll literally stop playing the game. The writing as well seems like it's authored by a 5 year old ð The tooltips cover the centre of the screen. Pricing for items are absurd. You can easily spend as much as an AAA game on a console just for a few guns.. Now game keeps crashing after a mission in loading.
"When I log into the game, my audio is on. After the free gold advertising pop up, my audio goes off by itself. I tried to go to settings but my sound was on but still no audio. Help plz."
"When i complete a mission it gets freezed in loading screen so i waited for it to load but the loading screen didn't changed so i restarted the game then the mission is still there, so after completing the mission ""again"" it still get stucked in loading screen then i restarted the game and completed the mission again finally the game loaded and opened the lobby AND this situation is repeated in other missions too sometimes it loads sometimes get stucked in loading screen."
The game is good but the main problem is that after every level the game HANGS and then i have to reload the game only to find out that the progress is gone and now i have to redo that level.. please fix this or else i'll have to uninstall it cause i don't wanna play every level twice or even more than that.
"I closed the pop-up after I enter the game & the game sound went mute. Please fix it, it's too scary without sound but I want to play this game. :'("
"Garbage. You don't actually play the game, you kind of move the character from green circle to green circle and the game plays itself. I haven't played mobile game for a while, but when did they get so bad?"
What the heck is problem in this game? ð¡ the loading screen which the gunsmiths diologue is shown is keep on freezing and i have to play the level again and again and again even if i refresh the screen ð¡ð¡ð¡i played level 4 five times and it made me crazy mad ð¡ð¡
The game is very good no doubt but the reason I'm giving one star is the game is not working properly it is stuck on one stage not going on.. so u have to close the game and play again and again the same stage..
Well I just finish one game then it start lagging when I'm done I can't go back to my world I'm stuck to the loading screen And then when I exit or exit by itself it make me want to retry the game again please fix this I might give you 5 stars if this is fixed
There are some bugs u need to fix 1. Sound 2. While connected with wireless Bluetooth in between there is some issue it goes on mute automatically please pull this ticket to ur support team Thank you
"Would be great, except the Tapjoy ad disables all sound completely upon entering the hideout, and it can't be turned back on."
"It freezes ca lot, I can't kill them but they can killed me. Can you do a fix, my tablet is fairly new and has great video .I do really like this game."
This very big bugs in this game . This is 99% hang and crash in andorid game there is one time in days and this game is very hang. This is very bad expereience and price is so high.... Remove all these problems and reply me
Having a really bad time on samsung galaxy a10e has an ad pop up then sound drops out till you restart the game then guess what...ad pops up sound drops out help me I want to like this game
The game is good but the when we go to Africa on 2 mission after completing it a loding screen appears and the game freezes there only
There is no missions in Tech 8. I am planning to uninstall. There is no blueprints . Waste of time and waste of money. Thank you
"Don't download this game. They make it look like there is 11 campaigns but after campaign 6, there is no more levels you can play. The majority of good guns and gear are never unlocked by campaign 6 and they haven't unlocked any campaigns in last 5 years. Story is cut off so you don't even have a conclusion to the game. Wish I had read the reviews before I started lol. Save your time, skip this game."
"There is a voice issue in this game. When I play this game I hear cracked voice which is irritating. It's not my device speaker problem because other games and apps are working well and I haven't downloaded this game from a third party site, so what is happening. Please fix it."
Game freezes after mission and this happens almost every other times i came back to play it after a long while and this persistent issue made me decide to uninstall this game. What a shame not being able to play such a wonderful fps zombie apocalypse game just because of post mission load freezes
"Well I don't know what happened to this game it used to be really good but now can't play at all ! I get a message saying it needs to download some data or something and that I should wait until I'm connected to WiFi Umm Hello I already am connected to WiFi in fact my phone is constantly connected to my own WiFi in my own home ð and pressing the ""begin/resume download"" button makes no difference so could this be fixed please because I can't play this game at all now and I really enjoying it"
This rating is temporary. The new tapjoy offers mute my game everytime I start it up so it's not a good thing. Fix it soon
"I scored 4 Stars when I started, but the app has serious issues after you get to level 37-40 /6-8 the daily jobs stop working and you get killed and it is impossible to beat . Daily job tasks for the arena of death do not work, and stay on your screen blocking your view. They are all about manipulating you to spend money. Warnings are written blocking your view. Do not spend money it only incourages them to slow your progress and hinder you more. The sound hasn't worked since I started."
The game is awesome but I am giving it 1 star because it freezes on loading screen when you complete a mission. Please get it fixed asap on update. I dont want to uninstall the game. I will give 5 stars if it get fixed.
"The gameplay is good, but it gets stuck between levels 90% of the time and forces you to kill the app and restart it again. So, you end up playing the same levels again and again. It's really frustrating."
I still can't play this game on my Moto E20. Always stuck at the loading screen right after finishing a mission.
"Why the people create a hype, plz don't do this, I have played many times, it is totally sucks,mostly time, gameplay is freezes."
The game never opened it kept saying account failed I tried everything nothing worked it was advertised to be offline but it requires me to use wifi
"After i complete a mission, it will take a long time to go to the base. This is a bug and i hope the developer could fix it. I love this game, but the bug make me dont want to plya this game"
"ð ye game hai. ekdam baklol game hai . chapter ""into the wall"" in africa region. i completed 8 times but the screen is getting frozen with no response ahead . Everytime i had to close the game and reopen. I thought there will be any update i missed but no update is there . The issue is only with this particular chapter , remaining were working fine. Uninstalled."
After successfully completing the level name scientific peek when the game redirect back to home page it just stuck and keep on loading.
Very slow... always waiting for next mission... Irritating...upgraded tech for new mission but showing nothing...poor game...
After completing a mission the game freezes in the loading screen which is really annoying. I tried so many ways to fix this problem but i couldn't. So please fix this issue ð­
First I loved this game and was addicted. But now I have noticed that After America there are no missions. I went up to Russia but there are no missions. Is this how it's made? I have updated tech to 6
This app is trash but cool at same time but when I complete a level every time it' doesn't load and sometimes it's loads
Fix your f-ing game it keeps freezing it pissing me off s good offline game and it crashes that really pisses me off.
If I could give it a zero I would. 500 mb to download and has nothing but audio issues. Ridiculous
Its a really good game but the HUGE annoying problem about it is that while ur in the middle of a mission or campaign missions it lags and u have to shut down the whole app several times before it starts acting normal
"I have completed all the mission till tech level 5, after upgrading to tech level 6 there are no new mission, if there are no mission in tech level 6 then what is the point of upgrading from level 5 to 6."
So the game developer doesn't know what OFFLINE means? ððððð. Why I need internet connection if the game description literally says offline game. If you not going to let me play the game offline why this game is in offline games section.
I got a new phone and it did not save my progress and I still have the account saved in play games but when I try to sign in it won't let me and on play games it still says I have all the achievements!!!!
This aged surprisingly poorly. Riddled with pop-up ads for in-game purchases.
"The game crash a lot , please fix it because it is realy joyfull game and worth my free time."
Please fix the sound problem and try to upgrade better. Thank you.
I have problems getting the app installed not sure if the app shutdown or the cause but I've already tried everything
Here they says its offline to. Duds but it's not a offline game. It must need a good internet connection.
Y'all really need to stop your false advertising. NOT AN OFFLINE GAME when YOU CAN'T LOGIN WITHOUT A DAMN INTERNET CONNECTION
It freezes each time I complete a misson pls fix this its wasting my time
I got tech 7 but .I always play 1 to 5 level where is 6 and 7 .it's missing I got bored for this game ...!
I hate the into the well mission because the rager in the level is so powerful if it hits you you're dead now like in the YouTube
To hell with the game... They say it's offline buh no it requires internet connection... And gun firing is automatic
"In the first 10 minutes i was playing the game, the screen freezed permanently 2 times"
In open house Misson i can't find trigger that sniper Mission so annoying game and controls deleting it right now and giving it zero star because you deserve it
"I need to login to my account because i've reset my tablet due to system upgrade but I forgotten my username, NOT password. Please help me to login. Thank you"
The ad for this game said this game was offline but it is not offline I tried it on the bus does not work don't recommend this game
The game is Showing its offline thats why i downloaded it.Now its showing internet connection faild my user id d3xt3r874 i hope you will fix this pbl.
There a pop up after few seconds of opening the the game then there is no sound
I finshed tech level 5 misson and update tech to level 6 but there is no misson in russian campaign it just empty
I give it a 1 because the loading screen is so long and it annoys me please fix it madfinger
So bad game!!!! There is goven in info that it is offline game but it requires lot of internet
"If there is a zero star i will give zero star, kindly shutdown your game. This game is trash and waste of time."
Stuck in African Companion lvl the big restoration after completing level when continue it stuck for ages then quit I Request MadFinger team to resolve it
Garbage game keeps lagging and not saving my progress.
I played the game about 5 years ago and decided to come back. It's now infested with annoying ads. As if the greedy freemium model ain't enough. I already know the stupidly long waiting time when you craft weapons and items. Deliberately punishing any remaining fans who're still playing this game. You guys didn't even bother fixing the bug that the game will be stuck on a loading screen if you played too long. Sheesh. You guys really went downhill and gone shittier throughout the years.
After completion of mission it taking so much time to take main menu
"Used to be Fuuuun! Now Zombies are Olympic Sprint Champs. They Spawn from Thin Air just in your Back but hey if you're fast enough you can even spot them doing so. Oh and to Add to the Anger your character Relodes his weapon each time he fires a Round!!!! Just Stupid Stuff, add a reload button guys ð¡"
Game is good but after finishing the mission the is stuck or freeze can't run always loading.. Please try to fix as soon as possible. Thank you
The game always freezes after completing the same mission so many times. Please fix this issue cus I am not able to progress forward:(
"""10"" regions, make the russians actually struggle in this war so they can give US missions!!!!! i was so excited and was supplying up on painkillers and grenades, just to find out that we cant live to see the end."
It's a good game but the sond went after i finished the two fist missions I can't even hear my gun can't hear nothing in this game it must be bug that they really need to fix
"I am going to use simple English. 1) It's a definite cash grab and the developers have essentially said ""To hell with the players"" 2) It's crazy difficult. If you don't have a controller you in for a very very tough time 3) You need a very strong Wi-Fi. You can't play offline 4) Your firing is automatic; cannot be controlled 5) You will learn the art of WAITING 6) The storyline is thin. It is a beautiful game to look at and play except for the above-mentioned. That's so freaking sad. Damn."
"In the beginning it's quite fun, good gameplay and stable graphics but the only reason why I deleted this game and posted 1 star is that this game is literally unbeatable theres some mission that is impossible not the enemy but the INFINITE loading screen that never loads and if you quit the game thinking it'll fixed it well you lost all of your progress from that mission and you need to do it all over again Im done I tried that mission many times and it ended with the same result. fix your game"
This game have level called after well level water in that i finshed that level but the level after in loading screen is stucked and can't loaded menu so i quit the game and i see the level can't be finished even i finshed that level that is happened in after levels also so please fix this problem even setting to low it is still happened so please fix it and change the intel boss minutes to 20 to 10 then i will play the game and i give five star. But otherwise this well optimized Thank you
"This game used to be so good, and now is just not playable anymore. After every single mission it gets stuck on loading screen, and you need to restart the game in order to play it again, and by doing that you loose all the progress. Uninstalling now, because there is no point trying to play it anymore. So stupid! ð¤·ð»ââï¸ð¤¦ð»ââï¸ edit: When do you plan to fix it?????"
"The newer updates always causes problems such as the hero start to acting strange and the grafics disappear ! The grafics show up and disappear like this again , again and again . The hero walk and run slower and the accurate of killing zombies become lesser than normal . There is no reason for this to happen except for the updates . I feel so bord and I can't complete the story . I uninstall it and I download it again , again and again . The problems are still happening . Uninstall it ."
I uninstalled it. The loading screen took too long no matter how long i wait. It disappoints me. I say the game is so damn good but the only problem is the loading screen. I will install it again if youall developer will fix this bug.
"Game is great, but after every mission it gets stuck on the loading screen. I've to close the game redo the mission I've already completed only then I'm able to get pass the loading screen. Please fix it, Thanks! Edit : uninstalling the game cause now it won't even play in full screen anymore. I really wanted to complete the story and play it all the way... anyways hope you'll fix all the issues. Maybe I'll play it again in the future."
"were HAD this,great game installed on our Samsung Galaxy 9+ just fine. However, it needed an update a couple of weeks ago. Tried that, but it just would NOT install the update after it had downloaded...strange! So, having tried that and failed a few times, we decided to UNinstall the game and reload it again from scratch..THAT didn't work either after a few times. It downloads apparently fine, but FAILS EVERY time when it ATTEMPTS to install, bringing us back to the 'INSTALL' option again! HELP!"
The Game is good but whenever there is In-game purchase add the sound gets off automatically... I can't even control it.
"Im having the same issues, everytime I finish a stage the game crash, and I have to start it all over again, and this happens all the time. If it wasnt for that, the game for sure would be great!! So please, fix this problem, a lot of players are waiting for this!!"
"It's a game with excellent shooting mechanics and game diversity. The unfortunate part is, during missions you run out of ammo and then you have to use the godawful melee combat which is just not fun. The first dead trigger knew how to give you ammo constantly to keep it fast paced and fun. This game doesn't have that balance. And for a f2p game, it's important for the game to be fun. This wasn't fun. This is unfortunately worse than the first game due to the bad design."
"The game is good, but saving progress is a joke. Game just freezes after completing a mission (especially story-based missions). Pls fix. Edited: Game is great, as I've written on my previous review. But I have repeated a campaign mission 10 TIMES now and I don't know why it doesn't save my progress. My internet connection is fine and I could save my progress on other missions, but I still face progress loss as the game's save feature is broken. Such a nice game, but I have to uninstall it."
This game hasn't been updated for years the only new content in this game are guns we use to kill the same zombies over and over again
"Very great game I really love it but the reason i gave 1 star is because after a couple missions the game lags and freezes and It makes me re open the app Reply: I would love to see a new tech level , it doesn't matter if it doesn't unlock a new area but maybe it unlocks new weapons. Also I'd love to see a mission where you go around the Europe area in a truck, and go looking for supplies and destroying loudspeakers, like a double mission that would be fun"
So annoying. There are many times happened that the game stucks at the loading screen. I have played a level then the screen freezes and the progress is not saved. Waste of time and effort playing. Please fix this
"Don't waste your time. Blueprints stop dropping at tech level 11, guns take literally weeks to upgrade one time, there's no goal at all only infinite grinding with nothing to achieve. It's a Unity app so it has all of Unity's bugs and design flaws, also. There's a main story but it stops really early, and there's nothing left to do after that."
"Yes it's a good game but in the africa campaign when i was in a mission titled ""Into the well"" when i was finished i was confused why the tip screen is frozen and when i restart the game the mission isn't complete but i did it again and again it's kinda disappointing because i can't finish the mission so devs please fix this bug it's really making me sadð¢ and it's been a week since this happened so please fix it. . . Just please"
"Rating this from 2 to 1. I finally had enough of the freeze bug during after missions, the game is really good and I wanted to spend more time with it. I wanna unlock everything and maximise everything but unfortunately the only thing this game gives me is frustration. Uninstalling. Will be back and re-edit my rating once the devs fix it."
"Worst graphics, worst gameplay, worst control, everything is worst about this game! Wondering how it's size is so huge!"
"Decent play style concept, but the controls are the absolute worst. No matter which control option you choose the character is extremely sluggish and runs like he's drunk. He can basically only run in a straight line. You should be able to actually turn the character to dodge through narrow gaps. Also, they make the character seem almost completely helpless. I mean, really? Give the character some balls! You've got A LOT of stuff to fix. Graphics are good though. #sad, i love zombies."
"Wow I have never been so frustrated trying to turn the controller settings to touch screen but there's no solution. The game was good back then but now it became a hell of a shitshow. The developers turned this game into a cashgrab and destroys the purpose of ""free to play"" it feels like Im playing a demo without anyway to control the character."
"I used to play this game a lot once and used to love it. Then stopped playing. After a long time now I downloaded the game. When I starterd to play, I could not control. It was showing me the control system of gamepad. But I was on phone without any kind of external device connected to the phone. I couldn't even change the setting of the control."
I can't even play this game coz it's controls are unchangeable. When I tried to change my controls it doesn't even showing any other option other then a gampad which is very annoying. I can't move my player by touching or even tilting my phone. What the heck please fix this issue which is happening with not only me but there are several people.
this. game. SUCKS! you cant do anything. all you can do is watch untill you run into a zombie! you cant move or shoot there are no controls it only gives you controls on an xbox controler! ð ð¡ð¡ð  this game is a waste of time. why would anyone want to just sit there and watch your person run in a straight line until a zombie kills you?! this is one of the worst games ive ever played! i really hope into the dead is better.
"Wow! Terrible game. I chose the controls for touching the left and right side of the screen, and it won't pick up where I'm touching unless I'm right on an incredibly specific sliver of the screen. Then I tried the one where you tilt your phone. My screen constantly kept rotating and glitching out. Above that, the game is too mundane, incredibly slow paste endless runner with ""pay to win"" mechanics. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone even if you are willing to pony up a few bucks because the..."
"I would give this game 5 stars! But one problem I play on phone and the controls are of a controller please fix this! My character just runs and when I want to control, it doesn't happen! It just runs and runs! If this keep happening, then I say to everyone that this game is super bad!"
"the game is pretty fun, i would rate it 5 stars but there is a problem. you cant really play the game because it has controls for controllers and it wont let you switch your controls. so i would appreciate if the controls get fix"
"I used to love this game. Then they added ads to everything. At one point I couldn't switch screens, open or close the app without waiting thru loud and annoying ads. I was almost full of resources and maxed out on all my gear. But with that I could not stand. Buh-bye."
"The game worked nice back in the day, came back to have some fun, then its saying I need to use a controller. I was confused, tried alot of things to change it, no, it still says I need a controller, I'm on a Galaxy A21 and can't even play the game. Was good while it last but until this is fixed, well, its just not worth downloading."
nice game but the game is kinda hard I mean really hard the daily mission have only like three (3) trials after that you will have to wait for an hour plus and that frustrating... please try to change it the previous version wasn't like that and please make the game not too difficult.. thanks
"I'm on a Xiaomi Poco F3 with MIUI 13 and Android 12. with both into the dead and into the dead 2, the games access to the phone's control resources (e.g motion sensors and touch screen) is all blocked and the game totally wants me to play with an external controller device and no settings available for phone controls. and about into the dead 2, I don't get why you insist that the game environment must be too dark and foggy mostly. please fix the controller issue and make the game brighter."
All you do is run and the preview made the game look like you can make your own weapons and do other stuff but there is one more only. and also the chainsaw runs out of gas really quick. The guns run out ammo very quick after three shootings. and the ADs were too long just to get back to the game. This game is ridiculous and corny ð¤¬ð
"I can't control it , it shows a controller in the settings for control , i tried swiping but nothing happened . I am sorry for giving this game a one star rating because i have played it's second part and it was great but i am just unable to control my character , i can't do anything , i can't call it the mistake of my device because i have played similar games. I unistalled and reinstalled the game 2 times but it didn't solve my problem."
"I used to love the game on my previous phone, but on my new phone i can't change the controls. They are only showing to play with the remote... Please try to fix it. It was one of my favourite games"
"i have played this one and the 2nd one many many times and never had either of them crash upon entry of the game. both games literally open, start to load, then they just boot me back to my home screen. this is very frustrating as neither game has ever booted me before."
"Your 8/10/2020 update has made the game unplayable! A few seconds into the game, my screen freezes - while the game seems to keep playing in the background until I'm killed. I've never had gameplay issues since this game was released back in 2013, no matter what device I was using. This new issue began right after I downloaded the 8/10/2020 update. Please fix! Prior to this, I rated this game 5-Stars across the boards. Current device = Google Pixel-C Tablet (with Android 8.1.0)"
"Grapic was good Sound effect was good too But there is no controler, so, hey, how could i control my movement? This is not a game, just a movie which is repeat and over with ""play"" button and then just put a luck that the main character will run without hit any zombie (with no controler) and see whose character will hit the longest yard."
Nice Concept. Was really excited to play just to know that this game doesn't have joystick control. Like I don't have a controller and this is a mobile game so this is suppose to have joystick one but no it doesn't. Very frustrated
We are still unable to play the game as the controls are xbox and there is no option to switch it to touchscreen. Was really looking forward to playing this....but its ruined now.
"Make some stuffs free. All items need real money which is very disappointing for us. Please make avail some equipments with game coins so that everyone can enjoy the game with more fun. And give reply for my problem. We all are not rich as you, so please make the weapons and weapon upgrades free of real money. I am very frustating with this nonsence."
"I cannot play the game. I literally can't. After opening the game for the first time, it displays controls for an analog controller and not onscreen controls. You guys should really fix this because I just wasted my time and data downloading a game I can't play. If I could give this 0 stars I would."
"for some reason I cant move different directions? i used to be able to tilt my phone to move around zombies whrn i had this game before now all that pops up is a video game controller (like my xbox one) and I cannot change it?? what the hell update - i contacted support and havent heard back. this is rediculous.. its been over a week and ive only gotten ""restart/uninstall and reinstall) which I already stated when I first messaged them. and still no reply and the issue is still there. fix it!!!"
Started game...died....retired...got weapon start...died...tried again...got chainsaw...lasted 3 seconds. Store wants money for everything by the looks of it. Maybe others will enjoy. Imma try your 2nd version. Update : 2nd game too slow to download. Tried the instant version and it wont shoot.
"I used to play this game on my HTC desire eye phone back in 2015-2016. It worked just fine. I just downloaded the game onto my Google pixel 4a and it says I need to play with an controller, as if the app does not recognize I am playing on a wireless device. I can't move to dodge or run into crates for more weapons, or even use any weapons. Loved this game, now I just can't play. Hopefully you guys can fix this issue. Going to uninstall for now due to the fact that I can't actually play."
"uhh so yeah, installed this like 2 days ago. the controls only available for xbox controller. cant move or shot just run straight. i thought they gonna fix this after a lot of complain on the controls, but its been 2 days and no responses from dev. please fix this"
this game is just run on straight line with tilt movement and for a survival person they may carry all requirements available weapon for their survival but in this game if we found a weapon then left available weapon what a good strategy of survival. control movement is very hard......ð¤ð
"Can't connect my face book acc to my game to retrieve my progress bc my game keeps crashing. One that happends I can't even get the option to connect my account at all. I have to re download the game just so I can try to connect it. Tf pikpok, this was never an issue for me until now. Please fix this problem where the game crashes just by trying to connect an account. Any og fans of this game don't bother try playing again, u won't be able to get ur progress back. Thx for ruining this gamepikpok"
i think and i was sure that this game will be amazing but when i open its controls are not working and my character is not going right nor left it is only running straight until i get died and when i pick up the gun it was not shooting bullets very bad experience i am not expected these things with this game my phone is REDMI 6 PRO
The tilt motion option is not available anymore??? It's annoying because I'm unable to move the MC with touch mode. Sometime that works and most of the time it doesn't. Help me with thisð¤
"This game used to be really good, well it used to play really good. I've played it on both samsung and apple and it ran perfectly fine. Although seeing as how it now runs like garbage and on my newer devices no less, me thinks the devs got horribly greedy. I think its clear to see if you've checked out Into the Microtransactions 2 (Into the Dead 2). I wish I could rate the Devs and not the game. Ah well, devs got greedy so now the game sucks."
"What's wrong with this game ?? I can't control anything in gameplay, Control settings shows only for analog controller & can't control game with touchscreen controls, it's really frustrating :/"
"Used to be a great game, but for some reason now there are no touch controls. It only shows controls for an external controller. Very disappointing, maybe they're just trying to push me into one of the newer versions even though I've already spent money on this one"
this is the third time...this game looks pretty cool...still the game won't last five minutes for me to play ..it just pops right back to the homescreen again and again. please fix this..i really want 2 play this game...it wasn't easy for me to give u guys one star...but u made me...let me know when u fix it.
"Great grinding game but the horrendous ads in the game kills every joy in it. 1 minute unskipable ads after the end of run is such a joke. No wonder the sequel is also lackluster. 4/5 for gameplay, 0/5 for ads."
"I remember playing this on my brother's phone years ago, and the control setting was tilt, I tried playing it today and it doesn't have any control setting for Android anymore, too bad I couldn't play it anymore."
I used to love this game but the controls now are restricted and hard to use and it shows an controller image even though a controller is not connected. Because of this reason I am changing the rating from 5 star to 1 star. Hoping to solve this quick.
i can't play with touch screen controls. The game is showing me that I have a controller but I don't have a controller. I cannot change the controls from settings. Please help
Its a good game and very enjoyable but tye problem is the control i mean the other control of it is missing i cant shoot the zombie because i need its left and right to control the running so that i cant get a bite but when i shoot the zombie the control is hard to top while shooting the zombie because they're so many of it.
I am not able to play the game at all. The moment the game opens it asks me to play the game using an analog controller and not on-screen controls. I am very disappointed and feel like i just wasted time time by downloading this game.
Used to love the game but lately i can't play the game since there's no option to change control. It shows it requires a controller to play the game and you cannot change it to touch.
You should fix the game! I couldn't change the control and it wont let me tap the screen it wants me to connect on console controller. I dont even have one. Fix the game and I'll change ny reveiw
The control shows me I'm using a joystick when I'm not using any. It made me can't move properly in the game. I'll change the stars when it fixed.
Hey im not watching any more vids cause every time i do the sound turns off until i close app and open again. Super annoying. I have a samsung galaxy AO3S please fix and ill give 5 stars.
this game is unplayable it only says i can play with a controller and will not let me choose any other form of controls i went to the website for help and all it says is to go to settings and then shows an old menu with control options that will not show up. why would i play a mobile game with a controller?
Come on Pik Pok ive installed this game on multiple accounts and still no improvement at all. It is the same issue were it sets you on the console controller and not the mobile controller and once your set on the on the console controls YOU CANT CHANGE THEM. I know you can fix this Pik Pok get on it and I will rate 5 stars because I used to have this game when it worked. FIX IT.
Omg. i used to play this game when i was younger. I recently found this again and now i cant play it because it requires a damn controller. i honestly miss the touch screen/device moving controls.
Uninstalled just because the ad that shows Into the Dead 2. I hate the fact when I'm trying to hurry and start the game again and this ad pops up with no x sign or continue button.
I unintalled it.. i can't use the controls properly. I requires joystick for you to play.. and i want to play this on my touch screen.. please return the old controls.. this was my favorite game when i was using my old phone. Now this game sucks and it's all because of it's controls.. please bring the touch screen controls back.. please..
"Couldn't even play the game, as my phone doesn't have a controller? The iOS version had two ways to play, touch or tilt, but apparently this version only has the controller? I don't have, or know how to get, a controller for my phone. If they fix that, I'll change my review, but until then I will have to recommend the second one instead."
Not able to move the player. Controls are not working. I like this game but it seems like the developer is not interested in fixing the bugs as they have developed the other versions of the game.
Hi I have been trying to play this game for a while but the game doesnt allow me to play as the controls defaults to joystick while i havent connected any joystick to the phone.is this game meant to be played only with joystick ? Or is it just a bug? Kindly reply
"The controls are stuck with the controller mode even though I'm using a mobile phone, no way to play the game. And progress cannot be synced too."
"It wasan Awsome game but after new update creator you make this game so horrible pathetic and useless,there is no need to be add more graphics,becz of that games hangs alot and the joyment of game is almost over...i,m so disappointed from new update and sorry i have to uninstall this game now."
I cant play this game on my phone. This game req gaming remote. And their is no option how to change the controls because android phone doesn't have any gaming console this game has to change their control so that every android phone user can play
Pik pok can you fix this? I cant play the game because my controls is in gamepad mode!!??? And whenever i want to fix this in the controls settings there is no option to change from the gamepad mode :((( plzzz fix this i really luv this game T.T
I cannot play it with touch or tilt controls. Only controller. And this is a mobile game. I played this before and it was 5 star but the quality has dropped considerably since then.
This is one of the good horrer games but after launching into the dead 2 this games has no better function like in some android devices it gets hanged and in some controlls dont work so for as these problems are cosidered i dislike this game i refer playing other games.
good game but the controls were for Xbox and PS4 controllers and i was playing at phone i thought watching videos gonna help but no so i hate this game never download it how do you change the controls uhh!!!! its a mobile control not an Xbox control i hate it
What the hell man!! How can you not give controls for mobile??! Instead I can see a Xone controller!! Mood off!! You guys are still solving this issue!! It's been more than 3-4 months!! A very bad service by the developers!
Please elaborate on how to change the controls to mobile friendly . Because all I can see is that the controls are of console not mobile compatible. What's a game of u can't play it.?
It is very hard game because some limited amount of bullets we get .if developers will add this type of system only we have to reload so this is ok.but we have equip the bullets this is very hard and tough challenge sometime we hanged with zombies in case we are equiping bullets and very dark interface in the game .same problems in Into the Dead 2 game
Only hate everything about this game because it won't play on my android phone. I have a Samsung galaxy J3 and the game doesn't play. The controls do not work. However have this game on my Ipad and it plays very well.
What the hell.... Game can't be controlled... It's showing Joystick controls instead of touchscreens controls.... How to play without control?????
I installed the game today only to get frustated ð¥µas I'm instructed to use a controller. I'm not able to do anything in myobile. And also I don't think there is any controller in this world that can be connected to a mobile. ð
"Game is good but it's controls are broken it shows to connect external controller, it means you can't play the game unless you have an external controller."
"I used to play this game about a year ago , today i re downloaded this game again because i used to love this game , but this time there's no control option other than using a physical joystick no touch or motion controls is it a glitch? or am i doing some mistake? i don't have a joystick neither do i want to play this game with one please help rating one star coz i can't even play it will change my review after this problem gets resolved... ð«ð«ð¤ð¤ð ð ð ð "
"Playing on thw Google Pixel 3 and when i log in it tells me the only controls to play with are for a controller. Cant move, shoot or push. Just a straight run and no way to defend myawlf."
It doesnt deserve 1 star . this game has only one contorl setting option . it hangs too much . when i tap anywhere at screen it get pause and restarts.
i am not getting whats wrong with its controls. when i am entering into the control settings a console is appearing and i cant change that setting and so i am not able to operate it. i can neither direct my run nor fire at zombies. so i am fed up and uninstalled it.
I can't find my game controll settings. In setting there is an option for only jocky. Can't use slide option on left and shoot option on right for me. Please let me know how to change it to my desire settings
Worst game I have ever played. Its even not showing the options to set my controls to tilt or to joystick.i would have given zero if there was an option for that
multiple people have said they cant play this game. i had the same experience. cant move cant shoot nothing. the controls need to have options. you guys are losing alot of people because they cant play the game. I'm uninstalling ð¤¬ð¤¬ð¤¬
"i really want to play this with my brother but then theres controller in the screen to tells us what are the buttons we will use to kill, and jump etc. and then it cant be freaking controlled!!! only you can do is to run!!! like WTH! EVEN IF YOU GOT WEAPONS YOU CANT USE IT BECAUSE YOUR GAME IS NOT WORKING"
I have this game in the past but now I'm my phone the graphics will only let me use the game controller version and I'm using a cell phone and I don't have any game controller function on a touch screen this game turned in something sake he can't even sure which it from cell phone to controller or vice versa thegame does not work on my lg lucied phone
It doesn't work well it's all controls are worst. Game graphics are cool but bad working of controls spoils everything..you should work on controls.
"what happened to this game? This used to be fun when I first played it on 2015. The control is really bad I can't do anything, why it doesn't have an option for controls it is already programmed for analog controller, dev's didn't even think of on screen controls like on ppsspp. Come on guys how can we enjoy if we can't even fight."
I canot play the game as when i open it first pick pock logo appear for 1 minute then i get black screen then nothing else So guys fix this problem this game looks amazing and want to play it on my phone but i cannot help......!!ð­
What happened to your control...it has been worst now screen rotation doest not work..even tap control is not working ...please make the character movement smooth and more flexible
im using a phone but the controls need some sort of controller. i played this before and the controls can be switched.
Control are difficult.......it's are joystick control .......so difficult ... graphics good and sound effects nice ....that it's
"No touch controls! the only available control is through a controller? seriously? before we can use touch controls, now we cant!"
In redmi 7 it have control of a console. I cant use touch screen!!!! Get it fixed!(10/oct/2020) Edit- 16 oct 2020 .... I tried it again... Still not working .... Its showing picture of an playing console.......! See reviews of redmi 7 of this game.... Everyone have same problem!!!!!
"the game doesnt work on android. there is no controls so youre just running then die like a punk. really too bad cause one time i got a sweet gun but couldnt shoot these dang z-boys in the face. really wanted to blast these baddies, shame."
"i don't know,Why this game showing only controller controls. I used to with the mobile controls. So whats the reason behind it . Or it is wheather a bug or something else?? Please clarify@ Developer"
I like this game very much.. But its controls are not working... Help me please.. In setting its showing PS remote controls...
"Bad, what type of mobile game does not have touch controls, only controls for using a controller, I had to uninstall it. Please let us know when the issue has been fixed"
"I just downloaded but can't switch the controls so i can move, so i just been running in a straight line, and that just sucks too."
i did not enjoy it because im being forced to use a controller which i do not have. i miss the old days when you could simply tap on the screen or tilt your phone so you could play that way
Currently unplayable on my LG k30. Controls were set to controller settings from the start despite never connecting to a controller. There is no in-game option to change this.
It is showing only joystick controls...and i am not able to play as i don't have a joystick ...why is there no other options for the controls? Ans plz..
How can one play any game in smartphone if controls are of a console. Really frustrating if I can't control the character. Really need a fix.
How come you can't play this using your phone only? It requires me to have a controller... Should have told it before the download. Uninstalled it right away. Not even a feature to have a controller using the screen only
"Bro how am I supposed to play this if I can't even see any controls on my screen for redmi note 7 pro? It's in joystick mode which apparently is no way of playing on my phone, anyone can help with this?"
"Maybe I'm retarded. But controls are unswitchable. It's shows me a controler that I don't have, no tap, no tilt. Nothing. Frustrating"
What is exactly happened to this game?! Where is the touch and tilt control settings?! I only see external controller setting. Bring back the touch and tilt control.
This game sucks so bad what happened to the old controls now all of a sudden it's saying that I have to play with a controller so this game is pretty much pointless to download if I can't even work the controls ð 
I like the game its the freaking controls when i play i cant move or fire all i can do is pause the controls are console controls not mobile controls im frustrated by this change it to mobile controls plsss.
Very bad experience there is no control options for Android. This is only showing joy pad gaming mode.
game doesnt have any controls? just watch the screen untill you run into zombies. cant shoot cant turn ect..
"RIP OFF!! I loved this when I started my first world! Then I guess it did an update or something, and it needed me to retrieve my world from my phones memory, which it wouldn't actually do. I gave it the benefit of the doubt despite losing weeks of building, and I started over. Yesterday, it did it again after fighting with the game for several days and trying to make it quit crashing my phone every. Single. Time. That I logged in. Thumbs way way down. I paid for the game and can't play it."
"Edit: still crashing. It's not my phone because every other app is working fine. Only Minecraft. Every single time it's gets to 'building Terrain', it freezes up and then crashes. What's the problem? I bought and can't play it, that sucks. Great until it just decided to crash everytime I tried to play. Y'all need to put some troubleshooting options in here because I don't like paying for games that just go stupid for no reason."
"i have had minecraft for many years now, and have enjoyed every update thoroughly, playing in my own worlds as well as exploring other peopleâs creations. i have never had an issue with the game that had been unfixable, but since i updated, i cannot join my friends. it tells me there is no ping and to reload my clinet, so i do and it doesnât work. i have restarted, used wifi and data, and still nothing. this was a bug update, but it only created more problems. i cannot give more than one star."
"I used to have this rated as five stars, but the new ""update"" changed that. They made the game literally unplayable with the new controls. I miss the old D-pad and crosshair, which made sense and worked like it should. Now I have to use the joystick (although it brings me no joy) and clutter up the right half of my screen with different buttons which were originally functions of different ways of tapping the screen. If this is changed, I will change my review back to what it was."
"Not sure what's going on but the new update has pretty much ruined the whole game for me. There are constant connection issues between me and other players. Issues with connecting to other players' worlds as well as issues with them connecting to mine. The format is different, but you can change that in settings. Ultimately I'm disappointed and wish I had never re-download the app, definitely a waist of money."
"Deserves 5 stars, however I've been playing for the past few days with my girlfriend on our own world and put in quite a bit of effort. The only issue is now I can't join the world to continue making progress. We're friends on the app, the map is set to friends of friends, and we have mobile data playing on. Either way, I can't continue an old map, let alone a new one we tried that, I even reinstalled the game and reset my phone. Would love to leave a bug report but I can't even log in there ð¤·"
"The game itself is great, always loved Minecraft. But the newest updates have ruined the experience for me. Laggy, glitchy, slow, broken. Just much prefer console. Yet Microsoft ruined that too, made very laggy and bland, no trees or mobs. So my advice, if you want the true experience of Minecraft, then play the legacy edition of the game on Xbox 360 or PS3. Much better smoother experience on those versions, simple, and fun. Also the new controls suck."
"What a buggy mess. I've been a Minecraft PE player for years and have enjoyed it for the most part. But there is a serious issue: After the most recent update, the game is virtually unplayable, after just a minute or so in a world, the textures begin to glitch, entire button interfaces fade out and the game lags and glitches constantly. At certain points entire ground textures don't load allowing visibility through the entire world. I figured it'd be fixed by now, but no. Fix this, please."
"Horrible, started off okay but now i have a number of downloaded texture packs and maps that have just gone missing with no help from the developers to get my items returned, regardless of the fact that i paid for them. On top of this the game is unusable, it starts off with every option you dont want, turned on, and any attempt to change that will be met with a kick or freeze from the game, or no change at all. This includes fov, sensitivity, beautiful skies, fancy graphics or button size."
"It's a good game, but I can't join my friend, I can't join no one, I literally tried everything, switching to cellular data, making a new Microsoft account, deleting the game and reinstalling, checking for updates, looking at YouTube videos on how to fix it, ect. None of it works, it's keeps saying: ""unable to connect the world."" I don't know if it's a bug or something, but it needs to get fixed. I wasted seven dollars just for that."
"""Oops! Your Microsoft account was disconnected. Sign in and reset your world to play with friends."" Every day I see this. There is no Reset option. Anywhere. And I can sign in and out a thousand times with no result. My friends can't invite me. I can't invite them. It's getting annoying!! The rare times when my friend's invite comes through, it says it's connecting to multiplayer game and stays there for ages. Please fix this!! Or suggest a way to fix it"
"After last update with the warden, there is nothing but glitching. all you can do is walk into the jumble of lights and glitch until you run into a block that you can't see. I can save and quit and restart and it will work fine for about 30-40 second and then start the massive glitching again. It happens above ground and in the caves, doesn't matter where you are."
"I use a mobile device and everytime I try signing into my xbox account, minecraft crashes. I have tried lots of things to fix this, uninstalling and re-installing the app, restarting my phone, even as a desperate last attempt I factory reset my phone, losing all music and pictures. And still, it crashes. I don't know if it's just my phone, but if this is happening to anyone else, please, fix this."
"Minecraft vertical sensitivity has a always been broken on Android, I can't believe it hasn't been fixed after all these years. All they have to do is add a vertical and horizontal sensitivity, problem solved. Instead, it is one adjustment slider that controls both vertical and horizontal. The problem is, Vertical sensitivity is so much faster than horizontal to the point that it makes me motion sick. If I lower it to a normal speed then horizontal sensitivity is way too slow. Please fix!!!"
"I can't seem to download it. I deleted it for a while, but when I wanted to reinstall it, it went all the way to 100% and then suddenly said ""can't install"". I've tried everything from deleting the cache and data from Google Play and Google Play Services, I've checked to see if I had enough space, which I do, and my device is compatible with the app, yet it still won't download. It's a great app, and I really hope this can be fixed somehow."
"This app is garbage. I have spent hours debugging basic net connectivity to my server and am still getting the genius MS/Mojang concept of error handling: ""Can't connect to world."" Here's a thought: provide more granular error handling/UX messaging and fix the networking/user profile spaghetti code. I should have been able to connect in 5 mins. and the app should be showing a friendly tracert of how far it gets and where the delays are. If I can't resolve this issue soon, I will return it."
"This is really disappointing. I was waiting to get Minecraft for so long now and when i did it wont work. I tried all ways to fix it but nothing is working. I checked all the important things such as my storage and stuff and everything is fine. I cant seem to understand why it won't install the app especially that i have been waiting so long to do this. It would go to 100% installed but then the ""Cant install app"" screen pops up â¹ï¸"
"Where do I start... My skins still don't load, my marketplace still doesn't load, my realms don't work, I still can't just remove things out of my inventory in creative mode, and now I cannot do quick block breaking in creative mode either. It's like they are playing a game of how can we make this game suck even more with every update. Oh but if I want to try and sort through their feedback site I can submit a bug report that doesn't ever get fixed anyway. I used to love this game."
"All my worlds are gone. I didn't move files to another device or anything. I've just been updating the app as updates become available and now when I log into my Microsoft account (which I've always had for this app, I never had a Mojang account) to play the game with my profile and purchases, everything is gone. I didn't delete anything from my phone and my App settings page shows that quite a bit of storage is used by the app, so clearly the data is still there but I can't find it."
"In the new update I can't join my brother's world at all, and the controls are messed up, I found a bug I think to get the old controls back but it's probably gonna be fixed soon. Everything about this recent update sucks. In creative mode, the blocks break so slowly now that its sad"
"What's with the last update!?!? It won't let me go into my realm and when I'm in it kicks me out! I'm paying for a month of service, if it's going to have problems, pro rate it. That's like buying 7.99 worth of gas and only being able to use a part of it. Very disappointed."
Lost all my worlds and i cant figure out how to get them back. I paid a lot for this game is this is what i get. I have been playing minecraft for a long time a few years ago and this has never happened to me before. The controls are also bad and the game tends to crash and lag. 0 stars
"the game ALWAYS logs my account out, and when I log in it DOES NOT WORK. I have to to uninstall and re-download it again and again and again. A very ridiculous game. I shouldn't have wasted money on this. edit: I've downloaded the game again, it WON'T let me sign in for some reason. I can't connect to the market place nor change my avatar skin. If 0 star rating exists, i will give it to this game."
"Used to play pc version years ago and felt like playing again. The old version i played years ago played really good but lost that phone, the new pc version barely works. I've had comments saying bad phone or bad internet but my phone is solid and I even tried a special ethernet cord for it. Nothing works and app either crashes on load screen or when clicking play, after it loads my player skin and name. Hopefully the game crashes gets fixed so I may be able to enjoy the game like I used to"
You cannot pause your game. This has been requested for over 4 years. they wont implement it. Pause menu doesn't pause. Not even turning off your screen will pause. You have to save and quit everytime. In singleplayer. The minecraft feedback forum has people upset over this since 2019. people on switch are playing this version and can't pause either. and mojang does nothing about it.
"Honestly. This game is amazing. It's my all time favourite game and I've spent many hours, days, months and years on it building my worlds. But one update came and all my worlds are now lost and i was signed out of my account... I can not find the worlds anywhere, even by following your instructions exactly. I dont know why you've made an external storage change like this but u need to put it back to how it was. We cant access the files like you say we can. They arnt there. Please fix this. ð¤"
"If it looks like you lost your worlds go to minecraft settings in the app, go to settings, and change file location from external back to application. They messed up the default settings in the update, going to cause a lot of problems with people who think they lost their worlds"
"I love minecraft pe and have played it for a long time and up until a week ago I had never had any problems with it. Now if it ever loads past 63% without jumping out of the game altogether, it looses all my worlds when I go back into it. I have spent a very long time on my worlds and now I've lost all my progress. I have the recommended specs on my device and plenty of storage room so what is causing this? I've tried all the recommended remedies but to no avail. Can anyone help?"
Immediately purchased a $5.99 Skyblock pack and it didn't register my coins or unlocks... but it took my money. I have contacted the developers several times with all required evidence and now have gotten put on the back burner. I have not heard from them. I had the game less than 3 hours and got robbed it seems. Now I have to go through Google Play.
Well I have been having problems with Game in both Xbox and phone versions for some reason it keeps saying that is unable to connect to the world's that my friends create and it started happening after the new update they need to fix this.
"My worlds disappeared and I worked so hard on them, I can't find them anywhere, this bug makes the game unplayable, I didn't delete the game or clear the cache, or data, I opened the app to find me logged out and everything gone, even when I logged back in they didn't show back up, and I combed through all my files, why does this happen"
"Minecraft is one of my favorite games, but an issue has recently occurred with me. I purchased the game and tried to install it, but the issue was that it reached 100 percent and then would say unable to install minecragt even after I payed for the game. I have tried to install it 5 times, but still the problem continues. If the problem is fixed I will increase my rating to 5 star"
"I really like this game but it literally will not update. Every option it gives me to fix it won't work. I js bought this game. Maybe a little more than a month ago. Haven't had it downloaded for long and it won't work. Also got a notice that said it may stop working on my device, which is completely rude because my phone is only two years old and I keep it well updated. I was so excited for this game until this recent news. Please fix this."
"Still the same old issues, it's getting so damn frustrating...cannot join friends or family or vice versa. What's so difficult about making that work? We're literally on the same network and have the latest version and even updated. It's maddening"
"The only thing that made me rate Minecraft 1 star instead of 5 stars that something weird happened. When I opened Minecraft, my screen turned black. Then I restarted Minecraft. But when I restarted, my worlds my profile all of my hardwork in those worlds...just got deleted. It took me so much time to build all of that and it was gone...my profile and everything else was saved but my worlds were gone. I didn't make a profile to save them in. Idk if they will be back but plz fix this bug"
"1.20 waiter + I have no idea what is going on with the Emotes~ Also, to go back to the old controls, choose ""D-Pad & tap to interact"". Also, there's no ""D-Pad & aim crosshair"", but you can use ""D-Pad & tap to interact"" + ""Split Controls"" as it."
"Minecraft has come a long way. Microsoft bought it, started their own version. And I, personally, do not like how they have treated our game. When Mojang was in charge, for $20 you could buy the game, and then the rest is up to you. You have the software, you're free to do whatever you want. Then, Microsoft ruined Minecraft. micro transactions. That's what ruined Minecraft. They took the best part, the freedom, destroyed it, then sold the bits that were left back to you for exorbitant prices."
"Please fix the unable to connect to the world when trying to play with your friends with Microsoft account. Its annoying. 1 month in and still not fixed. 1 year since reported, nothing changed. Still can't play with friends on myltiplayer cause of ""unable to connect to the world"""
"Spent months playing this game. The second the world file became too large for the device it just deleted it. Tried to recover it but theres no avaliable folder listed as either of the ones they recommend to recover old worlds. What a shame. Almost thought this was a good rendition of this game but anything thatll just wipe months of progress and shrug at you is a joke. Cant even rebuild the world with cheats on cause I lose achivements. Thanks guys. PE, broken since 2014."
"PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING HOLY fix the dang custom skin error!! I have tried uploading downloaded skins, and the error pops up like ""That's not a minecraft skin, silly."" Please fix it. I only experienced this because I had to re-download the game due to my gamertag not switching to my new one. I'm getting annoyed, frustrated, and tired of trying to fight the game constantly to upload a skin. I'm VERY disappointed with mojang. Fix your damn game."
"Do something about the resolution. It's so long that I can't even play the game. When I try to enter or create a world, it will ask me to choose a control method. But then the screen was zoomed in for whatever reason. I can't even proceed with anything since only the return button was visible."
"Any other day than today, I would've rated this 5 stars. It is a phenomenal game, with the chance of unlimited creativity. But, since you decided on moving my worlds to an external storage, they were deleted. I had spent 3 years of my life on this platform, working on worlds. I had so many mods and worlds, banished to the shadow realm. I have no way to recover them, no way to restore them. This is not forgivable. I had spent so much time on this. All my progress, gone, forever."
"Awful. New awful controls, and it's always been bad because, one, minecraft itselfs ""updates"" add a new useless mod and a retextured wood. It's like Iphone but with games. A cash grab that they say changed when it doesn't. But thie version sucks especially, because to get stuff on the marketplace, it costs MONEY. yeah. Up to $10.00 for a map of a city. Ridiculous. While on the clearly better edition java, you can get everything on there, (which has better and more mods in general) for free. Yeah"
"This game was known to work on high settings on some of the weakest devices. However, a recent gfx update makes it unplayable on certain devices even on the lowest settings due to lag. I am a recent buyer and I find this frustrating, but no longer qualify for a refund due to being offline for several days after purchase. Please make the graphics less detailed on mobile devices like it used to be. Update: Just was notified it will soon be discontinued on my device. I guess its high end only now."
it wont let me add my skin! I used to be able to use the skin i been using since 2021 and it doesn't want to let me use it now. It keeps saying it's not a skin! I even tried downloading one from online and even those don't work when they clearly are skins. Please fix this issue bug or whatever it is. I want to be able to use MY mc skin.
"ITS BEEN TWO WHOLE UPDATES AND THEY WONT FIX MULTIPLAYER. REALMS IS ONLY WAY TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS. Used to play daily... Recently I can't connect to multiplayer and neither can my fiancee when we try to join each other's world it fails to connect. Only the servers work, no joining a friend's world. It's ridiculous I've seen the large number of complaints so y can't they? Seriously about to give up on mobile bc it's obviously not a priority for them they just want our $$ @ this point ð¤ð¤ð§"
"Whenever I mine blocks, nothing drops. This just started happening out of nowhere. I have made sure that the block drop feature is on in the options, but still nothing."
"Cant upload custom skins, using the right format and size, but it only gives an error saying that its not a skin, doesnt help that the error message sounds so condensensing, makes me want to punch someone."
I love Minecraft but for whatever reason I cannot play it I'm connected to Wi-fi I have a little bit of data on as well and it just keeps kicking me out. It gets to the main screen I tap on my world it starts to load and then the app just shuts. I'm just going to uninstall it if it's not going to work why play it?
"By far one of the worst developer teams out there. They show tons of cool features... and then add like only 3 of them in a single update. They act nice, but are liars. There is no archeology. There is no fireflies. There is no wild update (A new subbiome and a structure that was already completed isnt ""wild."" ) On top of that, they claim to do this because of ""quality,"" like the game isn't already filled with hundreds of bugs they purposely ignore. Lazy liers."
"Had 5 star rating, but changing because new update is unable to connect to relm. 2/26/23 Got that figured out. Now, less than 3 weeks later, 3/17/23, all Android users must figure out how to recover their worlds from monthly paid spaces. Must have internal storage. But can only use a file with forward slashes, which can not be created. Do not recommend paying mincraft for storage unless you enjoy losing your building progress."
Double charged for purchase. Showed same amount on same date... Not sure how that even went through since I only have one Google account and why my bank's automated system didn't recognize it as a duplicate transaction. Something smells fishy here.
always requiring update to connect to friends. Updating fails too often requiring additional troubleshooting. I just want to open it and play with my kids without hassle. Not too much to ask.
"I got to play multiplayer but didn't get to play single player. Everytime I created a world and wanted to play on it, the tutorial screen is too zoomed in to the fact that I can't get out of the screen so I'm stuck there and is not able to join offline single player worlds"
"Google support is very poor! Tried purchasing this game twice to add it to my family library (so that kids can play).. it says it's eligible for family library but it refuses to be added to the family library (chromebook edition)... and Google Support is absolutely unhelpful... they point you at their FAQs, when you have contacted them because the FAQ solutions did not work! Game play on the Chromebook trial was very poor."
"after a new update, I can't connect to other's player world anymore. it keeps loading and unable to connect. please fix it ASAP. I will change the star rating when the issues fix, thanks."
I've been building a world for the last 7 months. After updating Minecraft my world has completely disappeared. I've searched through my phone to find it. I've spent hours watching videos on YouTube and reading through Post online with absolutely no luck
"It won't let me play my world thats called ""raft survival"" sold on the marketplace after I've played it for so long. I'm so upset I tried reinstalling the app and that didn't work. And I tried putting it on a realm and that didn't work either. It doesn't need an update."
"Minecraft was always my Favorite game, but now I cant play it anymore at all. If i try to open the App, it doesnt work, if im lucky it opens once after i restart my tablet but even if im in the game, i cannot join old worlds or create a New one anymore. Minecraft also logged me out of my Account and now everything is gone. All my worlds and progress from since 2020."
Purchased game . Decided to move game to another phone(both androids) so I could Screencast to TV. It wants me to buy it again. I've bought 3 Xbox one disc of minecraft (kids are rough on disk) I've paid too much for mine craft as it is. Both phones are mine and running my Google ID I've Had for like 15 years. Doesn't make sense
"It's an ok game to be honest but for the last 3 hours I've been trying to log into my account and it keeps saying ""Are you logging into your Microsoft account from this android? Only continue if this is you"" and i keep pressing continue and it keeps sending me to Minecrafts homepage. No matter how many times i delete Minecraft it still is the same and it's driving me crazy."
I've been playing for years and the new update has honestly caused my phone to glitch to the point it won't even let me turn off my phone. This never happens with any other app. Now my phone won't even let me download it. Years of using this game on this device and now I can't play it. Please fix this!!!
After this recent update my d pad and anologe sticks don't work on my controller. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it worked for a second. It makes the game unplayable in my opinion and I'm giving up on trying. Back to java ig.
Android v1.19.62 on my S22 Ultra is unable to join a multiplayer Windows game running v1.19.62. It worked last weekend. A Fire tablet running v1.19.60 connected to the Windows game. Once I updated the game on the Fire tablet to v1.19.62 it still connected.
If you want to play on servers the. It will go slow and disconnect. And if you want to play with friends it won't load. Also if you want to add your own server it won't work. Adding seeds won't work either
"I'm getting crazy due to inventory losing bug. I don't know why but I can't play MC offline cause the game loses my inventory and therefore all my stuff get lost. It only happens when I connect my Microsoft account to MC. So when I play offline it can't connect to my Microsoft account and the game make a new ""account"" on my worlds."
"Why force accounts, but you won't save player made skins. Impossible to actually find what you own in the store. Almost impossible to play ANYTHING YOU OWN offline. Sadly this game is becoming a cash grab that forces you to always be online."
Cannot play a multiplayer game on mobile. Only works if it is a realm and not a local game someone has hosted by their PC or other mobile device. Defeats the entire reason why I bought it on my phone.
Try and try to download and still nope I cant it's so weird that it wont let me download the game. A while ago I had an update I went to update and it did not so I tried and tried but it did not so it gets a -9/10 Fix it mojang or someone!!!!!!
I played for HOURS. Looking high and low for iron and could not find a single block !! This game is impossible to play without iron and I already paid 7 bucks for it :( please fix this ASAP!!
"I joined the beta programme. Then I left it, suddenly my skin got removed so I try to re do it. When I do all of it correctly, skin dimensions correct and file type Correct; âthis is not a Minecraft skin, silly.â FIX THIS MOJANG ð¡ð¤¬"
Always adding update to the point that I can't update anymore or play with friends so I deleted it and try to redownload it and it won't let me and that is the only app I had on my phone takes up way too much space and you need a really expensive phone to play this game
"First you mess with the controls a bunch and now I can't even use skins I downloaded because it isn't a skin silly, IVE USED THIS SKIN FOR YEARS! Bro I can't even click faster to take stuff from furnaces and I can only split in half's instead of having the bar thing which I think is dumb having to split stuff in half's!"
After 1.19.80 update creative mode looks more like survival. I can't destroy blocks in high speed. It's so annoying. How would I be creative when creative mode is more like survival. Fix that please
"Having a problem with servers not able to join other than that game is pretty amazing, extremely good graphics, garbage hackers, overall 70/100"
"My PC servers wont transfer over to mobile, this game is pointless, censor words that are not even explicit words like come and welcome. Signs don't hold tabs or enters. Achievements buggy. Game logs out when I tab out. These issues have been here for bedrock PC and app for years. Joke of a company Mojang, you make millions and don't fix bugs."
"Bought the game and know can't play it. I bought this game through Google Play, and now when I launch the game all I get is ""license Error"" and it closes. I'm logged into Google on my phone and Google Play. TRASH GAME."
I was purchased this app from play Store.......before 1 year ago I developed my Minecraft world best but from some reason I was deleted this app from my phone also delete data from Android folder.....but today I installed this app again and try to login my world.....but there is no option to recover my old world.....this app need a storage backup for login my world.....how to put old data file to open my world.......ð¡ð¡
"I purchased different types of clothes and accessories, and some of those is not working on multiplayer server, my skin automatically changing to yellow steve everytime I join multiplayer server."
"""Unable to Connect to World"" -I've been experiencing this issue ever since after the skin glitch happened and no, it's not my internet connection or router or even my phones because I tried multiple devices and wifis from different places. Friends can't join me and I can't join them and some of my friends are experiencing this issue, I came back after 1-2years still not fixed, bruh. Tried everything to fixed it! Please fix this! Do you guys care about the community or the money we spent on?"
"The new setting changes are very unnecessary, it just made it more complicated, plus the removal of external files. It's the worst :("
"If you are going to have an offline-playable option, then do not make the game unplayable with a ""Checking For License"" screen that demands you go online. I love this game, but this one problem is experience-breaking. Please fix, and I will re-review"
Can't even move minecraft to my new phone after I've paid for it! It should follow my Google account but no evidently not it wants me to pay another $6.99.... I love the game but I'll stop playing it if I have to buy it every time I get a new device!
"Honsetly I've had fun with this game but ever since the last update I cant put custom skins in, and some things are slow now. Until its fixed my rate is gonna be low ð"
"I don't know what is happening to this new update Minecraft, i want to complain that i cannot join other player map/ server, like connection error something like that, i thought it's just my internet but other people complain the same thing, and other game i try to play it worked? I think Minecraft having problems?"
"when i dont play minecraft for like 1 week and open it with no wifi, my account get logged out and my world just gone or got corrupted. I tried to search on youtube and fix it but nothing happen. Please fix this immediately ð­ð"
"This game was fun until it updated and deleted all my worlds and told me to try to recover them from my internal storage. I went to my internal storage, and there was nothing there. I had no help at all. This game sucks now. Definitely won't be playing it for a while now. i made so much progress, and now it's all gone. Just know that if you are going to download this game, it will probably update and erase all your progress with 50/50 chance of getting it back."
I don't if it's just me but the game doesn't even allow me to join any of my friends anymore after the new update. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and even restarted my phone but nothing works and my skins I've bought won't even load it just shows a loading symbol next to the minecoins.
"Hi, after the latest update all my worlds that i spent years working on disappeared. I checked external storage or whatever and it wasnt there. I never had a mincraft accont and i really would like it if you could try to get my worlds back. Thank you in advance."
Won't let you uninstall it from your phone or tablet. You have to uninstall it through the store only. It closes you out when you attempt it. It has become a glitchy game overall and I don't believe they'll repair it anytime soon.
"There aint no way im paying for minecraft twice, especially just to play on chromebook. Ive already thrown my money at Mojang 5 times, ill change my review when the mobile version counts as the chrome os version and I dont have to pay for it again"
This game was really good and deserves a 5 star but the new update made the game frustrating to play. The buttons to jump and sprint are really small and its hard to press them when on mobile. The joystick is also really small and the placement is inconvenient when trying to run away from something in survival or just in general. I really like this game but if its possible could you make an option where you can reset controls to original?
The game won't allow me to join my friends world...I've tried many types of method to fixed it but it still won't work...what kind of a game who doesn't allow friends to join their world who cannot even fixed it until the next update...I've been paying 7 buck for this game to play with my friends but still doesn't allow me to join on my friends world....so frustrating I hope the Company understand this situation and take RESPONSIBLY for their clients ð¡ð¡
Mojang Please fix this issue. When i decided to delete your game and pressed the keep app data. but then when i Reinstall it i cannot install it
Dear mojang. This game was my love but when Android 13 came I can't recover my old savefile from Android folder. Android 13 stopping Minecraft to enter the following directory where game is addressing. Please help!!!
After the recent update there is some many bugs in the game such as you cant stack hooper to the box even when crouch it doesn't work. This really spoil the game and i hope this problem can be fix immediately
"Multiplayer is so bad connection wise. It always says unable to connect and that's it, no further elaboration. I only managed to play with my friend once and I couldn't anymore after that. Fix this"
Won't let me download the game. I always make sure I have enough storage so it's not that- it doesn't work at all when I try to download. 0/10 do not recommend wasting your money on this game.
"I only installed this to play with my friends and i can't even do that because every time I try to connect in a world it says ""unable to connect to world"""
"Due to the gender-messages, racial-messages, esg-messages, and other divisive-messages that keep coming across the screen....we will be deleting the game. These are not topics for children. They play the game to have fun and create works of art. They do not play the game to be subliminally indoctrinated by progressive-nonsense. Congratulations, you've permanently lost patrons. Think of what that means. Word of mouth travels fast. How many will be alerted due to this post alone?? Unfortunate..."
"It deserves zero stars because, when I try to play in peace, the ads always interrupt me and make me wait to get back to the game. Plus, everything on here is glitched up and I remember a game just like this but came out before this one. The quality I can tell is either too high, or too low. The steering is to drift too. P.S. Also it won't let me put zero stars so I put one."
"So, the mile distance counter(which is the main way you unlock cars) is off. I went down a straight stretch at the airport counting to 30 after I hit top speed of 160 and I only went .68 miles. Explain that. If you are going 120 you should go 1 mile every 30 seconds. But I was going even faster. So, it just looks like another sly way to get you to play the game longer and watch more ads."
"I have no why this game needs internet to play. And the actual reason is that you need to play the game in between the ads if you are still interested. It's like a torrent website where you get an ad regardless of where you click. An ad for a pause, and ad to resume, an ad at regular intervals disrupting the gameplay and ads at damn who knows when time. Very dissatisfied. It's a test of your patience."
"It was a fun game when it was older, and when I started playing it again, I almost got the Bugatti, and I had just gotten the fast Ferrari after grinding. I later went to play with my new cool car and then... My account was DELETED, and so was my Ferrari and chance of that new Bugatti...Now I hate the game and rate it ONE STAR.( Do not play if you plan on getting better cars or want to enjoy them)..."
"Used to be good, latest update ruined it for me and most likely a lot more people, you can no longer unlock every car without paying, why? Because you can only get diamonds by paying, there should REALLY be a way to get diamonds without paying irl money, maybe a way to convert ingame money into diamonds or get diamonds from those trials, just a stupid change"
It sucks I can't even start actually playing the game. It keeps on sending me back to the install screen. ? mm McDonald's chicken nuggets
I used to play this game a lot on my old pc. This game does not work on chromebook. It kicked my out as soon as i went to play. Other than that im done
The game is quite fun at the start but when you play more of it it justs boring and please make the cars more cheaper because i can't get any of my favourite cars all the cars i have in the are the ones i hate! The game has a good update but can I justs pay credits for the megaskins please ðð¢ and there should be a lamboghini hurracan in the game.
Why can't I get the VIP cars. Before this update it was good. Now you can get VIP cars only with VIP pass that's not good.
It is the dumbest game I ever play 'cause when I am able to buy the most expensive car you just update the dumbest game and turn gold cars into diamonds car now how can I afford the most expensive car ð¤¬ð¤¬ð¤¬
"I used to love this game as i played since 2017 but the game just had there worst update yet, the most expensive vehicle in the game went from being 175k cash to being 9k gems, if I was playing the game 5 months ago I would have said ""I'll be able to get this vehicle in 1 week"" but now it could take years, I uninstalled the game and I'm done, I will hope to look back and see how much of a great game it was."
"Not Nice ð¡ I purchased the VIP. I thought it was saved on the account. Then I uninstall the game because my parents is about to check if there is game on my phone. But when I re-download the game, my VIP cars is all gone, my progress is also gone, but it still say that I already got the VIP pass. But I still doesn't get all of my progress before. Please repair this."
I want multiplayer why you don't understand all games are cool ð because of multiplayer but in this game we should play alone like 1 day after we think what we should do in this game so we will delete it please try to understand the people are supporting the multiplayer game use your brain add multiplayer.
the best game is the world ð¤ð i have a bug that i want ro be fixed so the sports car mersedes can not be dezined please fix this bug. hey where are my mega skins that i paid 20000 on like its not loading i hate this game because of this update like NO NO NO NO like stoooop it wont load.
"I bought subscriptions and other in game stuff and it's all not even there, it shows I have VIP but I still get ads, don't have VIP cars, and to add to my convenience, ever since I bought the gamepasses my game crashes within 5 minutes or every time I try to switch cars... I will be expecting a refund for this so I'll keep it installed until that happens."
"Adverts everywhere. Way too intrusive. A shame since the game looked interesting but the developers are too greedy. A banner ad at the bottom that you can't remove, plus unskipable video ad when I pressed the back button. I only lasted 2 minutes. Bye bye!"
Normally I'm not one to be mad about ads but there's so much as it's almost impossible to actually play the game you think you'd be able to live with it but now after getting redirected three times while having the game completely restart three times it gets a little annoying also the controls are absolutely horrible I tried doing a little drifting but even that is nearly impossible to do without completely sliding out to be honest this game completely lost it's fun
"The amount of ads in this game is mind blowing. The developers ruined the game by trying to make alot of money from ads. I would love to play more because it's a good game but i won't because of how much ads there is in the game. Even if i just open the menu there's an ad and when i go to the garage there's an ad. The amount of ads destroyed the game for me, just to make extra moneyi can't believe that the developers would do this. It's honestly just sad to see and the controls needs to be fixed"
It wouldn't even allow me to play I would like to see the game in action and since I haven't played in like 2 years maybe one year can't remember I'd like to see the new graphics but it wouldn't even let me in it would make it to the loading screen and then kick me out
"if there is a no star i would put that, because every time i get on the game on cromebook it logs me out and on my phone it doesnt log me out. this game sucks and i hate it."
Very disgusting and useless app. It is not properly working please fix it.
Cause In challenge 2 tl you can't even do anything cause you cant . Win? Cause. It's a junk game fix it.
"No way to change gears, the break pedal reverses, no way to look left and right from within the car to check the blind spot... This app simulates what? Not a car. Not to mention the super annoying ads."
"Very bad game . It give a ad every time you click on any button It is very annoying because the ads does not contains a skip ad button,you will have to watch the ad even if you don't want to watch"
This is name of ads many ads are comming again and again .so don'nt downed this game
it keeps glitching and kicks me out. It needs more things to do aswell.
It is very bad changeing because 1 coin in 1500 but before 1 coin in 150 and vip car are not available but why not available ð ð¿ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡ please available cars
After update game is not running just restart again and again.

I accidentally deleted the game please give my progress back i worked so hard for it please.
Hello My self Ritik I am using this game for 6 months in last update I my game is not working well I faced many problems in this game from last update
New update one thing is very bad the last car in dimond and dimond purchase with real money what is this updated 3rd class
This stupid game will not let me log in for multiple times and I've had it with the stupid game and so are you and you shouldn't even have a 1 star ya dummies! This is DEFINITELY NOT EXCITING. I have a 100% strong about what I just said.
If I could I would rate this zero.it used to be cool but now they try to get you to spend like $50 on one paint job for one car on a game where ads pop up every 5 secs don't waist your time!!!!skip past this game unless less you rich and extremely patient
riddled with ads. it stinks. you can't go 30 seconD's without a 30 second ad.
Trash the cars don't have a setting to go the same speed as the fake cars.U can't get out the vehicle to do rile plays and u can't go in buildings and there is no multiple player
I can't able to see the outside cars when I am In my car please change the rule You won't change this type of rule I will uninstall the game ð¡
Too many ads and short breaks while playing game.
It's blocking the mobile options while exit by back buttuens ...
The game is good other than $30 just for a car skin but I have one major problem I keep buying my cars and everytime I go off the game and open it back up all my cars I bought will be gone and it don't give me my money back
Worst ad experience and game degrading with each update I am greatly disappointed in mobile gaming
This game is too much great but the problem is to hanging ð
"Horrible. Couldn't even play the game because of the ads covering the bottom of the screen. You can pay to remove the ads, but I couldn't play the game enough to decide if I wanted to pay for it."
every bad game.why do we need a commercial break couldn't u place ads I'm good place. Disappointing
World's worst game ever in the destruction mode there is no sufficient time to complete the destruction mode
I bought a pack and it said cars+mega skin and then only gave me the mega skin that was included to a car I already owned that was offered in the pack
I buy a skin in 3000 gold after 2 hours and 30 minutes this game don't show it again and I can't use time again
Lost all my cars after playing for weeks opened app and game reset and lost all my progress
Very bad game whenever I am trying to download high and ultra graphics it's inable to do that why I am giving 1 star and I am playing this game from so many years
"This game sucks. 1: too many adds. 2: Controlling! U press straight, and suddenly you veer if of because straight isn't straight. 3: Maps. Traffic mode is really annoying, so I play in freemode. But I recently switched tablets and I restarted the game little while ago, and it sucks now. I have to get points to go in Freemode, but when I crash into something or stop, I lose all my points. And, well, I crash a lot because there is no straight, so it's impossible. I do not recommend this game."
"This game is the worst! This game doesn't even have realistic crash physics, this game also didn't save my data when i accidently deleted! I had like 600 km and all cars and now i lost all of my progress! I logged in the game with my Google Play account but still didn't save! The game also shows too much ads and the products (Pay to win items) cost way too much! I am never going to ever play this game again! I don't recommend you to download this bad game!"
The game is amazing but I will like it more if they have no more low graphics because every time I get in the game it goes to low graphics and l keep on turning it on and it just goes back to low graphics. Please ðð fix that issue. And the lag .
Game starting problem. To much loading. Loading loading nevar start game only loading....ð¤¬ð¡
"Every time i press everywhere, ad pops up..."
0/5 star because you dont understand how to properly place your ads. too many for starters most importantly they cant cover main features of the game. also pick one either banner there for ads 24/7 or 5 ads per minute not both i wish i didn't have to give a star to rate but you NEED to fix this game so its playable as another game developer this is irritating so im going to play another game and uninstall after 20 minutes. do better man
"This isn't a game. The graphics are sooo good but the ads come on, every 10 seconds you get an anoying ad."
Terrible it never say we needed fricking data to play!!!!!and then when i on my data it says no connection!!!honestly i would rate it a big fat zero if i could.im deleting this game.
"Ad in extreme, no any appropriate task behind de game, Boring"
A lot of ads can't playð¤ª but game is goodâ­
i like this game very much and love his graphics control there is so big map cars speedððð
"Used to be amazing, the latest update that changed the UI forces ads very frequently, if you even want to go into the settings menu an ad plays every single time. They've removed the car handling controls and only left traction control. Now it's just like every other cash grab, un-fun, generic car game, and unfortunately due to that I've chosen to uninstall it. Extremely disappointing, as it used to be one of my favourite games."
Very very bad game because too many ads and very gliches so I give 1 star to this game â¹ï¸â¹ï¸ð¡ð¡
"I get ads when I want to pause the game, what is this?"
"My kid made a total of 4 purchases in this game. Support team said they will refund for me via email. But nothing, althought i send alot of remind emails. It's lie so bad."
This is so bad game after update. I donât want to spend mony in this game. Before update i have all cars. Donât wont to play rhis game. Bye bye extreme car driving stimulator
Terrible just terrible I hate bad in every way say this is helpful so they can acknowledge this and change there game
My Experience with this game was very bad this game hangs everytime in my device
this is not a game but this is real game because real feeling game thank you for exterme car making
There should be stearing Wheel sensitivity option.
I have a headache when I use the cyber truck because it sounds like a washing machine. Everything else is fine and could you add multiplayer plz.
"I expected more... First of all, The graphics still suck in 2023, The cars are turning too fast and the physics are not even close to the real ones and the crashing is worse, the game still has low quality textures/models. What should you do : -better camera mode - licensed cars with logo - named cars ( e.x : porsche 911 gtr ) - show car top speed, horsepower, torque and telemetry Instead removing the cars, make them new and not replacing the others - better car customization - high quality etc."
All is right but the problem is that it's not like it's so small place and the scars are so speed and you can make the game realistic and we can fly planes and multiplayer lack gta 5
This game is awesome? It's amazing to play this game it's awesome today it's amazing today Awesomest cars ever even even upgrade and XP. That's awesome as car error. Best car app. Best car ever I like this game you morrow imara imara immeral
"I don't like the update because I used to play this game so much when I was younger and I see this game now but I noticed that the game is different. It looks smoother, newer, and just over drifting by just turning. I miss the old graphics so much because it used to look cooler and awesome. Some games just don't need an update and just stay how they are when they were old.."
Too many adds and how is my top speed 198MPH when the starter car aka a corvette it's top speed is 205MPH so this game is not realistic and the deformation is trash crash into a car it's just a dent
If you do not want ads turn off data and wifi
When I buy the pack of cars in offer zone and I buy the Rs 17500 pack and I go to my car collection and I check the car that in the offer it is not unlocked l had been heard because I am thinking about that when I have 17500 rs but stil nice . At the end I am telling you to fix this problem and it is 90 out of 100 . Thanks
Way too many adverts and he keeps stopping to update itself when you're playing it and it's got star things where you can't reach them
This game literally sucks it's so expensive almost everything costs money and you have a commercial break every minute and a half I wouldn't recommend this game
"whoever made this game knows nothing about cars. when the car is going 300 kmh it feels like its going 100kmh. Also when you dont accelerate the car slows down so fast like its braking. Also please remove the passport checking thing its not realistic and / or cool in any way. The ""Mega Skins"" Are Stupidly Expensive too. The map is too small. Theres Not Many Cars. Terrible Game. Wouldnt recommend it ever. 0/10"
I like the game the graphics and the cars but I just want you to take it to the next level like a person holding the steering wheel and people walking around the city
I hate that you have to buy a car in every single car has the same interior
Deleted the game the ads banner is bigger than my phone not playable
says its made for chrome but game keeps crashing
Game is not good ð¤¬ð¡ð¡I buy all car and VIP also My Father say deleat all game next day i installed game my all progress is not there no VIP.
This game is good but high graphics is not dowload
They're name is good extreme game i love it and plz add mclaern 720s
This is very much ad's ð Don 't install this app ok
You need to download more after installing the game to get better graphics
I think you have to make this game multiplayer but i like this game
very bad i make money in three days for a car and i buy it then i saw now its not there
"This used to be a very good game. Look at it now, it is just another Pay2Win Free2Play, with only 26 cars, while Asphalt 8 has 300+ vehicles. Also, this game boasts complete customization, when we lost out on the color wheel. We used to have over 200 million color choices, now we only get to choose from 10 colors. And worst of all, we can't put body kits on our cars. JUST PATHETIC. Do not waste your time in this game. It's ruined like Asphalt 8 and 9. Forza Horizon 5 is more worth your time."
"I don't know if this a problem for the phone I'm currently using or what. But I used to play this game along time ago when it was early access and I enjoyed it alot. When I re-download it just now I couldn't get to driving because the add that comes before it is zoomed I to much making it impossible to close it after it had finished. I tried everything backspacing with the buttons on the bottom of my phone, downloading the app in question and then coming back, reopening the app... nothing."
"Offers little to nothing in terms of gameplay, the map is tiny and bland, there are no races and you can't even use your own cars when it comes to challenges, adding to the pointlessness of the tuning aspect (a selection of 10 colors and 9 wheels). This game is passable as a student homework project but not something that you're expected to spend 100s of hours playing and/or paying literally 100s of $$$ for. Ridiculous."
THERE ARE SO MANY ADS!!! Its crazy!! And when you're in-game it's really annoying when an ad just pops up every minute!! I understand that as a free game you have to have some ads but this amount of ads is unacceptable. You can hardly even play the game!!
Stupid update. Who gives a banner add right below the controls? Dont be so greedy to earn money that you completely end up destroying the experience.
"Edit:Worst game ever! Last year I had given it a 4-star rating.Consider this before downloading the game- 1. The controls are so bad-As soon as you turn, you crash. You crash more than you drive. 2. The developers should remove EXTREME from it's title. I've never seen a game as boring as this one! You just keep going and going and going. No timelines, no races. 3. So many ADS,that this game holds a record.A ad after every action. 4. Weird graphics- When the car crashes, it looks so unrealistic!"
The game is good at graphics and all but there are lot of mistakes at airport in traffic mode the cars are always crashing at parking point and the board of offroad at airport the cars there are jumping and there should be a multiplayer mode also so that we can play with friends. I am very disappointed after the update so these all mistakes need should be fixed very soon.
"Too many adds. If there were less adds then my review would be different. I couldn't do anything without an add popping up. It really made me mad...but what little time I got to play, it was amazing. Good graphics and everything. Please romove all the extra adds."
"The controls are so lousy, this game deserves a one-star. Why don't devs use touch for analog? Would it make their games too darn easy to play and master? Then they should make more complex, challenging games without artificially handicapping players with controls that are only suited to physical, tactile joypads. The PS1 was probably the last console with controllers that lacked analog joysticks and touch is ideal for analog! The only thing ""extreme"" about this ""simulator"" is how annoying it is"
"I would give -10 stars if it was possible. When I reached out for help to remove the split screen view, I was immediately told the issue was resolved, and then the conversation was blocked. It must be my imagination. Yet not everyone has been forced into the split screen view. I've asked around, and it seems only SOME of us were targeted for the split screen punishment. This ""improvement"" is a great way for whatsapp to thin out the herd and remove their pesky customers."
"Worked excellent until the past update. When i try to share a video, it only sends 1 second of it. The ability to share videos quickly was the biggest selling point of the app. Without that, theres no point in using this app. Message apps are a dime a dozen. Fix the video upload issue, there are plenty of apps that do the same thing. Now I have to get everyone to jump ship"
"I absolutely loathe this app. If it weren't for the fact that a group I belong to uses it for communication I would uninstall. Seemed to be no way to install without making it the default messging app, although I somehow got around that. It imported my contacts without permission. It wanted my phone number to send me a verification code, but then it skipped over the input screen. Real secure. And it makes noise when it notifies me even though I have tried to turn that off every way I could."
"A terrible and totally untrustworthy app. These permanent updates make things worse and worse and deliver nothing useful at all. Just freezing the app, making it impossible to add new contacts, and the display constantly going black. And that constant pop-up box: ""close the app"" , ""wait"", ""send feedback"". And when trying to connect to the computer: ""No valid QR code detected"". Developers: these are your QR codes, not mine. Horrible. Thank god there is Signal. A much better app."
"Split screen, and can't be turned off. This is awful. Like, I have vision issues AND sensory processing issues. A single case of ADHD makes this layout AWFUL to deal with for even a few minutes. If someone wants to toggle IN to such a feature because they do multiple chats at once, time. But it's just not only unimportant for most users , it renders Whatsapp nearly unusable for some of us. Think about accessibility issues - for neurodivergent users, various disabilities, older users, etc. Fail."
"It answers calls by itself when using earphones!!!! So if I'm listening to music, or i have a Bluetooth speaker connected, it answers any call without my noticing or any ringing. If you guys are going to add a hands-free feature, at least add a switch so we can turn it on or off!! It is getting me in trouble!"
"Went from 5 stars to 1. The split screen is an awful idea and truly hideous. It looks so cluttered and I don't even want to use it anymore. Looks like a hoarder's dream. Honestly, I have no clue why anyone would think this was a good idea. Don't fix things that aren't broken. Also, cant slide messages to reply to them anymore. That was the best feature of Whatsapp and the reason I chose this app over texting and other apps. Please reverse this hideous idea or give an option to return to normal."
"For whatever reason, devs refuse to offer an option to reject messages from numbers not in my contact list. The end result of this refusal is incessant spam from random unknown numbers from all over the world. I also have reason to believe they scan your messages for keywords to report back to Facebook for ad targeting. I've had it happen multiple times that I've been discussing a topic with a friend only to have ads start showing up on Facebook just a few minutes later. Get Signal instead."
It worked fine for awhile but now my husband can't even download the app on his phone and when I try to call or video chat someone on the app it won't allow me to unmute. I have checked all settings in my phone and allowed video and microphone but they still can't heat me. My friend is in Europe for the next couple of years and we are still trying to figure out how I can talk to him other than through text message. Everything tells me to Uninstaller and reinstall but I'm afraid if I do it won't
"Horrible. My name and number are listed correctly in the Settings, but the app has assigned a random name from my contacts to my number in Contacts. If I go to Contacts, I see my picture, my number but the name is someone else's. There is no way to fix this. I have been trying to get support for over 3 months and there is no support. There is only a chat bot which returns random information totally unrelated to my issue."
"Love the app but starting to get annoyed at all the false notifications due to backup paused or even backup complete. I don't care if the backup is complete, that is what it is meant to do. The dismiss button doesn't work and on lock screen I can't tell the difference between a message and the notification. Please add settings to disable notifications about backup!"
"After updating to the latest version of this app,I cant download voice notes, videos, pictures,my videos,pictures,files and other documents no longer delivers. At first I thought it's data but even after subscribing it's still the same. It's frustrating,I only send typed messages. I can't listen to group voice note anymore cause I can't download them no matter what!! Please treat as urgent!"
"The recent updates suck! 1. Sending videos as documents is frustrating for me now since I can't cancel the process when I need to. You'll have to send the entire video (large size for me) first then delete afterwards. Allow users to cancel sending files. 2. It is taking even longer to send files that usually took seconds before this recent update (April) 3. You can no longer send multiple files like before. I selected more than 10 songs to send but when I pressed send, only one was sent."
"I absolutely hate the split screen. The reason I use this app on my tablet is because the text is easier to read, but now it looks exactly the same size as a phone screen. I don't know if the app developers ever read the feedback but if you do PLEASE undo this totally unnecessary update! It is definitely not an improvement."
"Of course WA is great to use... if you can actually get to use it. My previous phone's screen died. So when I tried to migrate my account to the new phone, WA sent a verification code to my previous phone. You can see my problem... Then, when I try to contact support, it keeps giving me stupid options, of which none cover my issue and that seems to be the end of the line. I can't get a message sent, because the next step is to send a screenshot when the problem is not on the new phone! Idiotic!"
"A great messaging app and more. The issue I have with the app is that, backing up chat can take forever, and one doesn't know the stage (percentage) in the process of the backing up that one is until it has really wasted one's precious time. I think there should be a bar (like a download bar) that'll indicate the process, maybe in the notification or on the app itself. It's frustrating."
"The latest update is awful. I have a small tablet and the split screen view is pointless. Messages are awkward to read in a narrow, long column. Contacts are permanently on view for anyone else to see, why? I cannot enlarge pictures to full screen. You used to be able to swipe a message right and reply to it. This was especially useful with group chats to avoid confusion. Why has this gone? PLEASE at least give us an option to disable the split screen and bring back the swipe right to reply"
"Was very simple and easy to use, however with the new update, the split screen is absolutely horrible and there is no option to disable it. Makes the system very complicated and frustrating to use. Please revert back to the old layout as this is very off putting. Very dissatisfied and disappointed."
"I used the app for years on my tablet (I have no smartphone, only a tablet with SIM card) with no problems. But a few days ago, the layout changed into 2 columns. I have tried going back to the older and better view, but cannot find the option. Just found out it was caused by the latest update and other people are angry as well. If this change lasts without the option to disable it, I will not continue to use the app because it is now very annoying and complicated to use."

The split screen version of the app on fold 4 is annoying. bought a big screen phone for a better experience. Not to struggle to read. It would be better you have an option to choose the normal screen or the split screen. There is a saying don't fix it if it's not broken and you just did that killed all the fun for a big screen phone.
The new split view on my Samsung tablet is horrible. If some people want or like it there needs to be the option to choose the previous full screen view. I use WhatsApp daily and was very happy with it. Now it looks cluttered and confusing. I do not want to see all my contacts and messages when I am reading or sending a message to one of my contacts.
"I'm very satisfied with this application all this years of using. However, recently the software has changed the format of its display. The display has gone 2 columns and making the view to be small. This was done to phones and tablet folds. It's annoying. I bought Samsung fold to have a bigger display not to be squinting my eyes on ridiculously small writing,it's even smaller than ordinary phones. Preset it back to original display. Thanks."
"This App is slowly losing its integrity as a reliable tool. Phone call quality is poor. Messaging has degraded. I can't see it lasting much longer now that Facebook has control of it, they are slowly destroying Facebook with all the suggestions that have no bearing on user location or interests. Sad really. I queried an issue with messaging and they needed my mobile number before they could deal with it. Why? Surely that compromises the encryption protocols."
"Used to be great but now issues here and there. I have 2 issues I need your team to fix. 1. I can no longer send multiple documents, it selects just one and send. So inconvenient and slow. 2. When I play a video on status and leave, it keeps playing on the background. Please fix this issue."
"My WhatsApp shows dates completely wrong and I tried all the possible ways such as reinstalling it, change my phone date and time setting and everything and still doesn't work. Also when I put Status it disappears after like 10 minutes and I don't know what to do with this much problem I got with it. It's ofcourse updated to the last version from Google play. I sent message to the Help and they just randomly answered something completely irrelevant to my problem. I'm really disappointed."
"Nowadays, the wtsapp is not user-friendly. To open itself, it will take a lot of time, even though after opening the wtsapp, the mgs will not get loaded. If I check later some time, I can see the mgs from prior time beforehand, which I checked. Even photos are not getting shared over the wtsapp . I can see the photos, but after clicking on the send button, it's not sending. Also, I did a uninstall and reinstalled it, but still, the issue is persisting. Please get this resolved ASAP."
I've been using WhatsApp for years now. However the latest update doesn't allow me to send/share multiple documents at a time. I've selected several files but only one file is being sent. hope the team could do something about this. It has caused inconvenience to me and perhaps to many other users too.
"The new forced preview pane that came with the latest update is absolute trash. The view is terribly cluttered, and now whoever has a sight line to my phone display is also able to view the contacts I've recently been messaging. This isn't a concern for most people, but I have a Samsung Fold so my screen is huge and visible to anyone within 3 feet of me. Pls give us the option to remove the preview pane and go back to the full screen"
"Restrictive. Honestly it is one of the most unfriendly messaging apps out there. I had such a difficult time trying to transfer my whatdapp data from iPhone to samsung (in fact still unable to) compared to othee messaging apps which took me less than 5 minutes to set up. In addition, the destop version has no call function. In the past you need to have you phone nearby before you can even log into the desktop version (this has improved). But the data still takes a few minutes to load every time"
"Whatsapp has been a great messaging app for years. But, it has changed with its new update where it dropped the alpha version of the split screen on tablets - it has been terrible. To start, it has been uncomfortable to get used to, and has been less efficient to use despite its intended effects. Not only that, but when I reply to a message via quoting (and I type the quoted message) it doesn't send me back to the original message, and becomes a hassle to scroll back up manually. Please fix."
"New auto interface ratio update for tablets is counter intuitive. Makes the apps harder to read and use in portrait layout, even some icons are cropped and out of bounds. While using it in landscape isnt good either since the interface is similar with WhatsApp desktop but the user experience is way different in practical sense. Built in apps display settings needs to be added for better preferences in phones and tablets or just reverts back to the old full screen display."
Everything was fine until the recent update as I am unable to forward a video from a message directly to status. Usually I was able to put status (if file size below 16mb) just by taping the forward icon next to the video file without compromising the quality. The only way left now is by going to status>select video>share and the drawback is it that WhatsApp will compress it to ~6 mb which drastically changes the overall quality. Please help.
"So lately my voice note has developed issues , it works sometimes and stops whenever it pleases I thought it was lack of storage but no it's a bug from the WhatsApp app I don't know how you guys can fix it because I won't hesitate to leave WhatsApp for good, I can't even view status ,receive, or send pictures or videos to anyone, making me look like a loner please I want the bugs fixed as soon as possible because I use my WhatsApp to work ........... Thank you"
"I've been facing ""reconnecting"" issue for a long time. Whenever I receive or make a call, 1st thing that appears, is reconnecting and then voice breakdown starts. It happens time and again during every call. That makes me hard to have a conversation with anyone. I would like to request to resolve this issue. I'm unable to have a conversation with anyone while the issue is there."
"Old fashioned inconvenient messenger. However it is the same as Facebook. It is not possible to write to a person until adding to your contact list. It is not possible to send a big file. No stickers, emojis are redrawed for no reason. I hope once developers will realize that it is 2023 already ""Couldn't complete backup"" notification couldn't be closed and it uses your google disk. Reptiloids have to do perfect apps as a more perfect stage of evolution"
"Screen permanently split after update. Contacted ""customer support"" 3 times, explaining I'm getting eye strain from trying to read the 50% smaller chat screens; i can't make them Full-screen anymore. I got an auto AI response each time, then ticket auto-closed, each time, with no resolution, no info on whether i will ever hear back, or if there will be any follow up, or how to fix the screen. Not sure what to do..."
"My one star rating is for the latest update with the split screen. Why sacrifice half of my screen real estate to view contacts? I want to see my messages full screen again please. The split screen is not an improvement, in my opinion. If you must leave it there, please give me the option to turn it off. This update has caused me to switch off automatic updates! ð"
"The rate at which you are banning numbers from WhatsApp is getting annoying. One will email your support team to rectify the problem but never gets a response back. Even when one hasn't gone against any standards. Again, After marking several documents to send to a particular person it only sends one, meaning you have send each of the document one after the other."
"I had to rewrite my review and drop my rating becuase of this, the update on the Huawei mediapad is absolutely terrible, i got a huge tablet to have an easy time reading and a bigger screen to enjoy messaging, but now there's this unnecessary split screen view which is terrible, annoying and filled with bugs, since the update, i have been unable to highlight messages and do other important things. At least make it an option to turn on or off or better still just remove it."
Since today I am not able to send multiple photos as document format at a time. It only sends the first photo and all the rest i selected are left. Also there's an issue with the status. When my contacts uploads status it is not available or visible in the status option but in the chats. I have to search them individually in order to view their status... Kindly look into this issue and fix this as soon as possible. My phone is one plus Nord 2
I hate the split screen! It's just a sensory overload to see all contacts and partial chats on one screen. I function better just to view one chat at a time. Please allow people a choice of the classic screen or split screen. Oddly enough my elderly mum still has classic screen - she found the split screen on my phone too overwhelming.
"The split screen feature for big screen owners, like myself ( who uses a tablet ) is a big problem as it's not comfortable to use. Need to add a disable option for that feature. I use WhatsApp on my tablet because of its large screen, I didnt sign up for a split screen. This option is being pushed onto us, BY FORCE. Please provide a disable option for this split screen problem."
"The recent split view gets a thumbs down from me. The right chatting panel screen was way smaller than b4. I purposely use a fold phone to have larger screens, but now it seems the screen viewing now is ever much smaller. Worst, there is no button to change it back to the previous full screen view. Get this fix up developer. Thanks."
The new split view on my Samsung tablet is horrible. If some people like it there is a needs to have the option to choose the previous full screen mode/ view. I use WhatsApp daily and was very happy with it but now it looks cluttered and confusing. I dont want to see all my contacts and messages when am reading or sending message to of my contacts.
"The call quality couldn't be worse on wireless headsets, same issues with Facebook and Instagram calls - the background noise is more prominent than the person who speaks. The speaker's voice is partly cancelled. It seem the opposite should be done - cancelling the background noise and optimising the speaker's voice. Please could you test the call function using Bluetooth before you release your next update?"
"It takes forever to backup. The lat time I backed up was April 28th, 2023 (I use the option of ONLY BACK UP WHEN I CLICK BACKUP, and I haven't been able to back up again afterwards. It just shows backing up and keeps booting but it will be there for hours until I switch off my phone. I would have deletedbtue app and reinstalled but I don't want to lose any of my chats. It's saddening. Blessing"
"The update is extremely stupid and crippling, and only adds to the difficulty in browsing.. I cannot stay on the application for more than a few seconds. The display of the screen without the content must be enabled, as was the situation in the application before this very bad update"
The noise it makes while making a call is irritating. Get a softer alternative sound. Something safe for the ears. And make delete for everyone last forever. Its not too much to ask. And can your app have some common sense to upload statuses in the order i sent them? Its already stupid enough not to be able to chop up the video into 30 second segments. So i get that done. And i upload the videos but it changes the order. Now the video doesn't make sense for the viewer. $#&+
The new update for my Samsung Tab S8 with keyboard cover make the screen looks cropped on the part we type the message and this happened if I enter DeX Mode.. The previous version didn't show this problem. Please fix this WhatsApp. Thank you Update: problems still exist and those really annoy me. I use my Tab S8 a lot for my work and the layout seems not perfect for the Samsung DeX mode. Please make things right!
"Since past few days I am not able to send multiple documents at a time. I select multiple documents to share but when I send it, only one document is being sent. WhatsApp ruined its own user experience by the latest update! I would like to see a positive response from WhatsApp and I shall wait WhatsApp to fix this issue as soon as possible. Thank you."
"1) I make calls(without internet) using earpod and it's usually clear, but on WhatsApp the receiver will never hear what I'm saying. Makes me feel like my earpod is bad but it's not. 2) Stop playing videos immediately after I stop viewing a status. 3) Now I can't send multiple files like before using the ""DOCUMENT"" option. When you fix these, please give a feedback so I can update. Regards."
"The split screen feature for big screen owners, like myself (who uses a tablet) is a big problem as it's not comfortable to use. Need to add a disable option for that feature. I use WhatsApp on my tablet because of its large screen, I didnt sign up for a split screen. This option is being pushed onto us. BY FORCE. Please provide a disable option for this split screen problem."
"Took me years to accept using this thing because I really disliked the contacts management policy. I eventually installed it and despite WhatsApp promise, contacts upload is NOT optional. There's no setting to disable contacts upload, only an Android setting to disable contacts sync, which the app switches back on without notice. Another thing which is still unchanged is the inability to use an SD card as the default storage. For an app that stores everything local, this really drives me mad!"
"Started bogging me with backup encryption password all the time... If I try to turn off end-to-end encryption then it threatens me that my backup will become unencrypted. I am not making backups. There is probably still a backup on Google drive. Will it become unencrypted? I do not understand this. Ask ne for backup passwords when I am making a backup, not everytime I open the app."
"I am unable to upload my selfie from gallery. When I try to change profile picture, in the All Photos section, it shows all photos except the ones taken from my phone or selfies from my phone. I have to save the photos that I want to use as Profile pictures in a different folder for it to reflect as an option there to choose it. This is very tedious. Please work on the issue."
"It's 2023 and we still don't have multi device support. Such a shame. And the web version doesn't work properly in mobile browser (dekstop mode on). For the first time it works then when trying to open again it redirects to the download page. Instead of adding this feature, devs are adding gimmicks. One of the most popular messaging apps and it feels like outdated pice of trash."
"Since they rolled out a SPLIT VIEW in tablets and a larger screen android phone , it's a total disaster. Reasons for larger screen were to read and view vids without out opening or enlarging screens . The update was done with no option to revert back to previous or opp out . Read on Redit with all the people say with Z flip phones and tablets. TIME TO SWITCH !!!!"
"Very unreliable. Massive issues changing phones, have lost all my conversations history once before, changing phones and numbers is a nightmare. Most recently changing phones and numbers crashed my brand new phone. Now it will not even open. Have lost all my conversation history multiple times. Have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times and now it just crashes everytime I try to open the app. Won't let me even try to use it. No response from support either."
"1) Not sure why but lately WA notification goes silent including calls!. No power saver, no sleep app for WA and its randomly no sound/notification. All basic such as reboot, reinstall, reset sound setting has been done but no avail. The popup appear without sound sometime but most of the time is silent. All others app notification working fine and pretty sure something not right with WA. 2) Cannot send multiple docs, it will randomly pick one docs to send after selected."
"It is quite pellucid that the new update (The split screen) is receiving a surplus of vitriol from the general public. The new update is sincerely tempting me to delete the app. It makes using the app quite mundane, which I think will be a big deficit on the behalf of your company. So if the respective administrative could revert the update back to the full screen effect, that would be really nice."
"This version ain't that bad, but I don't understand why some useful and reasonable features were eliminated from the version. The likes of filtering picture(s) before uploading on status, and the back up too lasts like forever."
What used to be a good app has become a security risk with ample spammers and scammers and very minimal ways to protect yourself. You can't even block people without opening a message and you have to automatically accept calls from everyone even people you don't know. They can just spam you as much as they want and there's no way to block them from the call list directly. At this point I'm probably just going to uninstall and never look back.
"Mic access being used CONSTANTLY in the background. I have screenshots of the usage. Reinstalled app, force closed, even revoked permission and it is still showing as using my mic. I shouldn't have to block my mic to keep you from using it. Pixel 6 running LATEST Whatsapp version and my phone is updated too. Fix the issue!"
"When I changed the time setting on my phone from 24-hour to 12-hour, WhatsApp messed up and started showing me very weird timestamps (2:43 in the afternoon, 9:04 in the morning). Why ? Why can't it just show the time with AM or PM ? This is so ugly and takes up a lot of space on the screen. Furthermore, the separator between chats in the home view takes up the whole screen horizontally, and that's very ugly. I restarted my phone, cleared the app cache/data but these problems persist."
"Team, for some reason I had to reinstall my WhatsApp by uninstalling. After uninstalling, all the data which I have downloaded (media files) got deleted from my phone internal storage. Why did my phone internal storage data of WhatsApp got deleted, I have many photos, pdf docs and links which are all erased. Please help me to recover the data."
"Lately i have issues with the bluetooth connection. When i received a call and i wanted to connect to my bluetooth devices, i can't even press the bluetooth icon on WhatsApp. Which is my bluetooth already connected to my phone but only on WhatsApp can't connect. Please fix that issue."
"The new split screen is awful and you can't toggle it off or move the split left. Your chats are now only half the screen size meaning images are very small so you now have to open them most of the time and text lines are very short, which makes reading more awkward on long messages. I have a wide GalaxyZ fold 3 and it must be even worse on narrower phones."
"All of a sudden I can't send videos. I keep getting an error message telling me to restart my phone. I tried everything, even uninstalled WhatsApp and reinstalled after 4 hours of backups. Still same issue."
"I used to send pictures to my customers as documents, I used to send up to 30 pictures of more than 100mb, but after I updated my WhatsApp today, I just tried sending 13 pictures as document to someone, after selecting all, immediately I click select, it will pick just one, and it doesn't happen like this before... This is very bad"
"I had a whatsapp account but, now that I try to put in a different phone with the same number I haven't been able to get the code to access it. I have contacted customer support and I followed their steps but, with no success. Every time I request a code it doesn't get delivered and it takes 1hr to get another which is very odd. I am very disappointed with this service. They always send same auto reply solution which I tried many times. This is the third day without whatapp access. Disappointed."
"what is wrong with the whatsapp support? it's like the worst automated support ever. your customer support system is utterly incompetent. it would be more beneficial if you were to discontinue it altogether, as it serves no purpose other than to aggravate people. (btw my problem is since the last update, i haven't been able to access my sticker pack. It's telling me that I need to turn off my phone's battery saving mode, but even if I do, I still can't access it.)"
There is a current issue when my screen goes black and becomes unresponsive when i get a call or listen to a voice message. If the person on the other side hangs up the screen turns back on otherwise it remains unresponsive And sometimes when hearing a voice message the screen goes black and never turns back on. Please fix this issue.
"I like this app for messaging only. However when I want to share video of more than 16mb size, this app doesn't allow. This sucks. Perhaps Pro version should be introduced where the above mentioned issue is resolved. I don't mind paying for such Pro version if introduced. My request to friends out there. Do you know of any Apps which allows larger sized video to transfer via the messaging apps."
"I should not be forced to update the app. Everything worked as I needed it to, I didn't need an update. But then I get forced to update it anyway, and everything starts being glitchy. Lost half my chat history, it says there are stories to view when there aren't, app now closes etc... This update is a joke"
"The previous version was good, but the updated one is not as good, some of the useful features are removed inorder to add some useless features, also the layout of old version was much better, new one is not likeable. It would be better if they give back all the removed features and change the layout back like it was in the old version."
"From 3 days ago the video lenght that can be recorded inside the chats, using WhatsApp Camera, dropped to 26 seconds. The previous cap of 1:26 was already too short, you could drop the feature entirely, tbh. Couldn't find any setting to make the videos longer and it's definitely not a storage issue as there's plenty of free space. Disappointing."
"Why only a 3 star rating, when it is one of the dominant messaging apps? Because it isn't secure, irrespective of the end to end encryption it claims to employ. It is great that only admins can see certain changes, but admins should decide if a group needs disappearing messages or not. Indeed, it should not be possible for a hacker to take over another person's account !! I have received messages from people who didn't send them, many times...this is an identity issue and needs to be fixed ASAP"
"The 2 panel layout is such a nightmare.I have a Samsung Z Fold 4 and using whatsapp now is a pain. Scrolling down the starred messages is another task altogether.I dont see the point in split view.I do not know of any other app that goes ahead and worsens the user experience and makes negative changes.On reaching out to them asking for the split panel view to be atleast made optional,they say they cant do it and decided for themselves that the issue has been resolved. Would give -100 if I could"
Delayed notification of messages and calls. I get notification of messages 5 minutes after its sent. And I just get notifications of missed calls 2 minutes after the call which didnt ring my phone. Idk if im the only one experiencing this. It's annoying. I hope it can be fix soon.
Too many problems are happening nowadays. First of all we can't share multiple photos at a time in document format. Secondly it becomes a little unstable as compared to previous. Solve this issue as soon as possible otherwise we have to uninstall this.
the online display will still be visible when I'm not in the chat and sometimes I'm blue-tick someone or double-tick when I'm already off my phone. This app glitches sometimes and the video calls sometimes can't do the thing with the camera. When my camera is automatically off when I'm sending pictures I can't opened it back up.
The recent update is totally horrible. People using a tablet like me cannot use it properly. The split is useless. Earlier the usage was much more convenient and the there is no slide to reply option. Please fix this. This is becoming extremely difficult to use what's app now.
"Since the last couple of days, I've been facing this issue. Whatsapp is allowing me to share multiple images as a doc, but when we select images, it shows only one image in the Preview before sending. What's going on!! Please fix it asap. Thanks"
In this new update you give an option to create avatar but when I started to try this option I get a bug please fix this. The bug is that when started to create avatar and select the skin tone and click on next then the screen goes for loading after waiting for minutes it wouldn't load. That's why I rate it one star.
"'Disappearing message after 7 day' make me lost all important job related message. You should only set this option available to admin only, or just to that user who want to auto delete their message. This option affect everyone in a WhatsApp group. Why? People can easily change the setting and even make my company argue with each other about disabling or enabling the setting. These people turn on and off message each hour as if they are on passive aggressive relationship."
"Everything's good have been using this app for years now but recently i have started facing problems in documents sending , as i used to send multiple pictures and videos in document form but now I can only send 1 pic at a time, it's frustrating and time consuming.. please FIX IT !!"
Don't like this version. It doesn't let you move onto the next line and I accidentally / muscle memory hit the send button of half a sentence that doesn't make sense most of the time. The previous version was better for messaging.
"My microphone isn't working, which is weird cause I can still make phone calls, just not whatsapp calls because the person I'll be talking to won't hear me. I've tried a lot of tricks in the past week alone to get this fixed, but it's a problem that's only affecting this app, and that's a bummer"
Not sure why you haven't updated the app to make sure videos and photos which are sent can just be viewed without downloading onto your phones gallery. Seems so stupid. Looking online for solutions to this for Android users and it seems the issue was raised 6+ years ago so your company clearly doesn't care about fixing this.
"I am facing proble when sharing files via WhatsApp documents. I am selecting multiple files for share, but when I tap to send, it's just send only One file. That is horrible experience. I read some review that people like me faces, I am concerned about. Fix this problem. Whatsapp is missing a feature. ""Screen Share"" option should be added to whatsapp as like as Facebook"
"After the last update I have faced some issues. 1) After I select several photos to send as a document and click the ""select"" button to send them, ONLY ONE document is being sent. This is so annoying because it is not always easy to find and select the necessary documents."
"Camera says file format not compatible or something so I can't send pictures. Pictures from gallery also refuse to send. And now after I just updated, the drawing tool is inaccurate and goes above where you draw with your finger. And the camera and gallery issues are still there. Please fix, needed for university ASAP Update: now it doesn't let me change my profile picture after updating ð ð I'm on android - FIX IT PLS Update 3 May 2023 - been months still can't send pics ð"
Please remove the split screen feature or else make it optional on tablet because it's very difficult and disturbing to use this feature as it divides the screen into two parts this is pathetic and I have raised this issue earlier also but still no action has been taken by you and this is the worst feature I have ever experienced on this platform.
"This is where Telegram app is way better & more reliable! This app now don't recognize most of my numbers like I didn't save them at all! Only shows the numbers. These affected all my favorite contacts, etc. The app is now asking me to allow calling etc like I have reinstalled or installed the app on a new phone which i did not do. I have updated the app, my Android OS is updated, I restarted several times but still the same. This app always face challenges somehow."
"Terrible connection despite good bandwidth of wifi, keeps going on reconnect all the time, in the past, this was never the case, but every now and then in the middle of the call it keeps showing reconnecting which is very annoying while talking."
"on miui 12.5.10 whatsapp has some major bugs: * Im unable to send multiple items (imgs, docs, etc) at once, even if I select them all, it only sends the first one. * im unable to send imgs, or download voice notes, tho this only happens with some contacts. Stock miui, brand new phone, havent touched any app/battery settings Cleared cache, but havent reset data or reinstalled whatsapp yet, im hoping the issues would be fixed soon"
I changed my phone type and all my stickers just disappeared !!!!! And afrer downloaging my backup several times no stickers are backed up and the app keeps crashing and showing that message saying you have a problem with your messages and you can restore them now after restoring I only get empty groups !!!!!!!
"Worst update ever on the note of multiple selection of documents, that gives very negative program which selected as multiple and sending as one on one, need to improve on multiple selection mode for mainly documents category, every time need Select one bye one, if you guyss are free ,we are not like that strictly you need to update every category programs."
"WhatsApp ist always using the Microphone on my Pixel 7 Pro, the green dot indicating microphone use is always on. If i turn microphone permission off it disappears, but as soon as I activate it it appears again, even if WhatsApp is closed. I don't know whether it's actually listening but this needs to be fixed either way!"
"The app doesn't allow to cancel the paid subscription. I have written the request to the customer service and they have never responded. One more thing. Telegram can block your account forever, with no reason and without any explanation whatsoever. Customer service is of course not accessible. So you lose all your contacts, records, conversations etc. That is what happened to me."
"The latest update has RUINED this app. It's nearly unusable. I've been putting off making the transition to TRUTH social, but this latest update is going to make the change much easier. Videos don't load, constantly lagging and the settings constantly reset...so you get interrupted every 5 seconds w/notifications regardless of preferences. Obnoxious."
I love this app but the latest update has A HUGE bug! Some video messages go to the music category and they play whilst listening to music! And you can't skip them! Like imagine listening to music on shuffle then suddenly hearing your own voice. So annoying. My main use of telegram was listening to music now it's ruined. Please fix this. Many of my friends have this problem as well.
"The new reactions are being pushed way too hard. Double clicking on any message makes me accidentally react to it now and every time I select a message it takes longer to open because of the animated reaction menu. I want to be able to disable reactions entirely. The more updates that are pushed, the more buggy and bloated that this app gets. It won't even open correctly for me after the last update. I started using this app because it was lightweight and reliable for text and image sharing..."
"Telegram used to be hands down the most amazing messaging platform. In recent months the Android release has gone from hero to zero with near-constant crashing, ancillary feature failures all over the place, and messages disappearing and/or flat out failing to send. Whoever is quality checking update roll outs should be let go and whoever is writing this ""code"" should be downright ashamed. It is a complete disgrace."
"The screen goes black while listening to audios even if I don't hold the phone near my ear, AND THERE IS NO OPTIONS TO DISABLE THIS FUNCTION. It's impossible to use the app properly, the screen goes black and I can't do anything until the audio is over. It always happens in one or two seconds after starting listening. Also calls are 4-5 seconds slower, can't even talk to anyone."
"After the update. Now we can go back to downloading only 1 video at a time. This app is also taking too much space (even after clearing the cache & deleting larger files, it bounces back to memory shortage too quickly). Adding, now the downloaded files are gone. Have to download them again. Great. All problems persist. There's been no change at all"
"Don't know what happened to this app. Now the video files are not saving on the device. After the downloading process is completed, I am tapping on the option 'Save to Downloads' and the file is completely re-downloading. Even after updating the app this issue continues. It used to be a great app. Now it has a lot of bugs."
"I don't like the new way the app displays notifications of new messages, after the regular drop down from the top of the screen, which is fine, it goes ahead and bump at my face with a box displaying contents of new messages, while I'm out of the app. This is extremely annoying, everytime a new message comes in, the box appears. Fix this as urgent as possible, this is already making me dislike and if it continues this way, I'd eventually uninstall the app"
"I am just giving one star to grab the developers' attention! After the last update, I am having strange problems. For example, media (photos and videos) and voice messages do not open even though they are fully downloaded. Also, the reactions are greyed out and not visible sometimes. And in one word no matter how fast the network is the media just keep rolling it never complete the downloads please, fix this problem? Let me know how to solve it. Thanks!"
"I loved telegram. It was very useful and convenient. But after the ""Premium"" update, I started facing critical bugs in basic functionalities. In private chats, messages are not displayed for the other person, they just stay only on my side. In general, sending messages quite often just don't work. In messenger! They are just queued and they stay like this forever. And this is not about connection, everything works except telegram. But now we have entertaining features for those who buy premium.."
"Never ending draft messages!!! Ahgh! I'm starting to hate this app. I wrote a message but then ended up deleting it... Now it haunts me in the form of a draft that CANNOT BE DELETED. I've erased it hundreds of times, tried deleting drafts in settings, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, nothing works. I have to delete it every single time I want to send a message."
"Overall the features are really good i love using this over whatsapp. But the most annoying bug I'd like to point out is that the app keeps going into ""Connecting..."" state even when the phone is connected to wifi or mobile data. I have cleared the cache and still the problem persists. The application's experience would improve if this is fixed. (Edit 1) this issue is seen both on android and iOS."
"i can't save any bubble video messages from me or anyone i contact on telegram to my gallery ,instead of it being ""saved to downloads"" it says ""save to music"" but i can't even find where the videos are saved in a music folder in my phone even when I open my files on the app . please fix this, it's really annoying ,all my pictures ,videos are enabled to save to gallery and it's never been touched before so idk why this issue started happening."
"For about the past month whenever I try and video call people they can't see me. I've tried updating, restarting, clearing cache/force stopping, uninstalling/reinstalling. I've done everything to try and get my camera to work for the other side but nothing has worked. All permissions for the app are allowed. I don't know what else to do and it is very frustrating."
"Telegram once was such a great app which now looks half-baked and broken app. If you download file with ""save to download"", it doesn't show up in download folder. So, you go back to Telegram & redownload it & now you see it in your downloads folder. Plus Telegram is only app that has different folders for downloads (it takes system, default download & it's own named folder). Despite disabling reoccurring notifications, notifications in notification panel repeat continuously. Data usage high. ð©"
"This is the app I used the most, I subscribed for Telegram premium but then cancelled, ever since then the app has been having major issues, Can't send multiple files, can't display animated emoji, bots are malfunctioning, Everything works perfect on my desktop app but on the mobile version everything is just messed up, Sad as this used to be my fav app but now it's unreliable"
"This new update is stupid asf. I used to love telegram because I use it for my online classes. With this new update, after downloading a picture or a voice note, in 2 weeks' time if you come back to relisten to the voicenote or open the picture, you'll have to redownload them. What kind of stupid update is that???? Who the hell has such data to waste??? The developer did a rubbish job. An update is supposed to make an app better not worse. Y'all would have left the app like that."
"Simply garbage, after to update appears ""connecting..."" also for link a PC to my account the same problem, after arrive a message of a new connection 10 minutes later of initial login. My wifi is working perfectly the signal is at 100% is not possible this type of problems, even other apps work correctly. Restarted the phone, shutdown a cycle by complete, and deleting telegram cache and continue the same."
"I am unable to sign up from a new device. No matter how many times I try to get a text you will not send one because I have a Google voice number which I have been using for several years. The same number where I receive texts for business and verifications for all my other apps but not Telegram, so I literally lost 2 years worth of communications and friends contacts because this Telegram app cannot be verified thru Google Text app number, my secure number."
"Absolutely horrible, came back after my previous phone stopped working. When I tried logging in, it says ""We've sent the code to the Telegram app on your other device."" whereas I don't have my other device. Extremely ridiculous and frustrating."
"The app is crashing a lot, I'm not even able to use it for like 5 mins properly everytime is crashes. The message come that the telegram app is not responding. Pleasee kindly resolve this issue. i even dowloaded the update but it isn't resolved although its occuring after the update earlier it was working properly."
"Recently i can't even send any kind of media. No images, no videos, absolutely nothing. I already tryied to re-install the app, stop his activity, clear the cache and nothing works. Like, its just an image and it pass hours and hours and it continues working to send the image."
I'm having a horrible experience with the app. No Matter what I do even by just typing or anything the screen flashes back and forth to a black screen repeatedly at a fast rate constantly and never ever stops. It's irritating on my eyes!
Still not improved After the latest update many problems are coming . Media player is fantastic to go forward â© click on backward button ðð what the f&k After playing one audio next audio is not playing previous one is starting. What the hell is this. Waiting from last 3 update still not solved.
"WORST UPDATE EVER. Now I can't see how much memory a video consumes while exploring media and even finding the length of the video i have to press back button, then it shows the length of all videos, which is annoying, Those were very basic features that are must for an app. Why would you remove them, WHYYY???"
"Though it's suppose to be a secure app I constantly get messages from scammers and blackmailers that I have never given my info to,I have sent in emails and reports inside and outside of the app and nothing has been done to remove these accounts and from what I understand this has been happening to several people and it poses a threat which the app supposedly doesn't stand for,also constantly drops regular calls and video calls. The security issue and function issues need to be taken care of."
"This app used to be my favorite messaging app, but it seems a recent update has a bug in it. It keeps prompting with a banner that keeps popping up about every hour asking me if I want to use real-time translation and nagging me to buy a premium subscription. The ""hide"" option doesn't work and support hasn't responded. It's gotten so annoying I about to stop using it and go back to using Whatsapp."
"1. The app keeps saying ""connecting"" and not working properly. 2. Calls are terrible compared to Signal. They drop or won't connect at all. Sound quality is even bad."
"App fails to be an effective means of communication. Messages will fail to send until hours later, or sometimes not at all. Not a connection issue, other apps will send messages at the same time just fine. I would stop using this app if it were not the only way for me to keep in contact with a few people."
"I somehow don't like the new update on messages reaction, on personal chats. It shows the picture of the person I am chatting and kind of redundant because their picture is showing beside their name. Also, the reaction is somehow larger compare to the last version and it took larger space."
"It has a multitude of issues. The maximum call volume remains low, and there is no option to suppress any call feedback & echoing which has been a long-time issue. The customized chat theme resets to default after exiting the app every time. Deleting saved gifs can only be done one by and not in multiples and no way to change sticker sets' names."
"The app is not working in a proper manner .The issue i m facing is that i m unable to download the file and as soon as the file approaches the 1 GB ,it starts mentioning that the file does not exits . I m having so many hopes with telegram and i m a user of this app for more than 5+years .please figure out this issue . Resolve this issue as soon as possible"
"The ""Saved Message"" function is really unreliable. It's supposed to allow us to store messages and media. But this is the second time the entire chat disappeared, along with all the contents and files inside. I took it as backup but now it's all gone. Again. Not trusting this anymore."
"This app actually deserves 5 stars from me because I love its amazing features. But, recently my number just got banned all of a sudden and I'm unable to log in to my account. I believe it was hacked and used for spamming, which is a security flaw. That's not all, I've sent several emails to telegram support explaining the issue, but none of them was replied. I've been waiting patiently for 4 days now. It's not just about features, please improve your security and customer service as well."
"Telegram is losing it's glory. Lots of bugs everywhere. #1 When a profile video is set, due to some reason the video doesn't play. Tried uninstalling / re-installling, force stopping the app and even restarting the phone itself, but nothing seems to work. #2 Moreover, tried updating the application but it caused another issue to appear that reset the custom theme on the app that I had set up. This is really frustrating and really takes away the whole app experience that we earlier used to have."
I've been using telegram for years. But for the past 2 years all I've been getting is spam msgs from people who aren't in my contacts. This has been increasing to nearly every 2nd day. My privacy has been updated to my contacts only but it doesn't seem to work. At least what's app and messenger filters these spam out.
Unable to receive notification in real time. When I open the app then telegram update and the notification is coming. No notification is coming in background. Checked all settings kept it in urgent notification sound is on vibration is on long but not received the notification.. i have to open the app then I am getting the notification...ð­
"If we clear or swipe away the notification then it still comes back as if the app didn't like. Then I have to do it one more time. What feature is this other than Annoying and irritating. Review2- even after setting the repeat notifications to off, the notifications keep reappearing after swiped away. Review3- No improvement in the above behavior. The app is adamant on us to read the msg even if I swipe it away. Wow what a feature. Thanks telegram for being responsible.."
"My acount CONSTANTLY GETTING HACKEDD!!!!!! This happens over and over again for at least 5 or 6 times since the first day! Someone can somehow bypass the two-step authorization, login to my account, change my profile names and photos, sending messages and adding lots of groups. I have been trying to contact the teams for help but never ever get any response not even an auto-reply. For anyone who wants to use this app, be cautious sending off your personal informations!!!!!"
"Worst app if you want to login. They won't even let you login by using phone number. An email is required too. Once you tap on the ""reset via sms"" they will asked you to tell your friend to give you premium subscription in order to use that option."
"Cannot identify when the phone/tablet is in landscape or vertical mode, and video calls are simply messed up. Unless you forceshut the app, there is no solution. Clearly there is no one testing this issues, and anyway I'm writing in vain. Keep up the good work (for the AI machine that reads this )"
"This application is the best messenger right now, but: The app started to collect already taken usernames and is selling and monetising them. They claim it's because people were taking usernames to sell them (what they are doing really right now), but there are many channels that are for actual public figures or channels with many posts that represent a brand that have lost their addresses and now have to pay for them; not just pay for them, bid for them and hope they can secure the offer!"
"So many bad things 1. You can't hear the voice after when you phone screen sharing. 2. You can't recieved notifications or call sometimes. 3. When you answer the call, It just goes reconnecting.. and nothing happens. It always appears encryption thingy. I cannot only uninstall this since I have so many files and important chats with these stupid app. Don't bother installing this"
"This is a good and reliable app but I recently encounter a problem which happened after I swapped my phone to another and can't seem to get a login code into my account. I've been trying countless time but to no avail,I send messages via Gmail but nothing so far ð©. I don't know what is happening, please help!"
"Honestly it's pretty dumb. There is zero content if you're not following anyone. It's basically Gmail with subscribed email blasts is what it feels like. If you log in you're taken to a bank page, a vast page of nothingness. There's no feed of possible content creators you might care to follow. It's the most basic BS app I've ever downloaded & honestly it's not worth getting notifications from. Followed for Tucker Carlson but I don't see the appeal of the platform whatsoever. Byeeeee"
"Telegrams latest version (9.5.1) is absolutely useless for me. The app is no longer work for me. It keeps crush every time I switch between chats, when record voice message and when i try to open live stream in group. According your information about this Update, the app should work smoothly on older Android versions but what happened is opposite. I wonder how the app work for Android 4.4 devices while i struggle to use on Android 5.2."
"New update same freaking issue. Everything was working great yesterday afternoon but this morning any time I try to send a video message or make a video call...the app kicks me out. It's irritating. In all the years I've used Telegram, I've never had a problem. Please fix this."
"The purchase of premium is worst in case you're looking for increasing in download speed.. Nothing changed my download speed after the premium purchase... Other premium features are fine. Even sometimes the download stuck at 99% as well as the ""Save to Downloads"" options takes too much time. I really annoyed using the premium purchase.."
"If I could a review lesser than one star, I would. The updates are messing up. You download images or videos and it takes forever to load, and then restarts all over again after completely downloading. Or it keeps saying ""wait for video to finish downloading"" when it's completely downloaded. Then you minimise and it starts all over again taking forever to download and even longer to load"
"It's been working well until I updated the app some weeks ago, ever since I've not been able to open the app again. I've uninstalled it couple of times and registered successfully but it still shuts down and shows the same message after registering ""unfortunately telegram has stopped "". It's really annoying. This issue needs to be fixed"
"This version 9.4.9 is not good because (1) heptic feedback from in-app settings is irritating. Whenever I disable any switch from in-app settings, heptic feedback attacks with vibration which irritates me a lot. (2) 'Automatic Media Download' is very frustrating setting because,if I want to disable only video, it is not possible. What I need is separate folders for videos,photos, files to disable each separately. So I can disable only video but other files (photos,files) can be downloaded."
"Hands down the BEST APP of All times!!! Continue doing good things. Editing just now..(2/4/2023) the latest update has made the app VERY difficult to use.. while setting a search, the list of Downloaded media along with the Catche media for future download doesn't show anymore. I had to search a lot just to find my OWN downloaded files. The old list is just GONE. Please make is back as it was or things will get VERY difficult for all the users. Updates were supposed to be good, not BAD !"
"This app sucks at loading media. I literally have to download the image before I view it, ntm the VERY slow loading in each image downloads. And yeah, video media is even slower both in playback and download! Might as well just use the desktop app instead."
Always facing the same issues whenever am sending a gif from gifs in secret chat the app gets crashed and black out even after updating and restarting app or mobile I can't see anything in the app it gets closed automatically. In the last I need to delete the app and install it again...
"Every update so far has been killing this app and i never complained, but this last one has pushed me to my limit. Previously one could find all their downloaded files under the file manager but now only pictures and videos can be found. Under settings for storage data and storage i could freely delete media especially files i couldn't find anywhere else on my phone, but since this new update i could only course cacheÂ¡!! Who the hell cares about that? I award you best in ruining good things ð¡ð¤¬"
"This application worked perfectly well before the update. After the updates, translating texts became an issue. When translating from, chinese or Russian for example to English, it just greys out and the App closes off!!! This is very annoying. Please kindly have it fixed"
"They banned my phone number within 24 hours of signing up. I have not sent or seen a single message, nor added anyone. My phone number predates Telegram and I've had full control of it the entire time, so it's not like it was previously used."
"Worse application full of scammers Alot of scammers on it ,Edit Messages. Quickly fix mistakes and information to a message they are sent to victims. and they deleted all messages, once they are delete messages they run away. The reports doesn't do anything for that ppl. Alot of fakes group on telegram , even i made alot of reports, nothing happened"
"It's okay, BUT I'd like it more if I could block someone in the group chat vs only through private messaging and phone calls. That seems to be the most needed feature, if you're not a moderator."
"This app is crashing continuously on group video calls, crashes again and again and now it is so frequent that the time of crash of less than one min. You won't be able to be in video call for more that a minute in any group call. Nonsense. What kind of bug is this."
Worst experience ever I am not able to connect this app after one time. No contacts are showing. No msgs. I get notifications but can't open a single msg. I update it many times but nothing happen that make me easy to use this app
The features and function of the app and service are actually really good. Unfortunately it's ruined by crashing literally ever 5 minutes on all my Samsung devices. Clean reinstall solves if for a few days only then it goes back to crashing Update: dropping to 1 as this app is becoming unusable due to its frequent crashing.
"Is there anyway to disable the option to auto delete our account? Or at least provide a longer duration like 2 years instead of a year. I want to take a break from social media for a year, but i don't want my telegram account to be deleted. The mobile that i will be using for the next year won't be able to run telegram. Edit: I am not receiving new SMS messages or calls from telegram. First, i just had to enter my email and password for logging in but now they are asking for number."
Before update...it was the best app.but after updating..it became worst app... I have to download files every time..again and again... Doesn't show downloaded files in download option Please fix it as soon as possible...otherwise we have to go for other options
"I already subscribe for VIP, but I'm really disappointed, please fix bug or the problems that member can still save content from my private channel. They open the android folder from file manager and then easily copy-paste it to another folder. I would love to change my rating to 5 star again if you guys can fix this problem."
"A few months ago Telegram gave me the option to save all the content I download to the SD card, but the updates have ruined the app, I download the content but it just keeps getting saved in the internal storage and then I have to move it to the SD card. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times, I thought it was a problem on my phone, I reselected the SD card as the default storage but it still doesn't work."
"None of my video messages are sending and it just doesn't seem worth the space on my device to keep this buggy app. I've promoted Telegram as a better WhatsApp substitute but it looks like I was wrong. It justed into just another shiny but cheap knock-off. Fix the bugs and your customers will stop switching to other apps. As much as I dislike WhatsApp, at least I don't have these technical issues with their app. So frustrating!"
"When I tried to sign up i got a pop up that, we are calling you at mentioned number please do not accept the call, Telegram will process everything automatically. But the singup was never done automatically. I tried to uninstall and install the apps multiple times but still same issue. Worst experience to sign up."
"WHEN ARE YOU FIXING THE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SECRET CHATS??? They get cancelled by Telegram every few days. Also they do not work properly. After setting up a secret chat I don't receive messages, files...It works for a few hours and that's it. Then I have to open a new secret chat because the actual one doesn't work anymore. It's so frustrating because this problem exits for weeks now and it has started with one of the updates in February or March this year. SO PLEASE HELP!"
"Customer support is either a joke, or non-existent. Made two consecutive resets of device yesterday, and now I can't receive activation code. No reply from Telegram support. App itslef is fairly good, and I haven't had any problems untill now. And boy, is it taking forever. For me, that's it. I used it mostly to participate in several channels, but messaging was mostly always over other platforms."
"From last update it's very poor performance. I am having many issues in groups like contents are not showing in media and files section but visible when searched for it and in chat area, Also some of the files are hidden but visible when searched in files section, whenever I search for a file in files section in group and click visual icon it is only showing last file in the group, and i am unable to add new members to my group."
Scrolling pictures and videos(in full screen mode) by side screen tap is very annoying (espacially assuming that double side screen tap performs video rewind and single screen tap hides details from the screen). Moreover content switch/scroll is done by side swipe and it is much intuitive. Can you please add an option or setting to turn it off or to switch between swipe and side screen tap? It is very important for me. Thank you. ADD OPTION TO TURN OFF SCREEN LOCKING ON AUDIO MESSAGE PLAY!!
"I don't have any clue why you guys aren't taking my reported issues at priority. Bug: App completely stops functioning if gifs get failed to sent, i faced this in January, tried reaching out to dev team and even put up tweets not no action and has to lose all my private chat data. Once again I'm facing same issue, when sending gifs from telegram emoji/gif/sticker section, app doesn't open it gif was failed to deliver.FYI, I'm using latest telegram version on Android 12. PLEASE DO SOMETHING!!!"
"It says updating up on the top since yesterday. I can not see any new messages since. I know I got a lot of new messages because I got notifications. But when I open the app, there is new messages. I restarted the app several times, then restarted the phone with no change."
Just got hit by this by accidentally tapping on âDonât show pinned messagesâ. It seems like a mis feature a bit. Why would anyone want to hide pinned messages forever in a channel or group? And why thereâs no way to get them back without reinstalling the app and rejoining the group. Seems like someone definitely forgot to put an undo button somewhere :) No solution to date (2023)?
"I'd love to use a messaging app with privacy but they all suck unless your friends all use the same app. The app appearance looks nothing like it's shown, you have to read a million message board posts to learn how to use it and it cannot, for whatever reason, be set as the default. Security is pointless if you can't use the app."
"Still connecting even if I have a stable internet connection. This used to be a good app. But last month It has the problem which makes the app unusable. The app says ""connecting"", even I have stable connection. No vpn or proxy is used. Any other apps can access their services trough internet. And then out of nowhere the problem disappears and after some time it appears again. Please fix this."
"Telegram is very useful app, I almost spending one hours daily in telegram. But recently I had bad experience in telegram, there is more time taken to load messages especially images and videos that will force me to avoid time spending in telegram. First I think it is bcz of the network issue then I realised that there no issues with other app. I eagerly waiting for an upadate to sort out my problems."
"I just updated my Telegram, don't know why it keeps loading even though I have a stable and fast Internet connection. It takes so much time to load chats and content both on my desktop and the phone. I have even purchased the subscription, no difference. Please fix the bug here quickly as I need to promptly answer business related conversations."
"I use this app for several years already, and no any update has fixed media freezing yet. Looks like the developers do not use or test this thing at all. Every minute, I have to close and restart it to start downloading and showing media."
"First of all fix the bugs and I cannot seem to delete my second account that is unnecessary. App seems to close whenever I open it. It is a bit frustrating. I will rethink this review when I am able to delete my second account and the bugs are gone! This should originally be atleast 4 stars since the app is nice, I am disappointed; I expected better from this app!!"
"It was my favourite app, but they slowed down the upload so much that it became unuseable. If I'm gonna need to use some other app in order to send a photo or 30s video under 10 minutes, I'm just gonna chat there as well. You should offer some premium service for premium member, not remove the basic ones to force people into paying."
"For the most part I like this app. But the fact that certain settings require you to download an app on PC to change them is stupid. It's not that hard to add the damn setting in app. If this is changed my review will be changed to reflect that, but until then this is the highest rating I will give"
"While downloading a video using both mobiledata and wifi after download,Iam unable to play that video neither save it to downloads even after fast switching from wifi to data or vice-versa during the download,instead it starts to download from the very beginning again.It has happened not 1 or 2 times but many times.Fix this bloody-bugðð. Many people want to download using 2 networks(wifi and data) when they have low mobile data how can we download using one network option all the timeðð¤¨ð."
Absolute worst messaging communication app ever! All messages come in very late sometimes up to one day late and very very important notifications that are on a time limit for my response are never sent on time and this app is by far the worst messaging app I've ever used. I highly recommend that nobody even download this or use this app it is a complete waste of time
"What is happening with the app I have my channel with some songs and every single time that I re-open it I need to be downloading the same song hundreds of times and is bothering, that didn't happen before. I actually like to use the app but I don't know why this is happening."
"App sucks, trying to login to the app since two days it tell you that they are calling for verification do not accept the call and we do nothing still it does not verify post which they have the option to verify through text which does not even work you cannot click at the option then why do we have that. The tech team needs to pull up there socks and work on resolving the issues"
It asks permission to read call logs but never auto verifies the call. You would still need to manually enter the OTP that you get on SMS or mail which it forces you to provide. And EVEN that doesn't work most the time. Not to mention the lack of action taken on reporting. All kinds of spammy and sexually violent profile still exist despite multiple reports
"The app was very good till it started recently to crash , and even worse today it deleted some very important videos I downloaded , i still cant believe that all the time I spent waiting for them to download you destroyed in less than a second , y'all better fix this app , because it's just too ridiculous to ruin it this way , and I'm still in shock that you suddenly crashed and kicked me out and deleted all those videos , shame on you"
Read receipts when 'topics' is enabled still doesn't work. Video chat is virtually unusable. No volume control on Android version. I can't hear anyone talk using headphones. 200% slider control on iPhone. If I mute a member s/he disappears and has to rejoin. Telegrams really made a mess of this update.
"This is the worst social media app. Firstly, you have to download the app on phone or tablet first, then sign up. Then, you can use it on a different device, after logging back in to your phone or tablet to enter a code every single time. Plus, the GUI can be better."
"I use telegram to message my mom. She doesn't have a smartphone, so she uses the desktop app. After this most recent update, she needs to sign back in and when it gets to the send the code it's not being delivered to her flip-phone. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, NOT EVERYONE ONE HAS A SMART PHONE. Repeated emails to your support site for solution, or to have it fixed. She has heard nothing. Just like every other company out there, you get popular and too big and the product becomes junk."
Deletes the file as soon as it finishes downloading. Doesn't even give us a chance to preview. To top it all off it waits till download is 100% and deleted it the second it touches 100%. Losing faith in this app because I don't have gbs and gbs of bandwidth just laying around.
"There is a problem in the proximity sensor only in the telegram app athe audio is not playing in the ear piece speaker if i keep it ro my ears, it was working fine in my old device (OnePlus 6t) now it's not working properly in my samsung galaxy s23 ultra but it works well in other apps like whatsapp, so please fix it ASAP. Thankyou."
"Why would anyone subscribe to premium when the basic app doesn't work! Phone calls and video calls are terrible; Never able to connect! When you do manage to connect, it ends up disconnecting. Needs support for HEIC. Also GIFs no longer work. Needs support for Google authenticator as 2FA"
"The app was amazing at first, but after the last update, I've been having problems with downloading audio messages or playing voice notes it just keeps rolling no matter how good the network is. please try to go fix this issue ."
"Ever since telegram premium was introduced, the regular telegram set out on a path of slow yet steady malfunction. Lately I'm tryna download a 275mb app, I quickly switch tabs to PlayStore, on getting back, the whole download has been reset...i have a good data connection, buh it took me long hours to reach 173mb of my download, and now it's all.... puff!!!ððð"
Worst video call quality and download speed. I get it you want to keep best for premium users. But you must not compromise on basic features in free version. Video calls are always pixelated wit blotchy voice and download speed hardly crosses 200 kb. This is super rediculous and terrible.
"Can't login without email. Why do I have to link my email? It should be my choice to link or not. Please bring back the verification via sms. If anyone wants to link their telegram with their emails, let them but don't force such data out of unwilling users. Telegram was preferred because of its claims to give users more control over their data. If that's not happening, I would rather leave telegram then link email. There's no dearth of messaging apps afterall."
"This app really is just throwing itself in the garbage. It pushes reels so hard, but can't get them to work right, so I'll be scrolling them for a while, and when I close the app and click a different one later, the next swipes are same ones I had already seen, in the same exact order. It also tells me when to swipe a reel if I watch the same one a couple of times, as if it's giving me a tutorial on how to use it. Also posting images glitches edits and crops them weird no matter what you do."
"The words ""Something went wrong. Please try again"" haunt me in my sleep. Reels editor is a disaster. I have a fairly new and powerful phone so it's not my device's issue, plus I've seen other reviewers with the same problem. It freezes up as soon as you start doing ANYTHING in it (adding clips, trimming them, music, text, transitions, etc.). With how much money Meta has and how much they push reels in the algorithm, there's no excuse for it to be such a trainwreck!"
"It's a little annoying that you can't turn off the stupid auto scroll feature. You can't get halfway through a post before the app decides you're done and moves on. Lately, videos won't fully load. It doesn't matter how strong cell/wi-fi service is. Videos will play for a few seconds, then just stop. Then the app will just start scrolling through ads for you."
"[Update: had to uninstall to have my posts load. Except now it makes it so all my video covers are zoomed in, even on my profile page. Now my profile looks off because the video cuts from zoomed in to normal.] If you send multiple photos to someone, then it appears in a stack that can't even be opened. You have to refresh constantly to see new messages. On the explore page, it has an auto scroll that can't be turned off so you have to fight the auto scroll to even consume content."
"If you share multiple photos with someone, you can't even look through them or save them. It shows them as a stack of photos, but inaccessible. Messaging barely provides notification nor does it refresh itself. I have to go back to my feed and refresh my feed before my messages will refresh. Sometimes a full closing and re-opening of the app is the only way to fix it."
"One second I can do something and the next I can't, this app has been bugging for ages and it's ridiculous. The option to post to my story quite literally just disappeared within a second, no matter how many times I restart the app it's still gone. Not only this, but my notifications also just spontaneously stopped working, I cannot for the life of me fix it."
"I can barely post anymore! Therr are so many glitches. It takes forever to load any features when I try to edit a reel. It takes several minutes to edit each piece, so by three time I'm done, I've spent an hour putting together 1 reel! Most of that time is spent waiting for app to load the features. Then If I save a draft, several video clips are then blank/black, so I can't even edit. Please fix this for Android."
"A photo app incapable of handling photos... Crops even images I import that are already in square format. Edits rarely make it to post, weird white borders appear randomly, can't properly post multiple images with any consistency. These are all easy features. Not sure what is going on on the back end, but you'd think having basic functionality would be a priority. Been going on for months. Get it together guys."
"Needs to be fixed. Since the most recent update I can't view reels and don't even have the reels option. I've logged out and logged back in (multiple times), I've uninstalled and reinstalled (multiple times), I've reported the problem in the app (multiple times), I've cleared my cache, and I've turned my data saver off. Nothing works. Fix your app."
"I love instagram and I've used it for years. But why in the world can I no longer reshare posts on my story? That's a fundamental part of the experience on Instagram--authentic connection and exposure based on who you follow and not a botched algorithm. Also, having to click the log in button again and again when signing in and out of my business and personal profiles is irritating and wastes time. Please fix these bugs."
"Not even worth the time it takes to post things anymore with how buggy the app has gotten. It doesn't make sense that it's owned by one of the wealithiest corporations in the world yet it functioned better in 2015. Forget about editing anything in the app, the editing software is glitchy, will freeze and randomly crop photos if you even think about resizing them, not to mention anything to do with reels or stories is completely unusable."
"Constantly deleting clips in reels, drafts disappearing, whole reels saying they can't be posted and you have to start from scratch - absolutely horrible. At my wits end and decided to leave a negative review today after consistently having issues with the app. Today I created a reel where I dressed up and did my makeup for the transition with an event I'm attending. It decided not to save these clips after moving them and there is absolutely nowhere to reclaim these lost videos. 1 star."
"App has two bugs but not sure if one is a bug or just a new restriction. First bug is posting multiple photos is impossible as it keeps messing up one or more photos position no matter what you do. The second is the disappearance of the ""Add post to story"" option. You can now only seem to share public posts to friends only and not to your stories?!"
"was texting a friend today when they sent photos, and i was told i HAD to update the app in order to look at them. when i updated the app everything looked normal, however as i started using it more once home, i noticed that i can no longer share posts from my explore page, or anywhere for that matter, to my story. and when i went to my direct messages, they took out the ability to see who is active at a quick glance, and we can no longer put short messages to our profiles. please, stop updating"
"I moved from US 2 Spain. The first few days were fine. Then I got a notice that the location where my data was being stored had changed. I clicked agree & now I can't use the app. The page glitches when I open it - toggling between a blank white page & a pop up that says ""you're all set thanks"". If I hit the back arrow, it says continue reviewing or leave, but there's nothing to review - just blank white page. I uninstalled & reinstalled 3xs. Now, the app says it doesn't recognize me on my cell."
"Edit: I can post again, though the app still has many problems still Instagram won't let me post anything. I've tried closing the app and restarting my phone, but I'm still unable to post. Messaging friends is a problem as well. Way too often my messages will take too long to send. And even if they do send, the person I am messaging doesn't always recieve them."
"Everytime I cannot load up my videos at times and have to do it more than. It works for awhile then I have to uninstall and reinstall the app... Same time, I was looking for a fx effects. Also I noticed some of my videos, music cut off, got stuck and wasn't working like originally and I had to start over. When I posted a video I saw my videos on some of post weren't there. Please fix it!!"
This is the worst app if you actually try to edit and post reels. It is insanely glitchy. Constantly tells you something went wrong and makes you force stop the app and try again. It will take you a good 45 minutes to post a 30 second clip as you are constantly trying to get an edit without any glitches on it. For an app that's been around so long I expect so much better.
"Don't know what happened but my account suddenly can't share ANYTHING to stories (I'm aware of privacy settings for accounts and posts), Options appear and disappear (create group button for example)...I can only â¤ï¸ posts and not react with other emoji. It's more of my account being messed up...otherwise I guess the App itself okay. Could be a combination of the two. I enjoy Instagram but lately it's been more frustrating than anything. Tried everything app related (data, cache etc) and nothing."
The app saves pictures to my camera roll even with the setting turned off! I do not want to save these to my camera roll! Fix this bug immediately! The pop up about Reels after posting to the Story Highlights section is totally annoying! Uploading videos in high quality is absolutely impossible! Why even offer the setting in the first place of it doesn't work! META is absolute junk!
The carousel will not save edits. I can edit one photo save it then go to the next photo when I'm done the last photo I edited has reverted to it's original form. Still hasn't been fixed. It's been closing in on 5 months and multiple updates. Instagram either doesn't care and is a dying app. Don't waist your time with this app. If they aren't going to bother to fix it might as well go over to TikTok.
"For months I've been unable to edit multi-photo posts. It does not save the position of the photos. When I edit the photo and click save, the photo shifts over, causing it to be oddly cropped and creating a large white space on one side. What's the deal? Why are you unable to fix this? I've submitted this issue multiple times. I know I'm one of many people experiencing this issue. Very frustrating. This issue limits what I can post."
"Awful app that just keeps getting worse. Half the time I go to record a video for my story, I get an error message after I stop recording, and all the footage is lost. I don't know how one of the biggest companies manages to drop the ball sooo hard over and over. Stop trying to be other apps. Instagram used to be awesome. Stop taking away good things and adding terrible ideas. On reels you used to be able to ""don't show me reels with this sound"" and you took that option away why? Just dumb."
"Twice in the last month, Instagram has disabled my account with threat of permanent disablement within 30 days with no explanation. To re-enable the account, you have to go through a mysterious black box process, and if it fails, you lose access to all of your photos forever with no recourse. If you use this app, back up your images to another service or you could lose everything for no discernible reason with no warning."
"It's honestly a rather junky inconvenient app. Why would I want to see other videos when I'm trying to scroll through the videos that were sent to me. It's cluttered, you can't pause videos, you can't fast forward or rewind, there's barely any organization to videos you like, searches give you the most random results, posting and editing is inefficient, they sell your information, there isn't much protection from unsafe material. It's just in general a horrible app"

I've submitted this issue multiple times. I know I'm one of many people experiencing this issue. Very frustratin. This issue limits what I can post."
"for some reason with the new update if you click the ""touch up"" feature during video calls it creates a weird glitch where you can see two of yourself and makes it super blurry. I can't find anyone else saying this but it's very frustrating. Sometimes my app won't even open and it takes 30 minutes to an hour to be able to send media such as photos and videos. and there are sooo many ads."
"Editing photos and videos has become the biggest, most frustrating hassle. I'll spend 15-20 minutes tweaking a photo, cropping and positioning it, only for it to revert back to its original appearance once I try to save my changes. Either that or it corrupts the file or turns the photo sideways. Or it shifts the photo to one side, leaving a black or white blank space on the other side. Never mind the amount of ads and the push for reels. Insta's ð® any more."
"Just discovered I'm not the only one with this issue.... mid selections, or photo editing, the app just resizes the photos, or corrupts a photo, or voids the edits. Sometimes it takes 20 minutes to edit... and all of it just goes away. Videos don't appear. Stories after posting, won't exit and I have to ""discard"". The app has gotten worse through the last year."
The app is so buggy. Features are taken and given away at random with no notice at all. Even different accounts on the same device can be layout differently. It's frustrating. Often messages won't send or I won't get a notification when a message is sent to me even though I didn't turn off notifications. My feed refuses to load. I can't even type without having to restart the app because it keeps hiding the text box so I can't see what I'm typing. This app just gets worse with each update.
"The app has become frustrating to use. The layout changes have caused a lot of time waste and annoyance. Now I have a bug where I can't send a post to someone I talk to regularly because it will continuously send the message to a group with that user and a mutually blocked user. Whenever one bug is fixed another, worse bug comes out. Getting really old at this point. Why did they try to fix something that wasn't broken."
"My app won't open ð­ I have done all of the trouble shooting. I've uninstalled it, restarted my phone, reinstalled it, deleted stuff off my phone storage. Nothing is working. The icon screen is as far as it goes. ð­ I'm trying to get a business going and this happens. So frustrating! Instagram is usually great but this is not good. I haven't been able to post a reel for 4 days now! Arg!"
"Instagram does not care about the user, only marketing. It no longer feels personalized or that its adapting to my use. I want to share a video to my account, I do not want it to be a reel. The reel editing is terrible. Stories work half the time. The app freezes constantly, I have a brand new phone. It's just frustrating to be rerouted to reels when I want to post to my story or my feed. I can't trim a video for a story post either. Focus on photo and video sharing. Not shopping."
"I spend 45 minutes to an hour creating a real, tweaking it to be perfect... Only to see that after uploading it (in the ""highest quality"" too), Instagram lags my perfect timing. All the text and pictures were synced up perfectly with each other and the song I chose prior to uploading. But after it's posted, the timing and overlap of the text, music, and pictures is all jumbled. Why would I use Instagram Reels to waste time & become frustrated when I can hop on over to the ""clock"" app instead?"
"insta is constantly rolling out updates that make your life more inconvenient on the app. they constantly remove and change features while ignoring bugs and glitches. the app has gotten slower and more frustrating over the years to the point that I consistently think of ditching the app altogether. I use it as a useful tool for news and connecting with a small group of friends rather than entertainment. tiktok does that a million times better. if you can avoid insta entirely, I highly advise it"
"This app does not work. Every feature on the app fails regularly. It makes posting photos & videos incredibly difficult. It won't take certain images. I'll share a post to a story only to find hours later that it never worked. I've spent hours cutting video for a slideshow to meet the ridiculous file sharing requirements only to click ""post"" and have the whole thing disappear. It does this on my phone & laptop. If I didn't need it for work I would quit. Please let's all find a different app."
"This app sucks for viewing pictures and videos. It doesn't allow users to double-tap to make pictures bigger or zoom into photos and scroll around. I know about using two fingers to zoom. But it zooms out as soon as you lift your fingers off of the screen. This is cumbersome and not user friendly. Secondly, watching videos on this app is terrible because they are too small and don't play in landscape mode which would make them bigger."
"Haven't been able to use reels in over a month. They suddenly stopped appearing in my feel, in discovery, there is no more reels button and if I click on one in messages it doesn't allow scrolling. Support messages have gone unanswered, updated the app multiple times since then, reinstalled and logged out. Nothing works, half your app is unavailable."
"You can't change the highlights pictures from your gallery, at all. It gives you the option but then it's just stuck in a constant uploading cycle. Which at one point I waited an hour and it didn't change it. On top of that, they deny shadow banning but they do it to my account all the time. I used to get a lot of reach. 200+ likes on one picture. Now I get an average of 10, even with the same hashtags."
"Really upset with the Instagram algorithm. Instead of showing you content as it is posted (which it used to waaay back) or even things you're naturally interested in, it pushed paid posts and things they want you to see and interact with. Barely usable. Also! Photo editing has been glitchy recently, I'll adjust a photo and save it only for it to revert to original position, etc. So frustrating!!"
App moving in the wrong direction with lots of engagement tweaks they've made which are just like why? Why does the app now scroll the pictures in someone's post automatically? Like it was too hard for me to swipe when I was actually finished looking at the picture. Way to go on the stories now not pausing while you type a response so you end up hitting send and it's 2 stories further in and you send the message accidentally to the other unintended recipient. like that's real smart. ðð½
"Terrible user interface. Tried to log in on a new phone, and not only did it fail to recognize anything but the exact acct name (despite an option for email or cell number), but it also now requires a secondary password for my secondary acct, so I can't access that either. And with everything moved out of the app, I can't delete either accounts without first creating a fb account. It's a hot mess."
"This app is extremely glitchy. I have so many problems posting stories and texting people. Sometimes stories will get fully stuck on my screen snd I have to reload the entire app. I also always have to reload my messages because new ones won't show. Since I updated the app, most of the time when I open it posts will show up but then the first one or even all of them will disappear."
"My bf and i share reels with each other through facebook messenger. We copy the link in instagram and paste it into messenger. For the last month or so, we have not been able to open the links without it being ridiculously cumbersome. I click the link and it opens the wrong video, and he has the same issue. The thumbnail shows we sent the right videos but they will not open! We've updated the app and cleared the cache and its still broken. This is so frustrating!"
"New update has bugs, sharing posts to stories, nothing happens when I tap, when before it would change the layout. Now says to double tap to add avatar, which I have no idea what that means, but nothing happens when I try. Not happy at all. Also hate the fact it keeps trying to get me to make reels out of past stories. Stop moving buttons around."
"I have a business account and it is progressively getting worse. Don't even try to post reels, the sound or the text (or both) won't upload correctly. If you change the orientation of a photo, it crops incorrectly. I can't schedule posts or add collaborators. My messages disappear constantly. I was wrongfully charged with a ""violence"" content violation when sharing another user's reel (that is still posted) to my story, which caused my reach to drop 95%. Yall have some major problems to fix."
"Reels are missing from discover and there is no reels 'tab' in the navigation. I can only see them if someone sends me one and I can't scroll from those to new ones. I updated my phone, updated the app, reinstalled the app, and it's still the same. I also can't turn off auto scroll. I can't even finish the first panel of a comic without getting flicked to something else. How lame."
"App functionality becomes less user-friendly with each update. Ads are the center focus, rather than social networking. Smple functions of the app refuse to load or operate correctly, but ads will always play and never fail to appear at regular intervals. There are plenty of better places to share your photos with friends that are far less frustrating."
"It seems like instagram, the photo sharing app, can't be bothered to actually function as a photo sharing app. It's a toss-up if my photo edits survive each stage of the posting process, and I am getting white bars next to my pictures, where the photo auto mis aligns between stages. This seems like it would be priority 1 for a photo sharing app. Hey guys, you're not tiktok. Stop trying to be and just do what you're (supposedly) good at. Also, clean up the gross porn bots."
"I can not save more then 2 videos on my collection. If I save more than that then it just keeps removing and adding the same video in different collections. I have to keep existing instagram to save a single video to the right collection. I've tried everything to fix it. Uninstall and reinstall, delete the cache, delete the data, and updated the app. Nothing works!"
"Disappointing and underwhelming. An app that's been around for years and still struggles to find its own formula to update and improve on, and inconsistent user interface. Over time they also begun complicating the users setting when trying to deactivate/delete their account. Causing it to be such an inconvenience to do via web. Trying to hold on the last bit of support they can even though it's a forced use of their platform."
"The newest update has ruined the app. It was good for a while, but whoever decided to put ""reply"" and ""send"" buttons on the same part of the screen as the android navigation buttons was really smart. They ""fixed"" something that was working fine and now it doesn't."
"I swear the app literally tweaks out if I try to unsend a message that has a link in it. Not only that, every time I send a bunch of photos to someone, I can't even see the photos! All it does is just show the stack of photos, and I can't even click them to view them! Why on earth would you do this Meta!? It's like you're asking people to delete your app so you lose your profit! This is unacceptable. Either you fix this or I keep this review as a one star. Fix your damn app!"
"I have never had a constant issue with Instagram until recently. I tried using boomerang and it never posted, I tried posting a video and that still didn't post, and every time I add music it keeps repeating the same lyrics to the next video. Overall, anything you try to upload goes into an error. Quite frustrating when you are a business owner."
"No longer length videos?? Really? Stupid decision I don't support. I enjoy sharing videos that share how I feel. But 90 seconds doesn't get the full message across. Please bring back the ability to post longer videos it really ruins it. Also, if we could change the ratio of all of the photos when posting multiple, that would be lovely. Other than that, there are no issues here."
"This app is so RIDICULOUSLY, INEXCUSABLY broken. Its primary purposes are hardly functional. Editing photos is a nightmare. Making too many changes to one photo will offset the frame positioning of another photo, and you can't fix it without ANOTHER photo being repositioned, and then it's an endless back and forth hell and you have to start your post all over. Reels will crash AT LEAST twice before you're finished editing your video. I almost always have to edit things in a separate app first."
"At most points in time the app is tolerable, though as of lately it hasn't been. It has horrible time adjusting to different phones cameras, this leaving the filter and other functions to make pictures look absolutely horrible when they are posted. Sometimes when people post on the app, it glitches and doesn't allow a person to post because ""there's not enough space"". Also when there is an anonymous mental health check it's really concerning, especially when the user didn't do anything wrong."
"App is frustrating. They made reels the main way to be seen but actually filming/editing them is basically impossible to accomplish with frequent crashes and freezing up. Not to mention losing progress in editing or even just losing filmed content all together. Editing photos has similar effect. It's very difficult to try and run a business when I can't actually post reels and photos are basically ignored by the algorithm. If you're going to make us do reels, then give us functioning tools."
"Wish I could give zero stars. I'm completely locked out of my account. I use the right password, the right email, the correct confirmation codes... it only ever takes me to a completely white, blank screen that says error. I can't contact anyone at Instagram to help. I've submitted multiple bug reports. I've done a selfie video to try to get access back. But it doesn't seem like an access issue, it seems like a weird random bug, so I'm screwed. Enough of a problem to make me quit forever...."
"Instagram is honestly so annoying. There s like a new update every week, I just want things to stay the same but it's always changing like moving the reels from the bottom middle to the side. And the post button from the top right next to the dms to the bottom middle. It's really frustrating ig developers respectfully do better. And I uninstalled ig just for a min and when I re-download it the entire app is different. Like it just went back in time and lost 20 updates. I'm absolutely frustrated."
"Ads are everywhere including on non-influencer friends profiles! I hate scrolling through a friends profile just to see ads. Enough is enough. There are two ads for every few reels and in between every story. It is ridiculous!!! In terms of functionality, Instagram is ok. Trying to post and edit items to go to my stories or my feed are a challenge. I would like to post my full photo not a cropped version"
"What is happening?! I made an additional account and it was immediately banned. Literally instantly. On top of that, my drafts keep getting deleted or my drafts save, but the descriptions, preferences, and alt text get deleted. To make matters even worse, the app butchers content quality after uploading and makes things grainy. Sometimes it just refuses to post altogether, despite me having adequate Wifi."
"Literally always crashing and distorts or messes up every post, reel or story I try to upload. Doesn't work more than times it does. Truly frustrating app. I've tried so many times to use it and get excited when I think it will actually work this time, but always ends in disappointment when it glitches, distorts and ruins what I had been working on."
"Instagram has always been good to me -- until lately. Whenever I try to upload a video, it lags up my whole phone and takes an hour or more to upload a one minute video. I make music, so this has become a REAL hassle for me. Probably going to stop using the software entirely in the near future if this isn't resolved soon. I would hate to, but it's worse for my sanity than anything at this point. I hope you call resolve this issue, asap."
"Every single time I try to post on my WORK ACCOUNT I get a message saying it's compromised. I've changed the password, like it requests, 4 different times now. I chose to clear the cache and data in my settings, and about an hour later while I was typing a post caption it popped up again. Tried to reset my password and got a page with the FB logo and an error message. Not even going to bother trying again. FIX THIS!"
"Instagram steals ideas from competitors, but never the right ones. It's algorithm does nothing to help creators grow. It wants to be tiktok even though it should be a photo sharing app. Half the features barely work. It lacks features that it SHOULD have. If there was an alternative that had a comparable user base, I would delete this poor excuse of an app and never look back."
"I hate what this app and what it has become! So homophobic! Also, pushing reels on everyone just to stay competitive with tiktok is annoying! If I wanted to use tiktok I would! Edit: I have no way of changing the sensitivity setting to allow for more content, even though I have updated the app and and over the age of 18! Also, some functions are unavailable for no reason, like the ""add yours"" function! Just not there! And I have put in numerous requests with no assistance!"
"Keeps logging me out for ""suspicious activity"" and asking for videos of my face to ""verify I'm not a bot,"" but crashes when I try to submit the video - and those are the times it doesn't give me a blank error screen. I'm not using 3rd party apps, I have been forced to change my password 3 times now. This app is garbage. Edit: Bought a new phone (my old phone wasn't THAT old) and was able to fix the login issue myself. But sometimes it doesn't save the posts I try to save. Still a garbage app."
"Updated: it's still doing it Instagram has always had a problem cropping photos when you go to post them, but now it's getting out of hand. It crops every single photo you post by 1/4 of the picture,and if you try to post multiple pictures it distorts or uncenters all of them. And only let's you correct one of the pictures because the second you sent her it and press back and click on another picture it distorts the one you just corrected. And continues"
"This app is designed to get people, especially kids, addicted to scrolling, whatever the cost. I know that's the goal from a business perspective, but it's completely unethical the way Instagram does it. I re-downloaded the app after not having it for a while, and if I scroll down through a few reels, it always starts to feed me videos of women posing in skimpy clothing. No matter what kind of reel I originally clicked on or the other reels I was watching. I want memes, not porn."
"Constantly freezes after opening and this can last for hours. It seems to load the feed as normal, but inaccessible, freezes immediately and asks to close or wait or report. They seem to be comfortable with being a third rate hokey app. Poor design, poor functionality, lots of bugs. Just a very cheap feel. It's like a people-walmart. Previous: Get your clown app sorted out, insta. It doesn't even work now. Mostly I don't care because it is a clown app. But I dont like when things don't work."
"When it comes to making a post, this app is atrocious. From selecting multiple images for a post being buggy, to the app being extremely sluggish when trying to tag multiple people across multiple images for one post. The worst is when you finish tagging everyone after waiting the unbearable wait times to find them, and then going back to see all your progress gone and back at square one. Which again, is a buggy nightmare. Please fix this."
"After this new update, I can't seem to put my story in my highlights. It so buggy, like the pixel don't even add up on the picture and it so blurry. The app be in black and white. It's looks like glitchy TV screen. Give us a good update Edit, Update app and everything is still the same. But now, the image don't pop up and I have to retry and still doesn't work"
"It's ok, not the best app. There's so many bots now and remixing videos is a task. Also I don't like that I can't pause reels/videos. And the algorithm kind of sucks. It's not as fun scrolling through your feed if it's not really catering to your interests. I'm tired of seeing blueface and chrisean rock drama and this is one of the only places I see it."
"I am frustrated that whenever I post art it never reaches out to a fuller audience, I use to get tons of likes and now I barely get anymore. After the update with the algorithm I feel like I lost my confidence in my art more and is ruining my experience with Instagram. The app has such potential but it decides it wants to be terrible experience and that's why I'm giving it 1 star. I hope the Instagram team can fix this issue."
I can't see the reels anymore. I don't have the icon. I have uninstalled and installed the app to see if that would fix the problem. The first few times it did but now it doesn't. I also can't scroll up or down if I do see a reel. So frustrated with this app now. Can you please fix the problem? I feel like instagram doesn't care about these problems because they never get fixed.
"Literally always glitching. Spent over an hour editing a reel since I can't just post pics anymore and when trying to edit the duration of clips it wouldn't expand. Kept reopening til it worked. When I went to upload it it said ""can't upload this video"" with an x next to it rather than ""try again"" or atleast leaving it in my drafts. I updated the app, toggled on and off data and wifi and restarted my phone to no avail. I'm livid. Now I have to do it all over again and rewrite the long caption"
"The app has lately been showing explicit ads, with no way to reduce the number of them. The most recent update also cuts off the feed from people I follow, and shows instead ""suggested posts."" There's an Explore page for a reason, and if I wanted to see posts from people I don't follow, I'd look there. The app says I've seen all new posts from the last 3 days, but that's patently false. I'm also unable to post videos longer than 15 seconds. This update is terrible."
"The experience does not feel the same as it once did. It is a bit hard to explain but i just dont get the same joy as i once did. Also editing a video takes an excessive amount of time with not many options available. Definitely better competition out there. Also not gonna lie, i think it acceses my home wifi network when i turn on the wifi. ð do better plz, thanks"
This app is extremely bad and borderline unusable and atrocious. This is coming from a loyal android user who tried iPhone a year ago and switched back. I never had an issue using ig on my iPhone. The app crashes. A lot. It's impossible to edit photos without it glitching. Developers were fully asleep when making the android app. Awful.
"I hate using this app. It has restrictive image sizes, You have to get sketchy third party apps to edit them properly, and half the time it doesn't even tell me I have messages. I have to keep reinstalling it just to get it to temporarily function. I only use this app because my friends do, but dang I hate it here. *Edit* I moved it to 1 star. Now its notifying of messages, but not showing them when I go to reply. I was being too generous before I guess."
"What is going on with your updates? I don't even want to use it anymore. The last month I have no reels, if I update or reinstall they are still not there. 1 time they came back after an update until I left the page, then they were gone again. If I click on an old shared reel in a message you can't scroll to the next. Posting pics adjusts them to a ridiculous position so I stopped doing that too. I've reported bugs multiple times with no fix. Fixing things that aren't broken is super annoying."
"App is super glitchy. Still annoyed that all videos have to be reels and can't just be posts, but that aside - picture cropping or adjustments don't save no matter how many times you edit them and click ""done"" resorting to cropping outside of the app to get around the problem which is silly for a photo sharing platform. And good luck trying to crop your reel cover photo icon and having that save (cause it won't)."
"Image quality from photos taken outside of Instagram in stories reduces them to a pixelated mess. Replies aren't showing what's replied to. Constant crashes. Lag. Auto refresh happens as soon as you load in new posts you haven't seen yet, whisking them away never to be seen again or at least without an annoying amount of digging. We don't want reels, we want a FUNCTIONING APP. Reporting also isn't reviewed by humans. Obvious hate speech is not removed by bot filters."
"fix your app!!! Every time I try to post with multiple pictures. the frame of my pictures from my camera, from the phone, will be completely cut and cannot be resized when you're in multiple selection. to post pictures on Instagram. And on top of that you cannot take a pictures, nor videos. in multiple select on Instagram to add to your selective amount of pictures that you want to post. It only counts as one picture."
"Most of the people I follow don't show up in my feed anymore. You have to do extra steps just to see them, otherwise it's almost exclusively Recommended posts. My likes get unliked most times, which is frustrating. Also with Likes, they made it harder to go and see past likes. Stories will glitch if you switch apps while making one. The list goes on. It's trying to be TikTok instead of Instagram, and it's a broken app to boot."
"Dealing with so many bugs and glitches in this app. The most annoying one is the DM inbox. Shows I have a new message but there's nothing in there. After closing the app countless times, I'll then receive it out of nowhere. Sometimes even weeks later which is insane. Insta has definitely went down hill."
"Honestly at first glance seems not too bad. However after you get used to the app all the flaws start piling up. It took over six months to get back into my account because they were not sending my reset email, but they were still sending the notification emails that I was getting on that account. Refused to help me get back in and I just got back in purely on luck alone."
"Doesn't do what it's supposed to do. It refused to send multiple videos over dm, when it decided to crash it gave me no options to save my videos, or even a chance to resend. Instagram threw out an entire days worth of photography without giving me the option of salvaging anything. As with any Meta product I am working diligently to ensure it's in my life as little as possible. This is an absolute embarassment of an app that was once known for its use by photographers. ""Shameful"" comes to mind."
I was encouraged to use IG when I started my catering business. I regret doing so. The platform constantly fails to upload my captions when I post pics/videos. The templates option is just okay. Posting on Instagram should not be nearly as painstaking as it is. I'm so tried of the app crashing. I've tried using different video editors to post as well. I'm just not impressed.
"Trying to make an in-feed post results in the app crashing, images not properly cropping upon posting, getting skewed strangely, all kinds of problems that used to never exist. I feel like I'm wasting my time when trying to use this platform when I'm trying to make a post to update family and friends about what I've been doing lately."
Almost unusable some days. Photo and reel editing is a nightmare - glitchy and doesn't save changes. Photos won't stay in the position you edit them to. Text will often just vanish after posting. Ridiculous. Something that should take 5-10 minutes to post can take twice as long just trying to make it comes out right. Not user friendly at all.
"It's alright I guess. Though when you have two account logins only one updates.. I've tried logging out of everything, redownloading the app and the other account I have still won't update. Also if you click on an ad link then back out the top and bottom goes white. It's fine for the most part when it comes to posting and taking picture (aside from an error every so often)"
"Just so many things wrong. Keeps crashing, when attempting to post reels or stories. When scrolling through stories it's ads between every story that are longer than the actual stories of stuff I care to see. On the actual feed I see maybe one friends post then ad and and other ad. Then freezes and crashes. No point in having this app."
"Outdated and glitchy- I stopped posting on this app years ago when I noticed my edits and captions were different after I posted. I work hard on my edits, positioning the photos, choosing the order, and writing a caption- but every time I post, all of that effort is erased. Same thing when Instagram posts on Facebook. What a waste of time. I don't know anyone who actually uses Instagram anymore anyway. Freeing up the space in my phone for an app that operates appropriately."
"no clue how the update made things worse. the app doesn't apply what notifications i choose to see so there's no point in my settings it seems like, editing videos and reels are still a pain, and the app still continues to glitch on me (for example, changing to light mode when i have it set to dark mode no matter what). and why can't we search for filters and sounds yet? still needs a lot of work"
"trying to post something on insta is the most infuriating process. It crashes, frames images randomly, and simply refuses to make the adjusments i want it to. also as a whole its a corrupt system that preys on your mental health for a quick buck. Basically, it comes at the cost of your ability to experience joy. other than that its fine."
"Somehow I was logged out of MY OWN ACCOUNT?! It's been 4 days and nothing has changed! It happened without any explaination too! Any interaction wasn't working when suddenly I was asked to confirm ownership. No confirmation e/gmail was sent to my address so I was, and currently am stumped. Already went to the apps Help Center for guidance, but to no avail. At the moment, if I try to log into the account the screen says ""loading"" or/and the app will suddenly stop and close itself."
"The app is very buggy for me,I have restarted the app and unstalled and reinstalled it,it is also annoying that the drafts are only saved for seven days. The reels aren't personalized and just random. There are also inappropriate bots that have been stalking my page, and it makes me uncomfortable to think that the app allows and creates fake profiles to stalk your page and that show inappropriate content without consequences. Especially since there are minors on the app."
"I used to really enjoy Instagram, but the updates over the last few years have really kiled it for me. I never ever see posts the people I'm following posts, and if I do it's an extreme fraction of it. It's even worse now that all I see are reels, and never actual PICTURE posts. Don't even get me started on how many ADS there are, it's obnoxious. 2 ads after every story?? That's absurd."
"Worrst app. I don't suggest anyone to use it. It wastes your time, data, money & energy as well. U can't reach even at level 1 until u buy diamonds. Call rates too high. This app causes device overheating which damages device very fast & consumes lot of data very fast. This app always try to reach to your privacy. It access your location without your permission."
"This app give update in every 2 days , if u update it u can't see a changes and too much bugs .. that's why this app stuck every second and lagging too much after update ... The last update is totally worst cause of potrait frames lagging too much can't play games anymore cause off too much lagging..."
Chamet has no customer service. I have yet to speak with one. Probably because they 500000 in diamonds for completing task's. So that aspect it's like there some scammers. It's hard to find a app that you can enjoy. If customer service would grow a pair and do what's correct id give them a 5 Star but because they want to steal from me they can hold one until the swelling goes down
What is this nonsense app I have purchased different this went purchased different which I don't want that please refund my money back. Now itself its too bad if you're doing like this everyone this app is fake and I tried to refund it but there is no option to get refund.. Please refund it or else I will file a case against this app everything in this app is fake. Refund my money immediately. This app doesn't have a proper customer service fully waste
"I recharged through top-up agency, after payment done no response from there side. No , support for this issue in your application, very worst. Now , who is incharge for my amount"
Complain I have account level 8 in chamet and I'm spending monthly on it from the time I reach this level I'm not getting any good returns for my gifts play I start feel bad about it Specially from one month the return is very bad and its almost nothing Only spending money without enjoying Am thinking to leave the application and find another one
"This app does not send text prompt for login, also your account is linked to your cell phone and you cannot change the number or password without receiving a text prompt. This is by far the stupidest security feature in the planet. More dumb than WhatsApp."
It's always I chat more but I just opened it so how come I chat when I do not open ? And when I opened it the they pop and say that like 61 minutes before I earned and then I close the app to wait and when I opened it it still the same i may do Radom calls but no beans it's free
My subscription rewards still not come..... The main thing this app is so expansive for call. If we call a lvl3 Or lv5 girls it Takes a lot of diamonds for one min like ( 3000 to 5000 diamonds ) it's expansive.... I think this app only used for developers and womens only .Not only men's who wanted to talk girls in this app..
"I have been trying to create agency on chamet but it is not sendinge OTP for agency, i have been trying with differet mobile number different devices but still the problem is same please help us with this i am in contact with many people who don't receive OTP"
The ads you guys have on other apps are annoying. The model you used isn't even good-looking and the narrator has such a flat tone.
Fully scam app in this I have purchased for more diamonds but purchased diamonds are different and money got debited from my bank account I am applying for refund but now there is no option for refund also this app is all fake making money there is nothing in this app.. I need a money to be refunded immediately. This app always have server down.. Always having a network problem because of that my money has been debited please refund it.
Please do not use this app.. it's addictive and you will lose a lot of money in it .. the people here are only thinking about the benefits and the pricing is ridiculous .. u buy 1 lak diamonds for 1600 and gift to some1 for example.. the host gets 60000 beans which is equivalent to 450 .. the app keeps most of the money to itself.. the lucky gifting is a scam and the game is absolutely ridiculous which u can't ever benefit out of ... Stay away from this app.. strongly not recommended
Is the customer service working? No one is answering may report. I didn't receive any diamonds after recharged in my channel with ID 31544578. Kindly fix immediately or else I want refund. I will rate this app 1 star for now while waiting for the problem to be solve
Doesn't all ways translate so you report it to Google pay and then before you know it charmet has band you with no chance of getting your remaining diamonds no warning just a message saying the manager has suspended your account. I think this is wrong. If you want to lose your money and what remaining diamonds you have this app is for you plan and simple STAY AWAY FROM THIS APPLICATION. You can't even contact them so if you recharge and don't get it. Too bad no support Stuff what so ever.
"They stopped accepting payment from the play store , when I input my They charged me 3 times , do not use your card on this it's a scam , GOOGLE please verify this app , for now I am not going use it till they accept Google pay"
As for now the application takes too much diamonds once u share a packet...and the system always bug especially during arriving of lucky packets it's not good anymore...sometimes when betting in games and u bet big amount they suddenly freeze and the bet is already lost...not good...I hope u can do action about this matter ...I only give 1 star
If the level 1 user can have the frame.. What is the special for having level 10 I'd.. There is no much difference.. And there is no special service for VIP customers..disappointed with the new update as there is no identity for the big users.... Uninstalling it..
"Zero star if I could I couldn't log in my former account after updating the app I created a new account,I did face verification and started streaming. Charmet changed my account from a female user to male user, disqualifying me from charmet star and rendering my earnings useless. I have complained but nothing was done. Stupid app,scam!! Nobody should download this app!"
"My experience was really awful, and I am never gonna use this app again. Also wamt to warn any other user who have this app delete it right now. This app is fooling everyone and doing a scam there are no real girls in this app there are only transgender boys who are pretending to be a girl. Worst application that I have ever used in my life.ð¡ð¤¬"
I hate when I answered call and the app says NO NETWORK CONNECTION even if I have a very strong internet connection. FIX IT. I CAN'T LIVE OR PICK UP CALLS. EDIT: AND ALSO NO RESPONSE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE.
"Hey chamet team.. I was unable retrieve my old account , which has been signed up by my gmail account...after one month I was not been able to get that account again...that was my level 7 account... Very poor app in this regard."
"Need another option of payment to purchase diamonds. Because some peoples have using phonepe, gpay and etc.. But ur app access only gpay payment. Why? There are many options available. So why ur app redirect to gpay link.."
New version update is too much useless because this time chamet doesn't give task for free call & if you want to call someone the diamond was too much expensive
"It was nice at first, I joined two weeks ago and now it is not nice anymore....I'm a female and I was stopped from receiving random calls they said I have received it too much, please fix this so we can be receiving unlimited random calls"
"The previous version of deleting the chat was much easier than this version. If you sir language wise it is not showing properly. Example if I sort by Kannada language it showing Phillipines, Hindi, Bengali and all other stuffs but Kannada. Same thing for other languages also. Update sucks."
The previous version was best for getting chat easier but latest version becomes too tuft for getting chart cards faster than the previous version plz do easier
"I reached more than 30000 diamonds by recharging and consumption.but still it's showing My level is in zero.After I reached 10000 I got level one.but after few days I reached 30000 diamonds by recharging, but now my level is zero.Really disappointed.Not recommend for download this app"
"half the time features don't work and there is no support at all, the in app help page just is a pre-drafted msg space which does not relate or resolve any of your queries"
"Hi there's a debit of â¹285 from my account but same amount coins not credited yet, kindly refund the amount or credit the coins to my account"
Recharged 6 times and haven't got the coins still. The customer service team also didn't respond.
Unable to open app ...just the black screen it is showing .... Latest update ruined how many things still countimg .....
"After update yesterday,there is no option to send person message to streamer,there is no send button option"
This app only good in new user but when you reach level 5 you cannot get free calls from male users. And randoms are sucks coz it suspends when your yellow lines empty
Why does your app access to our media that ie photos and videos isn't that sneaking into someone's personal account does your app keep the data safe or your app stores all personal things is it safe?
The shytty new race game crashesy chamet anytime I click on it. Also pick 1 race game. Don't need 2 race games.
This is my account i'm not able to use my diamonds as i recharged the account properly what the hell is going on no customer service is available on the app also
Video calling quality are absolutely not clear. Very disappointing experience.
Expensive and very strict I love the old version!!!! Don't spend money in this app!!!
Purchased diamonds but didn't add up and my balance was cut!!! Horrible app
No ways to contact the team if you face any issues you people didn't reply yo any issues worst service here been here for more than 2 year and yet the worst service
Buggy app. With no support after spending money. Only they care for earning but no user support
that is a chargeable and without recharge there is no option for chat
I just paid for 2 of the $29.99 of diamonds and 2 of the $9.99 diamonds and did not receive the diamonds i always spend money here and why is this happening
Did recharge three times and nothing... No diamonds... Tried to contact the support and no reply from them too...
Pathetic App will never going to recharge and use this app. Before even a minute they charge diamond. Worst experience.
How can chamet take location even those rights are not given. My location is not shared with chamet app but with new virsion it showing your location in profile. If location is not allowed then chamet app using backdoor to access your phone location.. who knows what else they are capturing or stealing from your device
There such a more issues on your app more bug on games and gift waste money.
I've purchased diamond ð twice during private call money deducted from my account twice and I didn't receive any diamond this is really unacceptable I'm really disappointed with this app I have complained but there is no action and no refunds
"Only gives five times to talk, that too gets cut automatically, then asks to talk with money. This app is very ridiculous."
"Useless app keeps banning Someone for no reason, beans rate very high And they charge much Newbe call charge 2000 app takes 800 then rewards 1200 very bad 3000 app takes 1200 and rewards 1800 so poor Try changing it please and the way u ban us really terrible reduce the way u ban it's making the app really boring"
"So as a host,I have had some sort of horrible experiences with you people.With all the stress we go through,you ban host for 12 hrs for unnecessary reasons.I've sent your developer a message as I await the reason why you had to capture me when I wasn't streaming live and gave me a 1 day ban.This simply shows your level of irresponsibility.Be sure to reply mail as soon as you can.This is the second time this is happening and I know some people that have had same experiences."
Wrong application and not showing the good results
Wrost app. Don't install this. There is wastage of your time and your money. You will spent your money but there is very ad output for you. So I am requesting you all that not to install this app
Being rated poorly as a paying customer is bad for business. Only women or people with payouts registered should have ratings on their profile. Its not fair to be rated poorly especially if the person I call is in a bad mood or just rated people poor. Also random chat should go back to the way it was before. It was better the old way. Now random chat is slower.
"Several time failed when i recharge my account..the errors come like ""the transaction is declined due to suspicious activity."
"I have any free call , & I don't use because random call , . If you want give free call please and Please give to we want to call , and not to random call , so frust series talk ,. Hope can solved this problem. ð"
"Dear chamet I can not recover my account which was not connected with any google , phone etc but it automatically on when I try to join chamet , but after update there is only two options phone and google not join option kindly help me I know my nickname only"
Fake app Bczz i Have completed a task for free diamonds by downloading an app and signup there but i didnt get any diamond yet really fake app very bad exp.
There must be a option to see your previous chat history but unfortunately there is no such option in these app. Plz take this as a suggestion ð

Constant server and connectivity issues
"Tasks stopped working, fix the app"
"The app is great but the constant banning of the hosts is too much, the app was created for fun so why not allow the hosts to feel very comfortable streaming instead of them feeling threat of constant ban for no reasons? And the program robot for complaint doesn't even work at all, so why complaining when nothing is done?"
I give only 1 star the recharge prices are too high and call rates . Pls the prices of buy diamond is reduce . I am very disappointed.
"What an app it is today, once again I did balance and I didn't get my diamond, even before this problem has come and I have told. Why don't you guys do it fix....and this review of ours has any benefit to you guys.....neither you guys do it fix nor any reply."
Cant use free cards to call anyone. Random match is worst!!! Nobody is liking it.
Removed the translation option during the host is live. Unable to communicate effectively
"Hello chamet team This new update doesn't allow me to watch other countries carnival event, kindly look into this issue as soon as possible..thank you"
All features are needs diamonds and pays every time. This app is for the girls only because the boys are always spend time and money while the girls are spending time but earn money. Why this app allows only girls earn only money?
experience with this app is very bad lot of dirty photos in this app. Google remove this app from playstore
Monthly pass is useless because previous it provided more diamonds while buying monthly pass . But now diamonds are reduced in current monthly pass . Please provide more diamonds in monthly pass or remove monthly pass permanently

"Formula is simple get maximum minutes once you call, you are fortunate if you get what you want else most broadcasters are instructed to take your minutes ultimately ur money which is 98%. Think 200 times before you buy coins. This is to the most disappointing app once you pay money"
Worst app ever I had recharged and I was scrolling through the discover option and I accidentally pressed the call option and the host pick that call before I could cut and I lost 5000 diamonds . Pathetic and worst it wasn't even a 1 sec call screw ur app what kind of algorithms are u using
Why I can't verify my phone number. I need to bind my number. I entered the right code but it keep saying I enter the wrong one. Whyyy??? Pls fix.
"Today I have been trying to get the free rewards but whenever I am clicking on ""play"" option to watch short video so I can get the free rewards then popup comes (""today's rewards used up, come tomorrow), though from morning till the time I didn't receive any rewards.

Wrost app i recharge monthly pass but didn't open monthly pass and money did not back
"Once upon a time, this was an excellent app for language learning. Unfortunately, I no longer think that's the case. The app is heavily gamified - and not in a way that's conducive to education. It incentives doing lessons that are easily repeatable, or reward more XP, not those that expand your vocabulary or improve your grammar (which are necessarily slower). As someone with a 2000+ day streak, I can safely say that's the only reason I haven't moved to something else. Use anything else."
"This app is HORRIBLE! Choose another app to learn a language. This was a huge waste of time to install. When I tried to register the speaking exercises, it froze, making me have to start the lesson ALL OVER AGAIN! ðâ ï¸ð Though the people on duolingo are really nice. Also, whenever I speak it never takes it and gets it wrong. ð¢ There is also a glitch when I'm doing a lesson. When I hit the next button, it disappears and I can't continue."
"I used to absolutely love this App and felt encouraged to put in the time for multiple lessons with the old design. It actually felt like I was learning the language versus just meeting a ""daily"" check off. The new design has caused my learning to go towards the latter. The new layout is cumbersome and fails to really harden any learning. I started noticing I wasn't retaining what I learned as well and have decided to look for a different app. I even paid for premium and now canceled."
It's useful at first but quickly gets boring. I bought a one year subscription and now use the app just to go through the year. I dread it. The examples for my German lessons are silly and unrealistic. Who talks about parrots and rabbits and ex's and in-laws all the time? Totally useless to anyone who wants to learn how the natives actually talk. The app also does little to expand my vocabulary or help me to speak in a more sophisticated way. I started using podcasts and YouTube videos instead.
"Duolingo's lessons are quick and are fine for drilling vocabulary. It also has a Stories section, which lets you listen to language in context. Grammar explanations are lacking and their sentences are repetitive and contrived. You are also punished for wrong answers, which is a counterproductive teaching strategy, especially since answers are sometimes marked wrong incorrectly, penalizing you for their mistakes. It's convenient and can help you get started but that's about it."
"I paid for an annual subscription just before the huge change to a single learning path on 11/1/2022. Although never really a fan of the huge ""gamification"" aspect (some gaming elements would be fine for motivational purposes, but IMO Duolingo went overboard), prior to the 11/1 update, the app overall was really great. After the removal of the learning tree system and change to a single path, the learning process became far more convoluted. I'll be learning elsewhere. Wish I could get my $ back!"
"Recent updates have significantly slowed progression through the courses. The 3rd, 4th, 5th time you see a topic there is no way to skip material you have already mastered without skipping a significant portion of other material that you may still need. I do think the new learning path is better and more intuitive than the previous experience; but the execution of it is so poor than it not only negates all of the positives but sums to a significantly worse experience overall."
"The ""hints"" are completely broken and have been for years. Speech recognition can't recognize even the most basic words spoken incredibly slowly. They'll say you have a typo in your answer, when your answer was constructed from a word bank they provided so there is literally no way to not have the ""typo"" (usually a contraction like ""you're""). You'll never get a response if you have problems with the app. All around awful. I wish negative stars were possible."
"Yesterday I'd have given five stars. Today it's telling me that the same sentences that were correct yesterday are incorrect today, wanting me to use words it hasn't taught me yet. This is an terrible experience for someone trying to learn. If you want to change the words used, teach us the new word. If I haven't been taught it yet, I can't just pull it out of thin air! And in these cases, the clickable hints haven't been helpful, because when I click on the word, the new word isn't on the list!"
"It's a GAME! But it doesn't always track your score properly. If you like games, it may keep you in the routine of learning and listening... however, it will also frustrate and aggravate anyone who is actually capable of keeping track of the lessons you have completed. Glitch upon glitch!"
"Used Duolingo years ago and loved it. Tried it again recently and you've overhauled the UI, added pointless time-wasting animations and snippets, destroyed the lesson structure to a one-path road, and in general the content feels less intuitive and helpful than it was previously. Even with a paid subscription your heavy ""encouragement"" for time-wasting clickathon content would make the experience inconvenient thus unusable. Moving to another provider."
"Why did they have to make ""improvements""? Everytime they do something breaks. With the latest round it's the ability to add or follow back friends. Both end with either ""an error occurred"" or the added friend disappears once the so is reopened. The developers stopped responding to help requests a couple of years ago. This app has become nothing more than a money grab since the company went public."
"updated review: Been using DL off/on for years, currently on a 220+ streak, primarily Japanese. When the big overhauld hit at the start of the year, it removed a lot of features I think were useful, including stories, which was imo the best for realistic listening comprehension. In the last few days there has been another (smaller) update that seems to have completely lost my lesson progress and set me back to almost lesson 1 (I am N5 proficient). It's just frustrating and miserable to use now."
"This app does a terrible job of explaining the grammar rules of the language it's ""teaching"". They throw random sentences at you with little to no explanation about how to form sentences. Then, after you've struggled through dozens of lessons, they finally explain. The whole formula is backwards, and I find myself constantly using Google to learn the grammar rules. This app is ok for practicing things you know, but if you want to learn something new, this isn't the right app."
Duolingo app is worse than ever before!!!! Keeps freezing on the page where you need the keyboard. It just freezes and then just randomly restarts. I spend more time screaming at this app than I do practicing French. This app sucks so bad I can't stand it. Every single update it gets worse and worse and worse. Do they not even test out these new update???? I HATE DUOLINGO
"The lives system is idiotic. Making mistakes is past of the learning experience. And yet. If you make too many, you are punished by not being able to continue learning unless you watch ads or use the in app currency you get from completing quests. But I feel that getting in app currency and competitive tiurnaments detracts from the learning experience as lessons become less about learning and more for the sake of getting currency and being at the top of the leaderboards"
"I was working my way though the Japanese course, but the latest update reset my progress. Now the new course is expecting me to know words that were never taught and understand sentence structure that wasn't covered in the previous course. It's very discouraging to feel like you've been sent back to square one. Please provide a way to revert to the old lesson plan."
"This app is terrible. It's so buggy, and they forcibly switch you from one language course to another without any warning. That makes it so that you can never actually finish working on a language course or keep track of your progress. Their PM's are clearly morons who have never heard of the term ""Delightful Experience."""
The new format of the app removed all grammar tips and explanations from the lesson descriptions (guidebooks) and it has no way to turn off the cartoon characters that appear inside lessons. You give me two different ways to translate the same word? I want to know when I should be using each one! They have not restored the grammar info despite repeated feedback with screenshots showing that it is missing. I am looking for a new language app and will uninstall Duolingo once I find one.
"On top of still not liking the new app, the app is very laggy and filled with bugs. The app crashes in the middle of lessons and all your progress is lost. I have used gems to do timed challenges and the app would crash during the lesson and I would lose my 10 gems. This has happened at least 4 times. I redeemed the night owl XP boost to double my XP and my XP wouldn't double when it took several lessons during the boost. The app is almost unusable now."
"It's a game, pure and simple. Don't plan on being fluent or having a college-level experience -- despite what the ads say, it's not true. It is what it is: a game. However, there is no customer service, many answers are wrong (my native French tutor refuses to allow her students to use it because of this ). In addition, it's not really much of a game. It routinely shorts you points when you complete one of the ""'skill"" levels, and, again, there is no way to contact anyone about this."
"Initially Duolingo seemed like a fun and easy way to learn a new language or at least brush up on old ones. However as you get deeper into the sections it tends to throw in random words it expects you to know without a real idea of what it is until you get it wrong. When you get something wrong it tells you the ""correct"" answer without telling you why, all while subtracting a heart. The heart system is also annoying as is the constant notification spam. This is one of the worst language apps."
"I lost a near 5 year streak because I couldn't make it on until 11:59pm due to traveling. It switched to midnight, and there goes streak. Now I can finally say good riddens. This app used to be good, but it went downhill last year and I've been keeping my streak hoping they would fix it, but no they haven't. I will celebrate by moving to another language app, where I can actually learn instead of just competing and going over the same stuff all the time for max points."
"It's absolutely infuriating how wrong a lot of stuff is. I had some friends ask for help with their Spanish course in here, so I decided to take a look for myself. So many wrong answers and I've sent in feedback without seeing any corrections. Words and grammar are completely wrong, plus I've been cheated out of hundreds of XP points because of some glitch. I've done so many of my lessons in other languages without seeing my XP points add up. This app is ridiculous! And they ignore my emails!"
This app has a bug where it will undercut points for completed lessons or not give you points at all. Super frustrating when your grinding lessons only to realize your efforts for points were wasted. The point system will screw you in a variety of ways: 1. Not count double XP as double and only award single points 2. Show your points correctly only to remove all points from a session when you leave the app and enter again 3. Just not give you any points at all for a completed lesson. Thx Duo ð
"I used to like duolingo a lot but everything has changed. they have hearts now and it's very frustrating because if I lose all my hearts I have to do practice sessions to make it up and that doesn't help at all. also, whenever I don't do it for a couple of days it'll send me notifications that say ""taking a learning vacation?"" and that annoys me so much"
"I had the premium for a year but it didn't feel worth it to keep, and that was before the change to the new learning path. For Japanese each lesson has at least 1 pronunciation mistake where the onyomi is used instead of kunyomi (and vice versa). The ""guidebooks"" are just phrasebooks; not helpful when learning new concepts at all. Duolingo is somehow now more boring than doing my Anki reviews. I honestly don't know why I keep up with it. I learn more from immersion, Anki, and Tae Kim guides."
"You used to be able to go back and review without losing hearts and losing access. Now 20 minutes into review after having to take a break and I'm locked out. This is incredibly detrimental to the learning environment they formerly supported. It's gone from a simple learning app to a buy as you go, battle for gems, and meaningless point multipliers that hinder my progress and make the app all the more frustrating. I wish I could return to the original version."
"Lately, the app was getting worse. There are so many times I encountered the sentences not being read out loud, even tapping on the speaker icon does nothing, sometimes tapping on each word in this case reads them out, sometimes it doesn't, and then it works fine again for the next sentence. This is absolutely frustrating especially when you are on a time challenge where slowing down to tap on each individual text to read them out instead slow you down tremendously. Please fix!!"
"I dislike the new update. It makes knowing where I am in the course super difficult. If I might make a suggestion, keep the old map, but when you click on a section it opens a mini map with all these little segments in it. Or make the units collapsable. Then you can see all the units. It's just a hassle to swipe through everything to get somewhere."
"The recent update is terrible. I was encouraged by the progress I was making before. I'm regretting the $84 investment that prior to this update was more than worth it. The gains that I built on from earlier lessons are getting lost with this new layout. What happened to the revisit reminder feature?! The navigation is bulky and unclear, and I've forgotten a lot as a result. The large button speaking practice freeze remains unresolved. It's really unfortunate, a change or a canceled subscription"
"Really frustrated that they've removed the option to type out your answers. It takes away a level of challenge and flexibility that's needed to attain proficiency in a language. It also literally slows me down because I spend so much time looking for the word bubbles that fit what I'm trying to translate. Also, it removes the possibility of using my speech to text option on my phone which allows me to give myself more spoken practice in the first place. Terrible changes."
"Used to be great. The latest major update dumbed down the learning path so you can no longer choose topics. New format is slow with too much review. You can't test out of individual lessons anymore, only the full chapter, which wouldn't be so bad except you can see what's in the later lessons until you finish the earlier ones... Overall, the app is now painfully tedious and boring by comparison with no freedom or variety. We had a family subscription, but I'm not renewing."
"I've used Duolingo for four years now. Long story short: the new updates are terrible. The ""learning path"" make learning tedious and doesn't encourage reviewing older material. Now this app is pretty much useless for learning and retaining content. They got rid of the forums, replacing it with guidebooks that do absolutely nothing to help understand grammatical concepts. And now they get rid of typing lessons, too? It's like they're trying to make it as unhelpful as possible."
"I have been a Duo user for over 5 years , Recently Duo made big changes to their progran. Unfortunately, not for the good. The program is now extremely hard to connect to and once in the program, it is very difficult to stay connected. I have to close the program and reopen it iin my browser. Changes have eliminated the 'tips' and 'discussion' sections. This was how Duo taught the language. Now i have to learn by guessing. Not a good way to learn, and I paid for the non ad version!"
"Annoying way of learning. Don't buy the fancy deal. It is not much different. Without it, you won't be on the leader boards very easily, but just know that it isn't because you are not learning. It's because duolingo is greedy and tries to monetize on everything you do. Don't hit the power ups where you can earn extra points either. None of them go toward your total score unless you win the whole game... which is impossible without paying. You do learn, but at what cost. Unintalling."
"Duolingo takes the fun out of learning a new language. It's draining, and spams you with notifications and emails. You get brunt out because of the repetitiveness of it all. The new update doesn't really teach you new things, it just repeats the same thing over and over and over. It makes you memorize things instead of learning them. And with this, it's hard to navigate and the looks aren't aesthetically pleasing. I remember the jokes they made about how creepy the app is, and they're not wrong."
"UPDATE: STILL 1 STAR! The app is hands down better than it used to be. However, getting stuck in a lengthy story I have to be able to have audio and hear will keep the app 1 star until programmers come to their senses. Lessons are acceptable in quality, but the required stories have kept me in the same spot for a month and half until I could remember to set aside time where it's quiet and I can defeat the on the go purpose of the app to do their ten minute story you can't accelerate at all."
"I have made many accidental purchases as anyone in their lives, but so far there have been no problem with reimbursements in Google Play. However, with Duolingo it was not the case. As per their instructions, I cancelled my subscription before requesting a refund. So after being denied a refund (made, mind you, almost immediately after the purchase) I was denied the service. 80 euros down the drain. I don't even want to touch the free version. Disappointed."
"I loved this app for the longest time, but after the most recent update, its turned to garbage. I'm using it to study Spanish and before the update, it constantly gave you refreshers to keep you constantly reminded of what you had already studied. But now, its just constantly progressing forward, regardless of how well somebody knows the material. I just got done with a lesson where I didn't even know half of the words. It's just turned into freemium garbage. Seems like it wants you to fail."
"The new update is terrible to navigate and the ability to review completed lessons is gone. I can pass a lesson fairly easily but that does not mean the knowledge is cemented in my brain. Many many reviews are required. I need to find a new app. **Update 3/5/2023 I have stuck it out due to friends joining. No resolution to issues. Additionally, it is extremely frustrating that the timed bonuses (early/late bird) are not reliably available when they say they will be despite contacting support."
"Love the new path layout, the directed learning is very engaging and more effective. Lots of ads but none with super, which is worth the cost, esp. with the contributions they make to schools. But I recently lost the option to use the keyboard, which makes the lessons too easy and incredibly tedious. Experimenting with various possible answers without risking hearts is what made the subscription worth the cost. I'm barely holding on to my streak hoping you guys fix this soon."
I've been using Duolingo for 833 days in a row. I enjoyed my experience before. The new system stinks. Besides now they are making me use the heart system and giving me the adds...what is the point of my subscription then?! It is impossible to reach out to anyone to fix it. They need to fix it because I am no longer motivated and ready to cancel. (The new system does not give as solid of a teaching as well)
"Really enjoyed it until the new update with the terrible layout. It's not easy to track what I've done so I end up repeating things. It's also more difficult to find a lesson that I'd want to repeat for practice. I have a streak that is over 1000 days, but I'm seriously considering ending it and deleting the app because it's simply not fun anymore. The current layout is garbage!!"
"WORTHLESS, DON'T DO IT!! The same sentences, topics, over and over again - I'm in unit 16, thrn suddenly, it's the same topics, phrases, sentences, etc, but now they're giving the same words as before, only different tenses - without translating or teaching them 1st. I started with top scores. Now, they're ""testing"" using new words and tenses w/out 1st TEACHING them. So, I can't get anywhere near the top. If it's a good app, you shouldn't have to have a dictionary, internet, or other apps w/it."
My biggest issue is the lack of parity among different apps. February was one of my most productive months but I'm going to miss the February badge by one single quest due to the fact that quest aren't shown on web. Which is half of where I choose to utilize my daily practice. Additionally mobile lacks some features from web as well. Duo is good for memorizing vocabulary. But not much else. There's a huge quality difference between different courses.
"It's ok if you aren't paying for it but the fact that everyone I know that uses it pays a different price for the Pro is suspicious. Prices vary from $6.00 a month to $13.00 a month to have the exact same content, it's enough to turn me away . Update- Now they have little pop ups to "" go legendary"" that block some of your lessons unless you are paying. Not a huge deal but very much a frustration when you need to brush up on older lessons."
"This is one of the worst language apps I've used. If you get something wrong it doesn't tell you WHY it's wrong. It just shows you the ""correct"" answer. The little snipit of Grammer at the beginning of each unit isn't enough information to actually learn anything useful. Not to mention the actual units more often than not have nothing to do with the Grammer tips supplied. The hearts are also annoying because I have to stop learning from the lesson I was on and go practice some random lesson."
"The new layout takes away being able to get double points with reward chests. And you already can't use rewards for double points on timed lessons and ramps. So there is almost no point in double point rewards. Which is the whole point of doing lessons at 6am 6pm. The new layout doesn't make anything easier. It makes it too long to scroll to old lessons for review. I absolutely hate the new layout and events suck so bad.. everytime you guys update, I like the app less and less. Starting to suck"
"I've been with Duo for about 4 years but I hate the recent format change. Its not working for me. On the tree format I was constantly progressing. Yes, it was repetitive but I needed that to grind it into my brain. On the new format I am not. I get moved on too soon. Now I'm discouraged and looking for an alternative."
"This app is still disappointing since the major overhaul. I have to go back and get 40 legendary trophies just to progress further than I originally was AND i have to get . On top of that, I have noticed many words are translated differently than they were the first couple years I was learning so that basically ruins my progress with memorizing them! Nothing is even really in categories anymore either so you never know exactly what your getting into with new lessons. So frustrating!"
"Great great way to learn languages. But no customer support, even with Plus. Update: Had family plus for a year & everyone loved it. But couldn't afford the single payment renewal. The commercials on basic are one thing, but make 5 mistakes in 1 lesson & that's it for the day. 4 hrs to regenerate 1 heart. You can't take part in the league challenges without paying for EACH round. Nor review your mistakes. So much for wanting everyone to learn. Only those with $. We will find another app"
"The app is getting worse all the time. Lately every few months I erased a star. They just took off all my old lessons. No more recap. Now I don't recognize most of the words in the lessons they are giving me. I completely lost interest. I'll try a new language, maybe I'll get used to it form the beginning. I feel too invested to quit after 3 years, but that's where I'm heading."
"This app has been consistently taking away features that were useful and effective for language learning. Not just for free users, but paid subscriptions as well. This app used to explain some of the grammar to you. Something extremely useful for someone like me who is a native English speaker but was learning Russian and Korean. They changed the path system to force you to learn more linear Not being able to type out my answers was the final straw for me. I will NOT be renewing my subscription."
"The unnecessary cartoon characters and locking features behind a pay wall might be acceptable if not for the frequent and unexplained crashes. This app was a lot better before the developers decided to add those looking cal arts style cartoon characters. Seriously, the world has enough of that garbage without the learning applications adding to it. If the developers really cared about making learning free, they would unlock all of the features and make the paid version ad free."
"Your app told me I lost my streak after I completed a lesson for no reason, I didn't even actually lose my streak in the app. Really rubbed me the wrong the way cause my streak is something I'm somewhat proud of. Also the lessons are extremely repetitive, please accelerate the pace of intermediate lessons so I don't have to repeat the same conjugations like I have for the past couple months. At least add SOME more different vocab. Also the new layout sucks. Stories should not be in the main trak"
"New update introduced significantly worse ads, they now seen to play all the time and with sound. I hate you Duolingo and if this does not change soon I am abandoning this app as it is already one of the worst ways to learn a language. It's fun, but it doesn't really teach you the language, it just gives you practice. Yes I am willing to give up a 100+ day streak over this. I can take ads, but not when they have sound blasting my ears after every single gd lesson."
"04/23 edit â somehow things are worse. I've been taking Irish since 2022. They've recently updated with more 'voices,' most computer generated. These are poor quality, too fast, & sometimes leave out entire words. I'm a visual learner. The new 2023 layout is somehow overwhelming and vague at the same time. Excessive scrolling over nothing. Can't read lesson categories anymore without selecting them. It's substantially harder to review a specific topic now. Feels like a downgrade."
"Constantly claims I don't have a profile despite being shown as logged in on other pages of the app... Horrendously annoying bait & switch tactic. Wow, the updated version is so much worse. It's allotting more time to ""Temu"" ads (such high volume chimes I have tinnitus in one ear now and can't hear the words in the app clearly) and animations than actual learning. It also deleted my progress in partially completed units. So I'll spend more time ""learning new words"" I already learned yesterday."
"I don't like the constant updates. I need to learn at my own pace and the app keeps doing these updates and telling me where to start where it ""thinks"" I should be. Usually it's too difficult where it is telling me to start. In addition, twice, I finished my lesson before midnight and the app resets the streak even though I completed the lesson in its entirety."
"Recent update makes the app horrible I was using it to learn Irish, and it was great. But they recently replaced the audio for the language and the current version moves too fast and sounds absolutely horrible, and things are mispronounced. I'd been doing really well and had a decent streak going but now I'm not going to use it anymore. It's unfortunate."
"I've used duo for years and I've noticed that now it's more about getting you to spend money on it than it is about teaching you a language. When I first started using it years ago, it was great for learning but now it's really hard to actually learn anything without being asked to purchase hearts, streak freezes, or gems. The new layout is also horrible and was never fixed. Would recommend getting a language workbook off Amazon instead."
"I've been with Duolingo since 2018, and was subscribed to Duolingo Plus. When they rolled out the update that implemented the new ""path"" system, I had a really hard time but stuck with it. After 3 months of putting up with it, I deleted the app. The update took away everything great about the app. It took away choice and forces you into a very linear pathw, when before you could choose what to learn and how. Many users agree which is why they shut down the forums. I use Babbel now! :)"
"I'm honestly fine with the new changes to the lesson systems, overall. They give you more practice and repetition for language and you can test out of them if you've got the hang of it early. What I absolutely will not tolerate, however, is their gradual removal of typed answers. I rarely ever get to type my own answers anymore and I simply won't have it. I'll find some other way to learn a language. It's infinitely slower to use the stupid bubbles than it is to type my own answers."
"Duolingo at first seems like a good way to learn a language, and to a certain extent that's true. However, it only teaches you the basics, and with it's ridiculous heart system you will slowly find yourself dreading to do any lessons in fear of making a mistake, and given that it's lessons are driven by AI you will make MANY. Learning a language is hard, Duolingo makes it harder. Save yourself the hassle and pay for babel or anything else. Dropped another star. Not worth it!"
"Nonworking Ads! So except for rare occasions I go once a day at least because I want to learn as many languages as possible! Problem, before I can get credit for completing a lesson I have to watch an ad. What happens when I complete the lesson but the ad doesn't show the page where I get credit? Turns out, I have to do it over or risk losing my perfect streak! My health doesn't always allow me to do that so I end up using my streak freeze but I should get credit not bad ads!"
"Came back to this app revently. The update is awful. It makes things harder to navigate and progression feels worse when it's on this rigid and linear path. In addition, the over-monetization is ridiculous. Too many ads, notifications, and pushes to pay for the full version. Monetization is fine, but it seems like the longer a popular app exists, the more greedy it gets despite it somehow getting worse with each update. That's where we're at now with Duolingo."
"I used to love Duolingo, the pronunciation of each foreign word sounded realistic and there were stories that went along with each lesson. I also enjoyed duocards (which they removed along with the stories). This, of course, has made me incredibly disappointed with Duolingo. Although I do enjoy the guidebook and animations, it's not enough for me to want to keep this on my phone."
"Difficult to report bugs. Run into a series bug. Lost 5 hearts, the reporting is very time consuming and there is no direct link within the app. Had to do it on the laptop and transfer multiple screenshots. Lost an hr trying to pass the bug and then resorting it. I'm disappointed that Duo rolled out new type of exercise without adequate testing. The adds occasionally stall, and I have to restart the app. I lost a streak freeze because the add stalled at 23:59. then didn't counted as completed"
"I have been using duo since 2017, started out enjoying it, actually loved it but as of now, NOT so much, starting to HATE them. I'm not a fan of the new changes, the straight path to learning, not to mention they keep stealing my points and gems from me, and the videos for points keep freezing, you have to close the app to get out of the video, you don't get the points and you have to start your lesson over. I have repeatedly contacted them thru feed back & reporting a bug. My feedback disabled."
"(Edit (3/24) : brought it down to 1 star because ive tried for over 3 years to get a streak going, and lost it after 63 days, even though i know i had streak freezes. Absolutely through with this app.) Have used Duolingo for over 4 years, and used love the service, but the new UI update is not only clunky and rudimentary, but eliminates the ease and accessibility that the Unit tree structure offered. Fed up with Duo ruining the best features of the app."
Kind of fun but truly not useful. Been learning the same old phrases and words for two months now. Duolingo doesn't challenge you to learn more. It gives you a handful of basics and then shows them to you over and over again for months. This app claims it teaches fluency. That's a lie. It doesn't teach much. Just the bare minimum. This app is not a great use of your time.
"This app is full of bugs! My microphone will work once and then stop working. Today, the words I typed were filling in over the given words so I couldn't even read what I typed. Now I'm trying to write sentences with pre-selected words and the page continually freezes. I cannot scroll to the window where I'm supposed to write."
"The game was going well until I got to the lessons on where I have to make a sentence. I can't see much of the beginning of the sentence and there's no space to type my part. It's like my screen is too small or something, but it works all the other times for the other things. It's not something I can skip. I just have to keep quitting the game and hoping if I start over it works. Well it's not working and now I'm at a stand still.This is frustrating after going that far."
"requires a LOT of data and must be online to use at all. doesn't follow settings. keeps repeating tasks I'd choose to never do so the effort is blocked. even worse, three days into using the app the adds are showing almost twice as long. this app isn't worth the adds, and definitely not worth the price they demand to get rid of the offensive adds. just because you offer a cheap product with tons of abusive advertising doesn't make it valuable. free my... free to delete."
The redesign of the app a few months ago forced users into massed practice - the principle that one should focus on a single topic until it is mastered and then move on. The problem is that massed practice is ineffective and time wasting based on literally all research performed on it. Mastery is an illusion. Bouncing around topics to give yourself time to forget a bit between sessions is the most effective way of learning via recall practice. This is no longer an option in the app.
"The last update changed everything I liked about the app. I used to enjoy rereading stories and lessons to reinforce what I learned. Now there is almost no stories, and little explanation of the lessons, the new vocabulary, and the listening exercises are unclear. Bring back the older version that is still used in other countries. And now the app does not replenish the hearts at midnight or overnight like it has for over 560 days. If they are trying to get money out of me, I will go elsewhere"
"This game used to be fun but unless you are paying for it, it's nearly impossible to get anything accomplished. Also will penalize you for simple spelling errors (which honestly sometimes occur with autocorrect), causing you to lose a heart which will often times lead to you losing all your hearts and then you can't do lessons. Sometimes you can save yourself if you are rich and can afford to buy the gems that are painstakingly heart to get but are super easy to spend to save yourself. Smh"
"I only ever used the web app because it offered the choice to never use the word bank and type everything by hand. They have removed that option for the majority of lessons now seemingly without reason, and it has drastically lowered the usefulness of the browser version. I've cancelled my super subscription and will not be renewing it unless this change is reverted, for the life of me I don't understand the thought process behind this change. Just leave it as an option for those who want it."
"Recent updates really discouraged my learning. The lessons are 2x-4x longer than usual. Seems like a bid to push people into running out of hearts. Longer lessons mean more chances to make a mistake. Too many and youâll have to buy hearts with gems, wait for a refill, or upgrade to Duolingo plus. Rarely hit the limit but itâs incredibly frustrating to take something I could reliably spend a few minutes on each day and turn it into something thatâs sporadically lusting after my time and money."
"The new updated layout is absolutely terrible. I can no longer see what exact type of lesson I want to practice. Just vague categories. Hopefully they do a rollback, or old layout option. I may uninstall after two years of using this app. 2023 edit- For Japanese learners, they've absolutely ruined the experience. They give you words you haven't seen with no content or instruction so you lose hearts, all to encourage paying. They halved xp gains so it becomes super grindy to be in the leagues."
As someone with ADHD having a way to learn in short or long bursts is great! I don't like the heart system as when you're in the zone you have no choice but to break from it or shell out yet more money same as everywhere it's tiring. The constant notifications and the competition system is hurtful to my mental health and progress as it conflicts with how my brain motivates itself with ADHD/autism. Found a way to turn it off but now receive even more notifications telling me to turn it on.
"Still cannot recommend free version unless you have the patience of a saint and unlimited time. Sadly, developer monetizes everything - from buying ""streaks"" to extending time for timed exercises. Overall, boring repetition, cartoonish childish approach that is distracting, and a push to compete with others that is quite annoying. Only using because I made the BIG mistake of paying. Not aimed at folks who truly just want to learn."
"The new update makes it harder to tell what you are doing, the XP has gotten downright stingy, and to top it off, the ads crash 9 out of 10 times, robbing you of any rewards. If I didn't already have a streak, I'd delete it, and I might anyway. Edit: The app never gives you gems for the first daily goal. It robs you of gem rewards constantly. The ""feedback"" button is just a social media share button. No actual feedback. Shame on you Duo. ETA: Now it crashes during the rewards. No shame."
"There is no way to learn from this app. It is totally useless in all ways, shapes, and forms. I could learn more of another language by getting hit in the head repeatedly by a language book. One tip they had was to write down things so you can study them. Well that doesn't work to well when every thing you write down from the app is wrong according to the same app. Waste of time and money. I encourage everyone to uninstall this app and just simply bang your head against a wall til you learn one."
"I used to love Duolingo, it was fun and I could take my Norsk lessons at my own pace, I could choose which lesson I wanted to do, and I almost perfected unit 1 before moving on to unit 2. And then out of the blue, the app updated, and the lesson I was working on disappeared, and I can't personalize my lessons to suit my needs anymore. I don't think they realize it, but NOT EVERYONE LEARNS THE SAME!! I wish I could tolerate the new layout because I really loved learning Norwegian. ð"
"Hate the new ui. Stories are gone and there is absolutely no choice allowed in which lessons I start on, just a boring linear path. Terrible. Now the app is buggy as hell. Constantly freezes during speaking exercises, which totally screws you over when you're doing the special timed ""ramp up"" xp lessons that cost gems. Glad I don't pay money for this trash. Edit 11-15-22: So now they must have changed how streak freezes work. I had three equipped and missed two days in a row, and lost my streak."
"Pointless trying to learn languages with this app when it does not even have tips anymore. You just learn random words and phrases and try to figure things out as you go. What's the point when we're not given any context to what case to use when, how sentences are structured, etc.? Makes trying to learn Russian frustrating. Uninstalling this app, and won't go back to it unless they add tips back."
"I really enjoyed learning japanese on this app. Now everything has changed. Since the last update, I found real problems trying to keep up with japanese. Everytime I learn more, I forget more. It's all because they removed the legendary icons that you sometimes have to restore by practicing (which was also a really good way to gain XP). Since the new ""Path"" update came in, everything was screwed up for me. Also, the crowns were a really good way to make me keep up with my lessons."
They took an awesome app and made it very very slow to learn. Unless you already know the language you will be hard pressed to make it through a few exercises a day due to them now charging hearts to start lessons as opposed to when you get items wrong. Need to find other apps. Review is random and not very aware of areas of weakness.
"It was good, and then Duolingo forced the path update on me, not letting me choose to continue using the old skill tree UI that I was finding to work really well for me. I paid for this. I paid something like $85 for a year subscription. And now the quality, in my experience at least, has become rather poor. This is a prime example of the capitalist live service model of apps failing us. Why not let people pay for whichever version of duolingo they like or liked best?"
"Duo is now not awarding reward chests. Watch ads but don't receive the gem rewards. Happening repeatedly and with quest chests too. Money worshipping LIARS! They hate free users. Format is awful, hate the pathway. Tree was better. More confusing now. Not as easy to go back to previous lessons if rusty in an area. The stories being integrated instead of in their own tab are jarring and trouble finding my favorite ones again."
"I loved this app, & used it for 5+ years, but I don't like how much it has changed. The heart system really punishes you for mistakes, & isn't very conducive for learning. There is also a new problem w/ the visuals aswell. When I was learning Irish, the image for ""I'm a little girl"" was a full-grown man with a beard. I didnât know if it was a bug, but I came back months later & it was still there.. so I don't think it was. I don't know why they changed it, but it makes learning confusing."
"Like the old format much better. Why change to something that doesn't enhance the learning experience. I have been experiencing a lot of blank screens, freezes and slow loading since this new format's implementation. It takes forever to scroll up and down the screen with no clear indication of the subject matter. The old format was simple, clear and direct since each module will show the subject matter. Please bring back the old format and improve the technical performance of the App ðð"
"I am a long-time Duolingo user (6+ years!) and it used to be great. At the start of November though, they changed the entire user interface without warning. This eliminates all user choice, prevents progressing in the same topic-based word set repeatedly and forces you to alternate topics, so it's now unusable for self-guided learning. Because of this, I ultimately chose to leave the app and switch to Mango Languages, which I'm enjoying much more."
"Works well to learn new languages but if you care about the points and goals systems at all, prepare to be frustrated. Many, many times it doesn't count hundreds of XP I've earned or the perfect lessons I've had. It will subtract XP instead of adding it. You'll be quizzed on words like ""Sandwich"" which is the German word for Sandwich, and in the middle of a timed quiz they will decide you should know the Germans also call it ""Stulle."" Which loses your perfect streak and makes you waste time."
"4 major changes to course in 270 days. I keep losing my progress, it keeps changing the curriculum on me, it's impossible to keep track of what I learnt or to review the topics I want. I miss the Tree structure more than ever. They're making Japanese less fun and more of an annoying chore, which is a shame as I was enjoying it a lot before."
"You can apparently change your profile pic to an avatar which I was curious about, but after selecting an avatar I am not able to change it back to the previous one. Change this, you're losing personality because of this update. (Incredible useful when you start learning a new language. I've been using Duolingo for over a year now and it gave me the tools to learn the basics in a fun and intriguing way. One of the best applications in the Google store)"
"(For the Japanese course) Worse than learning a language in class. It stops being fun after a point, and when you try either writing or using speech recognition on the translation exercise, instead of the word banks, 70% of the time it will fail you even if the correct example is the same as what you wrote. It really takes away from the enjoyment and fun of learning a new language when you are punished for not going the safe route. That's why I'd rather use other Japanese language apps."
"Lately my app has been freezing. At some point it became impossible to use it. I decided to clean my phone and reinstall the app. however, all of my rewards were lost (x2 duo quest bonus, chest progress, which was 5 days in the morning and 5 days in the evening). I'm in the obsidian league right now and we're in a tough competition. I'm really upset about the lost awards as I had high hopes for them to stay in the top. I am very upset and annoyed that for the sake of this application."
"I started using this, and it was easy, fun. I didn't use it for a minute and when I came back, the entire interface had changed. I have no idea how to use it now, sucks. Keep grimy prompts that don't mean anything to með¤·ð¾ââï¸ I just Uninstalled it. It was sending notifications even though I shut them off on your site AND on my phone; somehow it was using my ear buds. At least that's what it said."
Seems like it has a solid plan. But the UI for Android is awful to the point where you can hardly use the app at all. The notifications are excessive and are impossible to turn off. Was trying to give it a shot but its just so bad. If these features were fixed it could be a great app and top contender for its format.
"Very not userfriendly, the close button sometimes is in the top left and at times it's on the top right. You can't click back while in view mode. Everything looks complicated, try to count how many buttons are there, or even shortcuts, you'll need a book to get that part. Overly advertised, and is designed to watch people strip. Admins are literally everywhere, i got kicked for doing nothing. Requires in-app purchases to even get noticed. Not worth your time."
The first couple of days were fine. I was chatting and getting to know people. I logged on. None of my features worked. I messaged the app three times. I never got a reply. A follow a few people but the app doesn't say that they are live when they are. I cannot see any of the groups that I'm in. I cannot see any of the posts in the groups. I have a photo of myself as my cover. It's just a headshot. Bigo flagged it. I went to a few panels to ask a few regulars & nobody knows why.
"Was loving this app at first. Now I can't access my points to cash out, can't see the person that signed me up and all the people I signed up can't verify my invitation number because they can't find where to put it. I can no longer message support as that feature has vanished as well. Big waste of time ð¤¬ There is no way you can contact support from app, the help section only shows a bunch of questions no way to send a message."
"Bad experience with the customer services and overall experience. I am a host and agent in bigo. Host income can receive monthly as long as i archive my target as per the å¬ä¼ t&c in bigo. However, i didn't receive my agent fees since last year dec, i am cheated by the å¬ä¼. There is a lot of scammers in the app, please be careful using this app especially when they ask money or borrow money or selling you products. I would like to share more. But it's limited to 500 words in this google review."
Worst experience I've had with an app. I went live and got banned because I look underage. I submitted THREE FORMS OF ID TO PROVE MY AGE AND WAS STILL DENIED. This app was fun up until I kept getting a run around. Which I only used it for like an hour at most. And just so we are clear I didn't even want to give 1 star but I didn't have a choice.
Stop forcing notifications on users of this app. I have notifications turned off in the app and in my phone settings but i still keep getting notifications. I will give this app 5stars if you ever fix this BS.
"New visual update as of the 22th is garbage, only images of follows and no names. You removed 2 different lists of ""live follows / friends"" (The dropdown list from explore tab and the list at the top on the community tab and replaced it with a homepage of images. Good job ð ð ð I like the app in general that's why I've spent over 30k on it but these constant visual changes are horrible."
"I can't see the option to recharge my account, Google wallet shows nothing it says error, when i try something like giving gifts it says no internet while I have it and I'm watching live."
Its changed exactly to+18 app/in the past u could see someons that they re tryingto teaching or even u could see somebodys that they re speaking about a serious subjct or musicians gamers ... now u can't even can say its changed to be a dating app and this s very big problem for this app becoz at first and dvlps tried to show the different app of bigo they said if anyone s some talents can be popular and also can earn some cashes but now only the sxy girls become popular for dating/big mistake
"Signed up as a host with car restorations being the focus of my streams. Today was banned for 24 hours while welding on a classic car IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA. They said I was away for too long but I had people actually watching the work I was doing. If you have actual talent, this app isn't for you. Camel toes and no talent is perfectly fine tho."
I have referred multiple friends and never get the referral credit for it. Worked the first few weeks but not anymore. Customer service is a joke and doesn't help you. Won't be referring anyone else to this scam app.
"For some reason my account keeps getting charged and I have just recently only bought $7 worth of something just so that I can get the opportunity to write down on here what's going on somebody has hacked into my cash app account is constantly been trying to charge $ hundred dollars to $1,400 this is why I plan on deleting this app as soon as I'm done spending all of these tokens this app is completely evil I suggest that you do the same and find a different app that does it all the same things"
"I can't see my friends list since last update, even after uninstalling and reinstalling app. Also can't play the fun games like yummy anymore. App has lost allot since last update"
Can't even use the app. Whenever I try to visit a room a message pops up that says warning: detected potential explicit content and it will not let me enter the room. It says it's for all the rooms ð¤¦ð¾ââï¸
"This app has several different disadvantages, it enters into people's privacy, it is not acceptable, and it makes the internet very popular, and it is the enemy of your mobile battery, and it spies on your personal information and sells it to companies."
So I no longer use this app I haven't given up on it completely because I did meet my husband on here and some other friends and because we use to seeing one another on this app is the only reason I still have it not my husband but my friends but all the people who has ran threw owning Bigo doesn't care about what u have to ask them or what u need help with or make any changes u have requested they only care about what money u provide and my account I had is gone they won't help get it back âð½
Dude on tt made a link to here but not their video. No way to find it and the 1st 3 videos were ppl eating. My Misophonia will not let me sift through that again to fix another algorithm.
"This app is very stupid, it didn't work for me, it said I got banned for no reason and whenever I tried to put a password on it doesn't work! I don't recommend downloading this"
Impossible to stop notifications from this app. I turned them off within the app itself...still kept getting notifications. I then turned the notifications off via my phone so it wasn't even allowed to give me notifications....stilll kept going off at all hours of the day and night. Deleting from my phone is the only guaranteed way of not getting bombarded with bigo notifications. *UPDATE* you know your suggestion doesn't work. You're predators allowing underage girls to stream on here.
I do recommend this at all as soon as you installe it your account gets hacked and get access to your social media this is the worst app on play store just because of this app i lost my account and everything else please do not install this if you don't want get hacked
"Bad experience after a long time i again install BIGO but never saw international Hosts, bigo creative team every time when i feed back respond that we are working on it and soon we start international viewing to your country but still Not functioning I'm really disappointed â¹ï¸"
I had this app before on my iPhone reinstalled it on my tablet then tried to reinstall it back onto my iPhone and itâs saying not supported in my country ð³ I just had it on my phone and still on the tablet how is it not supported in my country??this is not only weird but stupid I just donât get it this app really deserves less than one starð¤¦ð½ââï¸
"With lot of bug lately its been annoying. Trying to use the app but i keep on getting the message"" Network unavailable please check "" in the display and preventing to use the app. Please fix this. Despite using a good speed of wifi it is still showing the same message."
I am update my app time to time ok. Now my bigo app carry 2 gb data. But when I am install this app and now this time I am updating fully no one nothing changes in my app. No earnings and no views in my videos.
"Very bad, the administrator does not realize that here they only scam people and many things have to be changed. I would give it 10 stars if it existed"
"The app is ok. The issue here is that Bigo take More than 60 percent of earnings from the broadcaster. There really should be a legal scrub when it comes to the terms and conditions and how each broadcaster should be earning. It's a shame,but I will have to leave this app as it no longer is needed in my life. Do not spend all your money sending people gifts because if u pay 100 dollars worth of gifts,they only see about 25 dollars. Might as well get their info and send them money as a transfer."
"Using the app gets you mad sometimes in the fact that when you're chatting normally with a broadcaster, an admin can just kick you out when ever they want, which is not good at all without any proper reason or getting permission from the broadcaster and when reported, we get only messages without any actions done to prevent innocent people from being falsely kicked out when chatting with a broadcaster. Hope something is done about this, and this will go a long way to promote peace."
Can't do anything on this app without it being a problem especially if you are a host. Can't do a multi guest with your camera off. Can't do an audio live and mute yourself for a few. Uninstalling and finding a better live streaming app cause this one ain't it. ðð
Very expensive app.with a Very low rate of winning and giving false hope to men. All it cares is to gain money. Doesn't even care to host and spenders..
"So confusing!!!! Nudity, and sex for sale!!! This app pretty much is sexual oriented!! You have to ""show off"" your body just on your own profile!!!"
Terrible experience. App keeps sending notifications when I have blocked and forced stopped. Uninstalling app.
I like this app but hundred or thoudsands bad liveð¡ð¡ð¡.Please stop them to bad liveð¡ð¡ð¡.

"I was going to post my message to public just now, suddenly it says have sensitive words!! Not a single sensitive word! Now I can't post my message to public again!! Please fix it!!"
An alert comes up over and over again over the top of the screen I've complained to them a number of times with no response or fixing the problem
I find it uneventful I think it's an empty money pit where wait and look for how to pay out instead of enjoying the woman's performance.
Very poor Support team..I send emails they come back stating can not be found as I sent off thier links..I been trying to get help with getting Into my account witch I have invested alot of money in this app you would think I'd get help still have not.i will be speaking with lawyers tomarrow
"Be careful, this app is using your microphone without your permission despite even first time downloading and opening."
Stop running your awful fullscreen ads on grindr where you have an insanely tiny close button that tricks me into opening this store page over and over
"Bigo lite is bad experience. I need to uninstall. I can't find the full beta app. Admin, please send me."
All features are not available for all devices. The background and the virtual host feature hasn't worked for me since it was released. My operating system and BIGO app is up to date.
"The best way to fix ,,, connection lost , reconnecting ,, is by make a biggest server for this program .. the more money you spend the more money you will get"
It's a good app and their is si many interesting things that you may like and it really helps me to build up
Lucky 21 used to be my favorite. But it is no longer provably Fair. It's rigged and designed to make the player lose constantly.
Too many bots. Tons of profiles with the same words just different pictures.
"Horrible hacking of all phones immei""die""tly after you stream and exploit will bluetooth ota zero day on ur device say goodbye to your phone. Gross."
Very buggy app too many bots too hard to filter out the people you don't want to associate with. And far too hard to block and remove the creeps. Worst app of this kind so far. Reply to developer: I was not band or complaining about any of what you have mentioned. My complaint is about the entire app functionality as a whole. In addition I had tried the poorly designed help system offered by the app and found this section to be one of the reasons for my 1* rating. App needs a total rebuild
Good app I have more friends now but please do not allow to visit any live without log in there is so many people without log in use then take screenshot and video recording. Solve this issue. Without log in do not allow to go any live stream. Also one of my friend picture someone abuse not good picture.. many times I send feedback but not remove the picture. But if I put profile my profile is ban what is this rules.. ð.
"Too many scammers here, lacks star and review for broadcasters to stop scammers, gifts are too expensive, banning system is too complicated, broadcast rewards is too little compare to time spent, app tries to capture your private info, and more... Answer to Bigo comment: I have already used feed back, no answer, it seems you use Robots."
Two faced app that let's everyone else show suggestive behavior but me when I show alittle bit of cleavage and I get removed this is so Hypocritical do not download ..
"Ai win more games and it is ridiculous. The rate of winning is low almost less than 3% and the game gets more wins. Related to the buying items, the rate of win is so low. I use more diamonds than winning rate.There should be a balance. Bigo makes money through broadcasters not them. They need to increase the earning for them or many BJ will leave this app. Balance isnt great in this app. I dont understand also why exchange rate for diamond to cash is lower than buying diamond."
"This app causes disharmony on any device it is installed on. Harmony is restored the moment this app is uninstalled. Similar to that of any other social media app that is being used for nefarious purposes by clandestine organisations. ""Join our 400 million users world wide... So we can put the same criminal cultists in your suggested connections every day"". The same thing occurs on all apps that connect to more than one user. No point in trying since the crims won't let real connectivity occur."
Just stop hijacking notifications. Already disabled both in-app notifications and through Android settings but the app is still showing notifications through media control like if the app is Spotify. Just sucks.
after update the bigo have many bugs!cannot reconect if u out from bigo 10seconds
"They call police and child services etc. On broadcasters, they will find your social and address and leak it. They will spread false rumors about you Once you become a host. It's a nightmare and not worth it. Just beware. This app is sick. That's why no celebrities don't come back on the app or even normal people don't come back but if you stay on be ready for the raft of hell."
"No one on this app is real, everyone is just using each other for points. This isn't about getting a relationship this is just about using people. What a trash app full of thirsty people that don't even know where they're going in life. Or they're already happy and they're just using everyone else on this app.. Bunch of snakes. *Recap* You sent me a bogus email. You should figure out what is important boss man."
I've been trying to buy diamond..I got debited three times...I can't see any diamond... please refund my money back
"This app is good, but I only have one bad experience there's this one spectator who send me gifts but I did not received the gifts."
What is going on with this app now when i log in its will say no live now ð³ what does that mean its takes all the fun away..i live in usa is there any restrictions on certain regions to use this application?
"Used to be fun until stupid restrictions for no reason , tech support is full of ... Bugs n error reports go same road .. answer to reply : no I don't get ban because there is no message said I got ban unless u guys like to do something and not tell user"
"Rubbish, full of bots, constant notifications despite me turning them off"
This app is lame I shall stay with Facebook ...all need to do better r shut this shty down a waste of time and money ..... block me out I can careless this app is not worth using by no means I've been on better all dum Facebook has better scores than this all can use some pointers from them on me
I have been using Bigo for couple of days so far its nice good plarform to meet and chat to people i will continue while i learn more about app.
The new updaye is horrible. Glitchy laggy won't load the lives just keeps buffering. And they only ban and report black peoples pages on there. Every other race and every other country can do whatever they want but not black Americans.
"Great app used by Mexican Cartels, ISIS, other terrorism groups and now Russia. Discord never cared when ISIS, or Mexican Cartels used it for human trafficking, but now they finally drew the line when Russia started using it. Hilarious!!! It's been going on for years! But now it's not okay."
"Its an amazing app, and i want to give it 5 star. But i have a question if you people please help me out find the reason. Actually in my bigo live app, i don't have makeup filter like other use. What is the reason??? I have oppoA57. Please help me out"
Every time I try and open the app it just closes. Which hasn't done before so I don't know what's going on.
This app is good but the only problem is you have no time to having fun with your host there is no kids there like tik tok why always banned host i hate it soo much.thats why i give it one star
This app is very good but it needs to be used like pron app. Bigo needs to be made for adult and anyone can show anything
Could be a good app but when the block you non stop..the cut your streams and block sor pornagraphic video while a 47 year old trying to cling on to some shape..don't install bigo they block u if they are told to even if you really on ur earning ill nor be clack on ur app and I'm taking u to court
after update the audio room was not roundded again..to big if minimize..

"Forces notifications even though they are blocked, also bombards you with them at all hours of the night with an exceptionally loud notification tone. Besides, it has absolutely nothing unique about it and is honestly just a waste of time and storage"

"This app is an absolute pain. Upon the second I installed it, my phone started lagging and the app was lagging too. It kept spamming me with different things to do, I didn't even have the chance to go check on any lives because I was forced to enter my phone number multiple times. Other than that, their ads use videos from other social media platforms that have absolutely nothing to do with this app. False advertising at its finest. Unfortunately, I have to give one star."
"SUPPORT I'm not emailing again, do your job, & stop using auto response messages for reports! Puts me in Spanish region, they use cell location instead of asking your nationality/language. Support didn't respond to any of my requests. I also reported a few fake accts, 1 fake Selena Gomez, and I get auto responses saying they found nothing wrong. They are aiding frauds gain gifts/$ by ignoring all reports. But they ban your broadcasts for ""sharing personal details"" and it wasn't payment info."

I was hired to be an official broadcaster for this lousy company but they put me under a ten year suspension for a video that's still in circulation on their platform, over a 1 second clip of hemp gummies, while they allow the women to post fetish videos, but still insist I do live broadcast for them? Never ever join this Platform! Especially if you don't broadcast fetish videos!"
"A very good place to meet new people and make friends. But also beware of scammers too, and also the app consumes alot of data. But all in all, I enjoy the app. Thank you developers."
"APP ARE FULL OF SCAM ARTISTS PRETENDING TO BE OTHER PEOPLE, Also bigo does nothing to them , the feedback doesn't work even when I use a working Email... you can only follow a small amount of people daily, the stream also keeps stopping... and if you are a man you can't be without a t-shirt, but all the ladies are half naked on the app...and today the app doesn't want to load"
"I've disabled all alerts within the app and disabled notifications in my Android phone settings yet I still receive alerts on my phone Taskbar. Will wait for Developers reply to my review before I uninstall app. Update: I see other people are reporting same issue over a year ago, UNINSTALLED APP."
Recent update has shown some improvement. finally splitting private messages from official message. but why am i still getting notifications when i have already turned them off? if this is not resolved i have no choice but to uninstall the app and leave bigo for good
"I did like this app until I was unjustly discriminated against by Bigo official. Was banned for a year over nothing after just paying several times for diamonds. There's no way to appeal and I lost my main account and all the levels I've gained, plus tools, friends etc. This app is a waste of time. Too many fake accounts and no customer appreciation."
Im just giving only 1 star because of their activities is not good performance.. when you r higher bet .. you will win but wen you be a greedy on betting the bigo will lose you.. till you will be recharge again.. im so dissapointed.. i had no problem with the encounter the other people.. but sometimes is annoying and sometimes when you r betting on higher you wll be continueslly lossing until you recharge again..
"Sigh. This app has so much potential. But silly things implemented by developers mean the app is basically a ghost town. In any Live, the 'viewer count' is inflated so much, there is only about 5% of the count is actual viewers at any time. Also, the greed from the beans means viewers don't like donating much, as the host only receives about 25% of the donated amount. If you buy $100 of beans and donate to a host, the host only gets about $25."
"App is bypassing notification block. Samsung S21 Ultra Android 13. Reply to developer: know how to turn off notifications ... Fix your app. Uninstall/reinstall does not help..Notifications disabled in App settings and disabled in Android OS, still get Live messages..."

My card was charged multiple times without my consent and I have not been able to get a refund or get into contact with anyone from customer service. Terrible app.
It just a site to buy nudes and half that is fake. The games are made to only take the dimonds used to play them with no real payouts. You take money from the hist if they make to much taking all their hard work for this i uninstalled and mkst likely will never reinstall the app.
Installed this app just because i want to review it. The ads on this app is genuinely really disgusting. My 4 year old daughter keeps having ads from this app and it's disgusting. I would like the disgusting ads be removed.
Bigo is good to be on but it's stay lagging and disconnecting alot. I'm starting to not want to be on the app bc it glitch way too much. I can't even enjoy my favorite broadcasters
Please read **I already turn off the invasive notifications on my phone** but it annoyingly still pop up. Sorry is not an exception please fix it...
The suggested videos under the popular tab contains so much nudity. I don't like it
The new update is terrible. You can't see who is online. I mean the circle pictures of your friends. How do you see who is live. Please update the app back to the normal app. Please ð«

"It was recently intrusive when I was working online and I hadn't even used or installed the app. It interrupted my online shopping about every 15-20 minutes. As it turns out, it's purely younger people chatting. I have no idea why they chose me to annoy but it worked. I couldn't uninstall it fast enough."
"Too many times I've disabled notifications for them to just pop up again. Also where it states on your site for the stream information for OBS, if it's not available for everyone, don't have the option to go there. I'd still be fine with testing the application via desktop, but not on this app"

"Not beginner friendly! This app is so confusing to me. Everyone recommends it but I cannot figure it out for the life of me. To be honest I'm not savvy with tec stuff. In order for me to want to pay for more features, I would first have to see the value, which I am struggling with.... Please make this app more user-friendly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The minute I open canva up I am overwhelmed. I would absolutely love to be able to use it for beautiful professional content that is easy to achieve!"
"I'm deleting. Basically worthless. Any useful features are paid. Update: Responding to Canva. Yes, I understand that you have to pay to use the good features or pay for a subscription; however, the lack of good tools available for free use to try, dissuades me from making either choice. Seems like a shortsighted marketing strategy."
"This app used to be fantastic. Now, it's impossible to use text boxes. The cursor jumps around to random spots while you're typing, paragraphs suddenly have massive spaces between them, and text boxes become horrendously long without you doing anything to it. It's so bad, I thought someone had hacked into my account and was editing from another device."
"Been using this app for years for my businesses! Loved the templates and it was super easy to use to make content. For two weeks, I've been trying to update my menu for the new year and having the text box issue everyone is having. I have uninstalled, tried it on my tablet, my computer and went to canva.me/android. Nothing has helped & it deleted my menu. Since I'm starting from scratch, I'm thinking about looking for a new app. I hope this can be resolved in the near future"
"Used to be great, text boxes keep changing while editing. Makes it impossible to edit. Very frustrating! Don't purchase the pro version, you can't use it properly. UPDATE: The app creators replied telling me to close all unused apps and try again, and if that doesn't work, reply with a screenshot to a link that doesn't work! HA. WHAT A JOKE. A screenshot will do no justice anyway. I'd have to send a video to show how the text box increases with every letter I type, moves the cursor around, etc.!"
"The text boxes will not let me manipulate that text. It will allow me to remove unnecessary spaces between lines but as soon as I try and move the text box itself it will put the spaces back. There is also the fact that the app slows to the point of freezing while I am trying to type in the text box. I have used Canva on a desktop browser and it has worked very nicely so I thought, looking at the ratings, that the phone app would work nicely as well, turns out I was wrong."
"As more features are being added, the app tends to be slow, tedious and constantly crashing. Having the ""pro"" feature means nothing. You just pay a lot for a low quality image that is not compatible with anything. Images comes out pixeled to the point that it's not worth it. Disappointed ð Gonna take my $119 and spend it on a app that's worth the money."
"Links in emails try to open in the app, however, the app doesn't know what to do with it, so it just loads and loads and loads and... does nothing. Edit: I've done all the troubleshooting already. It's not me. There's not much left I can do. Specifically, it seems to be video links, if that matters. Using the link in a browser loads the page, but opening it within the app (which is default Android behavior when tapping the link in an email) does the above infinite loading."
"Recently I have had trouble editing and it is so frustrating! I do most of my creating and editing on the go on my galaxy s22 ultra. When I edit text it will keep adding returns, extending the text box. When I delete the returns and bring the text and box where it needs to be, it adds it back in again. After several attempts to correct this the app locks up. Is almost like it just wants to F with me and when I am finally winning it throws a tantrum. I don't need this in my life."
"We used to love the app and would give 5 stars.We've closed out of everything and reset things multiple times and still have the exact same issue. It turns a 30-minute project into well over a few hours, and this is no exaggeration.It's a painstaking task to currently edit any text through the app. The text box extends past the area you're working on, and it won't allow you to see the text when you try to edit. The delete button and the button to duplicate things are no longer working as well."
"Completely unusable now. When I click on text boxes, they start to add extra lines and re size on their own. Makes the whole app go nuts, freeze and quit out. Sometimes losing quite a bit of my 'saved' design. I'm aware this is a known bug for Android users. I can't justify spending money on an app I can't use anymore. Sorry Canva, the ride good, when it was good."
"Where's the draw/pencil feature!!!? What happened to it!!?? This used to be soo much better. Can't work on it for 10 minutes without having to restart and refresh. Too many issues not only with the app but with the website as well. Can't believe I'm putting my money into it. Please fix the issues people keep telling you about,we all experiencing them and still no resolutions."
"It is not user friendly on android. Editing text in previous works is impossible. It has been a few months since I last used it, I never had an issue before. Very disappointing since it auto saved my work and now even my original graphic is ruined. I tried changing keyboard settings as suggested in previous reviews with no luck. The response time is very slow causing mistakes also. I hope this gets resolved quickly. It appears this has been an issue for others for quite some time now."
Clearly everyone can't be complaining about the same text editing problems without you guys realizing it has something to do with the app at this point. This was a great app until whatever update you guys did to make the app start glitching out with the text editing. Just lost a fan because I cannot create or edit my projects anymore. Will check back in a month or so to see if any changes have been made and yes I did everything you requested to try and it hasn't resolved the problem.
There is a ongoing text issue here that I am experiencing and as reported by others. When you add text it keeps enlarging the text box as if a user pressed the space button 50 times. Keep back spacing to bring it back and it keeps expanding the text box vertically. It makes it 10X bigger than the actual photo. Anytime you try to fix it keeps expanding. Totally ruins any quote bubbles you have in your photo
"AS with most companies these days they'll invent the problem to sell you the solution, except pro status doesn't save you from bugs. Text boxes are funking so editing is impossible. Also the new photo editor(was it necessary?) + problems with aligning text/boxes etc. This is an app that is trying to cram so much into it as if it were desktop software. Adding so many features is making the UI and usability in general anything but user friendly. Every update it's slower with more bugs sadly..."
"Canva was working perfectly fine in 2020-2022. But for some reason, I'm paying for an app monthly that is no longer working properly. Every time I go in to create a flyer, poster, etc it is taking me more than an hour because it would not allow me to edit. It moves each time I put my cursor in the box. It's frustrating and I am now starting to search for other avenues. Please fix this bug."
"I agree w/ Brenna Moss pertaining to the text boxes. I have tried exiting and re-entering the app several times, with no avail. I find myself not completing projects at all because it is becoming too time consuming to try to delete the extra space within the text box that the app magically created on its own. Update: Contacted the developer, & received automation saying they don't check that inbox. So I requested refunds for Dec & Jan, pausing my subscription till the problem is solved."
"I love canva and have been using it for years. But the mobile app absolutely sucks. Need to type anything more than a line of text into your design? Good luck. It will freak out and crash the app. It locks my designs and crashes constantly. There is no way to really contact customer service when you're on a dealine, which is frustrating."
"The text boxes are now useless due to a glitch, which causes extra lines and spaces to appear rapidly while trying to type in the box. I have the pro version , and I have tried the work around they suggest in the help center, to no avail. This has rendered the entire app useless to me. Update: Canva responded with workarounds that I have already tried, as indicated in my initial review. They also posted a non-working link for me to further report my issue. Not helpful."
Great until it stopped working on my phone (Note 10+) and tablet ( S7+) I had used Canva for years with no issues at all. But now no matter if I'm on the app or browser it all freezes and the text boxes keep expanding if I'm hitting enter all the time and they will not let me type. I can't even now do my work. From a 10/10 it went to a 1/10
"I like Canva, but the mobile app is worthless & has been for a while. It seems like many others have the same issue with the text boxes as I do when using the app on mobile devices. Every time I add a text box & start typing, it will automatically expand on its own, almost impossible to edit, & needs to be restarted or it'll restart itself. Simple things are hard to do until you use the web browser instead of the mobile app. I pay for the PRO & I can't even use the mobile app, which is unusable."
"Absolutely horrible now! This used to be my favorite app, but for the past couple months I literally can't save anything without it being corrupted. Not only that, but when I go in to make edits on Old projects, its removing all of my transitions!!! I'm not even sure how that's possible, but my patience is spent. I have updated, troubleshot, and done everything I know to do... I give up"
"The features are great. However, I ordered something and I double checked on my end to make sure everything was fine. When I received my order, there was an error. I went t back in to make sure it wasn't done on my part before contacting support about the issue. I was met with ""Please make sure you didn't blah blah blah."" It was very passive aggressive and they seemed unwilling to actually fix the mistake made on their end. Response to Canva: No thanks. I went with Vista Print"
"I enjoy using Canva on the computer and have tried multiple times to use the app on my phone for quick edits and each time it never functions the way it should. You cannot move objects easily or add text, change text, or move it around. Not user friendly. Update: Dear Lily, you missed the point. I'm not in need of a guide or video on how to navigate adding text. The point is that the app isn't user friendly. No amount of education is going to fix a poorly created app. Regards - Kristie"
"I used the free version, and I can't add text. When I try to edit the text, the box becomes automatically bigger to the point where I can't scroll up to see what I'm editing anymore and any attempts to fix it just makes the box bigger. The text won't stay in the same spot either because of this. I have this issue with the mobile app, but the website doesn't seem to have this problem."
"This App has become a total disaster and nightmare. The processed result looks NOTHING like what it does while your editing. It has become riddled with glitches (at least on my Android). I tried updating, uninstalling and reinstalling, nothing works. In the beginning it worked great. The longer I had it the more bugs and glitches I had to work around. Unbelievable."
"I was excited to design a business card for our new venture. I had to keep re-doing it because the design or text would teleport off-center, which the back button wouldn't fix. Then the actual image was right, but the thumbnail was screwed up. And that is what prints and saves. Great. After all that, I go to submit the design to be printed on our cards. AND IT'S BLURRY AS HELL. But you can pay $13 to make it actually usable. Sure would have been nice to know before I wasted my time!!!"
Updated version is buggy slow and unusable. I used to use this app daily. It was fast and very user friendly. Never any glitches that frustrated me. Now it's all frustrating. My photos won't load in the gallery view consistently. The interface isn't at all intuitive and the design previews are not correct. It's pretty much unusable since the update. Please offer previous version again.
"Update Ruined the App. Don't try to fix what isnt broken. I've been using this app for years for our business. The recent update has ruined the app. All the fonts are overlapping on templates. It crashes constantly. The formats for text show up as a white box, so you can't change font type, color or size. I've switched to PicsArt which is nowhere as good as Canva USED to be. But this app is now unusable. Ive tried uninstall/install. Nothing works."
"Having a lot of difficulties using/managing the app. When I put a picture in as a background, the app claimed the photo was there, but I couldn't see it and when I printed it, the picture didn't show up either. I tried moving the page again and removing and then putting back the photo, but nothing worked. I love the website on a computer or laptop, but, again, having trouble with the app."
"Up until the recent update I loved this app and would have given it 5+ stars if possible. I was even considering a paid subscription to access all the amazing fonts and graphics. Now I don't even want to use it. From the list menu for project size, to changing a background, to adding text and having it freeze if you need to resize...it's a nightmare. Not user friendly at all. Please consider returning to the old user-friendly format."
"This app used to be my absolute favorite, now it's a horrible experience. The user interface is no longer easy to use and takes way more work to create than before. And when trying to download my content I created it never saves the same as it looks in the app, so text has moved and overlaps and looks horrible, moving it and resizing is a guessing game and you have to make multiple edits to get it to save even remotely close. Completely useless to me now. I will have to go find another app."
Loved this app until it updated. It is less user friendly for many reasons. Previously when picking a canvas I could see a visual and now only the dimensions. Another thing is when adding items such as stickers the options now completely block the project you are working on. I want to be able to see my options to add and see what I already have. The simplicity that made me love the app is no more. I am frustrated and disappointed with the update.
"I've been using Canva Pro for months now and it has been fine up until the last week or so. Now it's to the point of almost unusable which is unacceptable for something I'm paying for. Like many others have said, the problem is with editing text. When I try to edit text the entire app glitches causing random zooming and random slide changes mid edit. It makes designing for my business nearly impossible. This needs to be fixed immediately because like I said...I'm paying for this, to not work!"
"Lovely app! The only major issue I have is that the fonts can be hard to read, despite what color I choose. Maybe adding an option which allows us to add colored strokes (I believe that's what they're called) to the text? That would easily make this a 5 star app!! Edit: Horrible that you require users to give you CAMERA permissions to use their gallery!! Definitely uninstalling, especially since versions that don't require that aren't supported anymore."
"What has happened to my simple easy app? Its so difficult to swap photos for customization, they get flipped around or put to the front then resize it- No because it just doesnt cooperate! The platform before was simple, easy& quick. Now I feel like I have to watch a video... I will not keep paying for something that takes a while to customize. OMG, and scrolling to look at templates! SMH, all the sudden as you scroll it pulls some random template up. Presumably it's ""touchy"" or my thumb got fat"
"Used to love it. The update this week is infuriating. Editing text on mobile is ridiculously difficult. Fonts I want don't exist (Georgia? Garamond?), or I have to scroll past a couple alphabetized lists to find it (Montserrat). I can't add bullet points without adding them to the entire text box. Even moving text around is difficult. Going to look for a different app. Microsoft Paint is more user friendly than this"
"I'm a premium user & pay for an account. I use both the desktop version and the app on my phone on a daily basis. Since the update the app is HORRIBLE. If I create something on the computer and then try to open it in the app on my phone, all of the dimensions and sizing of writing has changed. It no longer fits on the page & everything overlaps each other. It's useless, and extremely frustrating that the two applications obviously do not interface well with each other. 2/20/21 it's still a mess."
"This app is great! I really enjoy using it to create professionally designed documents, collages, flyers and more. Its user-friendly and super clear to use. It also has a huge variety of ready made designs that can easily be personalized. Lately, though, the mobile app is really not working well. It takes a while to load, takes a very long time to download my project on my phone, as well as when I try editing or changing things on my project. Can you please fix it?"
"The program has its benefits, although is severely lacking when compared to other similarly priced options. However, the real issue is that there is a serious error with the program, causing ALL saved projects to be significantly altered. Text, images, and every other aspect, shift randomly when saved. Meaning what ever you've designed is ruined as soon as you try to export it (in any format). This renders the program useless and required me to start all over with another program."
"What you see is NOT what you get. I use the app from my phone to stay up on my social media accounts. When I create a post I expect it to look like I create it but it does not. When I attempt to share, the text has moved or overlapping. The pixel quality is bad. it's getting frustrating. When this happens I have to go back to the photo to adjust and try again to post. Sometimes it takes 2 or 3 times to adjust to get it to look correct."
Edit: Very glitchy since the most recent update. The duplicate and delete functions on elements are not working so I have to drag elements off of the design to get rid of them. I tried deleting and reinstalling the app and it seems to be a bug that needs corrected. Plenty of templates and graphics to work with and easy to use! There's a few quirks and glitches that need to be fixed but overall it's the best app for the job!
"Canva sucks! People say it's so great, but it's tricky, annoying and time consuming to figure out the functions and then they don't even look good anyways! Borders around images and text are easy in other apps, in Canva they're cumbersome, clumsy and look awful! It's very hard to use, the results are poor and it's impossible to get it to do exactly what you want, the free version is so bad I can't imagine why anyone would ever pay them for this useless irritating headache of a piece of software!"
"UPDATE.... CANVA has recently really gone from good to horrible in customer support. I believe they do not look at the emails but a computer responds based on keywords. CANVA lacks a few things that drive me crazy..... a color picker wand so you can select from a spot on your page and a favorite button to put photos, illustrations, graphics, fonts in a folder so you do not lose them forever with the zillions of images they offer! Love the program but it does frustrate me in those two ways."
"I use canva on my desktop all the time and love it! But the canva app is not great. It doesn't let you edit almost anything, especially if it's from the version available on the desktop. You don't have access to your colors and it's very limited in what you can actually do. It's probably the worst app for an online program I've ever seen or used in my life. I will be uninstalling it since I have to use it on my chrome browser with the desktop option on anyway. Don't get this app!"
Update ruined it. Gotta find new app now Edit: You pasted the PC user interface and removed the super easy to use mobile interface. It was so easy to use that I would use my phone instead of my pc to do all my editing... you took the best interface out of every service available and made it impossible to use. I can't even change layers the thing is so glitchy. Go back to the way you had it before or ill never use your app again
"This app is trash. Their guidelines wont allow you to line up some elements properly, & 99% of the time, all formating is lost when you save to device. It looks fine on the app screen but the actual saved result is mashed together & unreadable. I have tried it on different phones & it's always the same. This has been an ongoing problem since I first discovered the app a year ago. I will download it to see if it's fixed & it never is. Don't waste your time & save yourself from frustration."
"What is going on???? Been using Canva for a year & loved it. But since the first of this year it is TERRIBLE! Adding text, it all of a sudden will add in so many empty lines that I can't even find the bottom. Also randomly totally locks up & I have to close. When I open back up, what I was working on is missing half the elements. I've deleted & reloaded multiple times with no improvement. Please fix this!"
"I am currently trialing pro, but all the features aren't there. Effects are missing, particularly wanting it for the background eraser. I've checked to see that it shows pro trail, which it does. Does the app have different options for iPhone vs Android? I love the desktop version, but will not pay for pro if all the same options are not available through the app. Thanks!"
"This graphic arts layout app looked promising. But after a trying to make my own full page flyer from scratch, I was only able to place a couple of images when it kept saying ""this document deleted by owner and is no longer accessible."" This was frustrating, to say the least. One star for poorly implemented app. ð"
"I've tried to save my design via the app and it simply will not save. I have a stable internet connection and the latest version of the app. So frustrating because I've spent hours over the past few days re-doing this same design and IT WILL NOT SAVE!!! It even recognizes the images I've been using in the ""uploaded media"" but none of it appears on my presentation. Would love for this bug to be fixed, willing to change my review if it does get fixed."
"I spent so much time creating a video and timing certain segments to line up with the music only for it to be unplayable in the Canva app when shared to the recipient via email link. Even after downloading my video as an MP4, the audio somehow is sped up and the video is lengthened by several seconds to a full minute. What a waste of time and energy! That said, I don't understand why anyone would pay to use this app."
"The app use to be my fav but now I don't know what happened to it. It keeps on reloading even though I have a stable internet connection the worst thing is it would take almost 10 reloads before I could open something I want to edit. It also take a lot of time before I could download the video or picture I edited like it would take almost an hour. One more thing, when I would duplicate or delete something I have to tap on it for like 5 times before it duplicate or delete."
"This app has wonderful free editing features that I use for digital assignments, but I've recently become disappointed with the frustrating experience of using it. The app glitches incessantly as I use it by making the text boxes really long and freezing the screen, forcing me to have to leave the app and rejoin just for it to happen again. If this problem isn't fixed soon, I will definitely be deleting this app. I never review apps, but this is truly disappointing."
"I used to like this app a lot but recently it has become so painfully slow. I used to like it coz it is pretty simple to use and very user-friendly, you can finish a project in just a few mins than when you use adobe and etc. But now I feel like I am spending way more time doing a single simple project coz of the slowness. It completely defeats the purpose of using a simple app with limited editing tools."
"I'm having problems tapping the trash icon to remove an element. It just blinks and doesn't respond. I can do everything else with it like moving it and adjusting it's size. But I can remove an element that has been added. Browser version is great. Worth the Pro account. But the app (Android) is unusable. Such a shame, since I could really use this for working on the go. 1 star until it's fixed or someone helps me resolve this issue."
"I remember when I first used this app. It used to be good but after those updates, it keeps getting worse and worse. It's laggy as hell, with literally everything loading for at least 5 minutes before you could even start doing anything despite a good internet connection which is so annoying. I can't even finish anything even after loading a template as it would literally take forever for the app to respond or load majority of the content. -1 out of 5."
"This app is very beautiful but stupid at the same time. I made a monthly subscription. I was charged recently on the 14th of April. I logged into the app, and it needed an update. As I updated it, my subscription is nowhere. It says I should paste my invoice reference, or check my subscription history, but nothing exist after the update."
"I used to like this app. With its great qualities and all but it has become annoying and frustrating to use. It takes so long to load when I literally have stable connection, it keeps on reloading. Now the updates, it's getting worse and worse."
I can't use the templates. Everytime I try to use one ot tells me that it can't load because of slow internet even though the internet connection is completely fine. At times the app just randomly freezes and won't work until I exit then open it again.
I wasted 3 days and 3 month money on Pro Subscription just to upload a video to edit. It keeps failing upload no matter what I did. Video reduce to less than 1 GB it won't work. So I broke down the same video to 14 100mbs videos and tried still upload starts but fail every 10 sec. Honestly this app has made my work more extensive. Day 4 and my videos are still failing during upload despite pressing retry a 100 times. Waste of time and money honestly. Worst there is no Live Technical Support.
"The app is good, but the performance is not. It's freaking disgusting. While I was downloading my edits, the app kept popping up and said to check my internet connection. What? My internet connection is stable. The problem is in the app. Hey developer, can you fix the problem? It's freaking bad."
Update 4/30/23 I decided to give another try. The welcome page says to sign up or if you have an existing account they'll log you in. I try to sign in using Google but it keeps saying there's already an account associated with my email. DUH I'm trying to login! Original: I just downloaded the app after signing up for a pro account. It won't allow me to sign in to the app with my existing account and so I can not access any of my brand materials or pro features. What good is that??
"I love the templates and elements but I don't like that it takes a long time to load, to save my works and now I'm trying to save my works with 11 pages and it always failed!! Aagghh!! I know this isn't my device or network fault. It's your application! Fix it!!"
"Doesn't work for Android. Can't use the basics without subscription. I paid the subscription to no avail. The background remover a basic tool, did not work without serious glitches. Could not move or zoom the pic to edit it in the T-shirt app while using the zoom or even to adjust the position of the image. By the time I finally got the pic to where I could use the background remover the Magic remover icons in the toolbar blocked the bottom of the image. Subscription canceled and app deleted!"
"I enjoy everytime I edit in this app. However, despite my strong WiFi connection, I can't get through the loading screen lately. Or if I can get through, templates, my past works, and even elements won't load anymore. It's getting inconvenient. Please fix this, app's too good for it to be just a loading screen."
The app is so annoying my internet is good but the presentation that i want to create is always loading I'm so tire at school and this app make it worst. It gives me more stress. Everytime I landscape my phone it won't automatically go to landscape mode in playing the presentation pls fix it it giving so much headache.
"Unless I use it on my laptop this app is just horrible on mobile devices, hideous!!! It crashes all the time and doesn't allow you to even change the font. I thought I could rely on this while not having my pc, but it is a bad joke."
"The audio trimming doesn't work, since the last update I can't trim the audio in my graphics. This is one of those moments of breaking something that wasn't broken. So frustrating."
"The problem with this app is that everytime I open it, it always take a lot of time to reload. Maybe put some optimizations to your app so that it would be convenient especially for those editors in a hurry. The long reload issue occurs on both PC and Mobile version of this app."
"So apparently I already have an account. When try to reset the password or request a link, it like keeps resetting the link over and over so that by the time I am inputting/resetting it it's not letting me. It's just an endless game of reset tag. I can't even give a proper review because I can't get in my account."
Worst ever service support. They are providing unlimited space on Google drive with app. I bought paid subscription just because of space requirement but all my data lost. Don't buy paid subscription. Fraud people fraud app .... I have to select one star because I don't have any option to give zero star rating to this..
I used to find this app super helpful but lately I can't work on a single thing. It has become super frustrating and impossible to work with. Every time I try adding text or editing projects it adds hundreds of lines and freezes so that I can't even use the app.
"Didn't get to the app, just like the photoshop and light room editing apps. You have to start/open an account or login with facebook or your Google account just to see what the app has to offer...why? That's a 100% sign that you're more interested in my info/content than you are in designing an app that makes me interested in your info and content. Just as with any other app that needs me to setup an account before I test the app- I just immediately Uninstall and keep searching"
"I tried the premium version and it is flat out the worse app. Glitching, running slow, freezing and just frustrating. It does not do what it is suppose to do. I have unsubcribed, uninstalled and if you haven't by now please do or if you are thinking of using this app don't bother. It's useless."
Massive Issue with Text Boxes. Everytime you try to edit a text box it keeps adding lines to it making it impossible to do any work. It also does this online when using a tablet/phone but not from a PC. Very disappointing that this clearly has been an issue for a while a still not being sorted!
"It's a good apk to make projects yet when I'm trying to make or edit files, it takes too long to load and also gives me an advice to reconnect to my internet but I'm already connected to it and my internet's speed is fast yet this apk still loads too slow to proccess my data in it."
"Pathetic if you are using free version. Nothing is useful anymore. Earlier we used to get decent choices but now everything is paid. Even there is no search filter for free and paid, have to scroll through all the catalogues and if we like something it's paid. Paid version is also expensive."
"Some of the features on the mobile app are no longer available such as transitioning in the mobile video pages, increasing timing of mobile video pages. Very frustrating It is now doing return until text box is too long to find text. Happens on app and desktop. Has been doing this for a week now"
"Extremely disappointed to see Canva joining the AI use. The amount of trouble AI has caused for artists and writers is horrible, and seeing yet another app adding to that sucks. I had used Canva regularly for my shop announcements and other needs, but I don't think I'll be using it any longer."
"The app is very buggy and it is still not very optimized for mobile devices. There are really a few apps like this which helps me create creative documents and presentation however it is not really give me a comfortable experience, on the contrary it makes me feel rage because I can't even easily do a copy paste which is a very simple thing to do!!. Fix it please devs, This app really has so much potential and making it harder to use is putting it to waste."
"I've been using this app for some time now, it was pretty good, the download speed wasn't really the fastest to begin with, but I've realized lately, that the download speed is extremely horrendous. I cannot believe this has not been fixed yet. And worst of all, it won't even download on the phone, it just brings it Â¼ of the way then show u some quote and it stays like that for the rest of time. Y'all can do much better. And don't even tell me to update the app, because the app is fully updated"
"Tried out this app to create a logo and pretty impressed by it so far. But it won't let me start the FREE trial because my google pay account has an insufficient balance. So now I'm wondering, is it a free trial or a forced subscription ? It's a real shame, because if the pro version brings in all the added features I'd be more than happy to pay for the whole thing. One would think that the purpose of a free trial would precisely be to allow users to check if it's the right app for them..."
"So far so good, I have been using this app for almost six months now and it works great with wonderful templates. This app surely need a person who is patient in terms of waiting, because at times its takes time to show features, so if the person isn't patient then he/she might quite in using it. Otherwise, I appreciate having access to this app cause am now using and enjoying pro. How I wish to you y'all is that acquire the pro level and enjoy watermarks with wonderful. Thank you............."
"The app never loads and constantly is ""disconnected"" from the network while the app is open and is the reason why it wont load; even tho the internet connection is strong and very much connected to every other app tha I use. i dont know if it's a bug or a system error but it is a inconveinece and slows down my work progress"
Having the same issue everyone is complaining about. Text box automatically adds huge spaces between your texts and I am unable to get rid of it. The design ends up just closing or deleting itself and all my work is lost. Extremely frustrating. Will be Uninstalling and looking for another app that works
"The app glitches when you download a video the text goes funnie, Canva reply and tell you to use a different browser? I tried a different browser and still the same issue, anyway I thought it was the app downloading. I tried to make 2 videos, both a template and a new design, when I viewed them while designing they worked fine, as soon as I went to download the videos I had made with the APP not the BROWSER the text messed up, this app would be great if it didn't glitch."
Unreliable. I can't type anything without the textboxes going haywire and now I'm expericing lags. The site's Helpdesk is designed to only hear what they want to hear and the most recent reviews for this app are all suspiciously positive despite their lack of information. Clearly the developers are too apathetic towards the careers of their consumer base.
I love Canva. I use it for everything for my business. But for some reason this mobile app won't display text properly. When I go on and try to edit a word it changes every word on the project to that word. It was doing it on my previous phone. I now have a new device and it still does it. I tried reinstalling it. It works on my laptop but this mobile app has become completely useless to me. It's clearly the app not my device. I would love to give 5 stars because I love Canva but not this app.
The app is nice and pretty good but bad also because whenever I finished making video it freeze and restart itself I just hate it can't you just fix it canva ?????? I can't even make my video ðª even just fix it. I am not saying it bad but it just freezing again and again itself and restart also.
"i love the app until it becomes very slow to load. it's very inconvenient for students like me who have lots of assignments and all of them must be designed and edited by Canva but it takes hours or even more to reload just for 1 design. now im thinking about designing my projects with other apps because it's really becoming a waste of time waiting to load and reload even though i have done all the necessary troubleshooting. try to focus on this problem, canva!"
I use to love canva and have used it for my business designs successfully for quite some time now. However I've now been continuing to pay for canva pro for months with no fix to a VERY frustrating bug in the app where the spacing and entering goes WILD. It makes the entire app unusable and I'm not sure what I'm paying 13 a month for anymore.
"canva need to declutter it's home screen, due to so many design appearing on first screen it requires high internet connectivity when open which is not possible all the times hence there is noticable lag in everything even on a decent device, also please change the network dialogue (it's taking longer than expected to load, kindly check your internet connection) it kill all the creativity in one second, replace it with some thing better... update: the connection issue is far worse now ,-2 star"
"My rating would never change unless I see a chabge within the app. Everytime I open it, it always says ""apps takes longer to reload"" even if my internet is stable and strong. I need to close the app and open it a lot of times for it to load properly which is really a hassle."
"I hadn't even tried and design a picture or image yet because when I was sabout to edit, it's taking too long to load the picture and I couldn't wait anymore because I do not have too much patience. And it said that I should check my internet but the Wi-Fi was alright and I tried reloading and nothing happens. It just keeps loading."
The premium sections won't work unless you randomly stumble upon them while browsing. You click to view premium templates for example and it won't take you to them. Its such a glitchy app! When I reached out to customer service they were sending condescending copy-and-paste messages and refused to help me. UPDATE: I did do that and they said only YOU can handle this. Stop scamming people ð
"Constantly my reviews are removed. Not wasting my time to write it again. In a nutshell pro is too expensive p/m. Lower to $2-5 p/m and it would be OK anything higher is a waste of money, there are better value apps out there. Don't get caught up in the hype. Constant freezes. Frustrating bugs."
"Anytime I add text, I am constantly fighting the glitch or bug adding hundreds of lines. I have had to restart more times than I can count. It is extremely frustrating when trying to complete a project."
"Ever since the code was changed to match the iOS version, the app has been breaking left and right. Channels and entire servers becoming inaccessible, constant app restarting, no indicator of who is being pinged during a reply, the list goes on. There have simply been too many errors on the app as of late, and instead of fixing them, more features are being piled on. The app's issues need to be addressed and fixed."
"(re-edit: reinstalling the app had a temporary effect, all the earlier problems are back.) The app is extremely buggy after the latest few updates. It forgets that I am replying half the time, opens the wrong channel when clicking on a notification, and sometimes just fails to update any channels. Sometimes, the keyboard doesn't appear after touching a text field, but the rest of the ui still gets disabled. I am pretty much sticking to the webapp from now on."
"Discord mobile is complete garage and it makes me wish I wasn't so entrenched in the ecosystem. It frequently has trouble loading messages, and often can show me a new reply as a notification, but doesn't have the text in the actual chat. The past few months it's been showing the wrong chat / server when you try to open a conversation and the only way to fix it is to restart the app. The people who work on this should be embarrassed that such basic functionally is so bad."
"Discord on PC is pretty solid. The app on the other hand is a buggy, poorly optimized mess. Every update brings more and more problems, and makes the app more unstable. Want your chats to randomly de-load until you completely restart the app? Like having your ability to reply to messages randomly stripped for no reason? Boy, do I have the app for you! Discord, please, I beg, replace the ""developers"" working on your half-baked app. It's been like this for two years. Something has to be done."
"Editing as the issue was somehow misunderstood. The app is working fine, this is a complaint about the voice record mic button that is next to the emoji button. It's ""convenient"" location makes it exceedingly easy to hit on accident since it is right next to the emoji button and is also where the enter button is located. Please give us an option to disable it. No one on my server likes it, we all hit it by mistake all the time because of its location."
"How does a chat platform break the chat function of their own dang app? This app went from being functionally excellent to unusable almost instantly. I'll get notifications for messages, but they won't appear in the chat. I'll have to force close and then reopen the app just to get the latest messages to display. Even worse is the fact that I can no longer switch channels without jumping through the same hoop. It only shows the last channel I was in despite being in a different one."
"I am updating this review to lower it. I reached out to customer service and got no support, and the problems are worse now. I like being able to communicate with my team on our war game. However, on my Android phone I have to uninstall and reinstall this app at least once a day. If I turn my phone the wrong way while trying to open or use discord, all of a sudden my channels show up as no text channels. The only solution is for me to uninstall and reinstall. It's getting very annoying."
Buggy as heck. Messages don't send or the app freezes and crashes after sending one or two messages. Menus and chat rooms dissapear only to randomly reappear and work normal after clearimg the cache data. This happens every time I open the app. The PC version isn't as buggy as this but it doesn't have some of the features the mobile does. This is the only reason I've been trying to keep this app but it just gets worse with every update so i may be uninstalling soon and just use the PC version.
"Update: April 19th 2023. I don't know what is going on with this update but I've disconnected multiple times in calls lasting a few hours. All of a sudden, I'm suddenly talking to myself and not in a call. There's absolutely no cue for this (no disconnection sound or anything). Also, for a few updates now the cameras freeze up in calls. It then says it's a connection issue but it can't be. The only way around it seems to be constantly disconnecting and reconnecting the call."
"Clicking on videos/images to zoom in gets really buggy. Every time I click on a video to get it to go fullscreen, it'll put it in the corners or sides of my screen, cut off partially, and mind you; still not fullscreen (or just causes the video to go blank entirely.) Also, having gifs automatically play used to work just fine on mobile, but since about November of last year, even having 3 or more gifs almost freezes up the whole app."
"Channels are literally unusable on Android right now. Multiple times a day I have to completely log out of the app and log back in to be able to use any channels I'm part of. I have tried uninstalling, as well as restarting the device, which does not fix it, so the issue is clearly not on my end. ETA submitted a support ticket, was told this was a known issue and ""a fix is being worked on"" this is far from a new issue, and has been ongoing for months."
"The new UI preview they just added is terrible, and if this is going to be a permanent change, I don't want it. Everything takes more effort to reach, and everything is extra cramped (the server list used to show 15 icons, now it only fits 6 for example). Doesnt fix the problems that the old UI had either, like how the video call and Nitro gift buttons are way too easy to press accidentally. Disable auto updates before its too late, you don't want to be stuck with this new UI when it goes live."
"UI does not work well on all devices, especially with streaming. Audio quality is horrible even for Nitro users with new, up-to-date devices. Have to drop out of calls and go back in when switching to bluetooth, big pain, especially when you think ppl can hear u and they can't. Sometimes, when switching between server chat and private messages, the server chat will show up where your private messages should be, and you have to restart the entire app in that case, sometimes while clearing cache"
"I have Discord for communication with my publisher. They have many channels that I can easily access on the desktop. For whatever reason, the mobile app frequently gets stuck in a random channel. When stuck, there is no means of seeing the other channels, let alone accessing them on the mobile app."
"Constantly have to reinstall the app so I can see everything. The categories constantly disappearing. - update apparently this is an issue that's being worked on so until then... Updating again don't mistake putting up with a buggy app for being understanding. I don't understand why this hasn't been fixed yet. I have to tolerate it in order to engage in my community. Quote from Letter Kenny ""Figure it out."""
"Ever since the beginning of May of this year, the app doesn't work on my Google Pixel. I can see the server list, but every single one says that there's no text channels. It was working perfectly fine a few days ago but now its completely broken and unusable. EDIT: Had to uninstall, reinstall, and log-in again It now works."
"App continues to become less stable over time with every bloated feature update. Messages intermittently don't go through, display/GUI displays messages from one channel or conversation when you're not actually in that channel anymore, image uploads intermittently no longer work, text size changes at random, it's horrible to use. Soon enough it'll be bad enough I'll switch to Guilded and start all over."
"Still having a crashing issue due to one of my friends tryna send an invite with a diecast racing series he does with his server. Every time an invite tries to resolve whenever I go to click on his channel, the app disturbingly crashes out of total randomness. No apps are supposed to have these bizarre crashes that just freak out and crash unexpectedly. Everything was going good until recently Discord. Great concept with the app and all, but I'm pretty much over it at this rate."
"Suddenly unable to load images when selecting the ""view all"" option, and unable to post non-recent images as a result. This is not an issue of failing to send images; it is an issue of failing to load the image library which subsequently prevents even trying to sending images bc i cannot select or see any. No network connection will fix this issue. In fact, it seems to be trying to open a file explorer app I've deleted from my phone."
"Every single update makes it worse. Ever since voice messages rolled out on mobile, connecting to voice chat has never been more impossible, since it refuses to finish connecting no matter what you try. Want to find out what the name of an emote you can't quite tell what it is immediately from your menu? Can't do it in situations like reacting, stickers, or just pulling up the menu to look further. Hope you enjoy all the accidental emotes sent while you try to scroll through that menu, too. Etc."
"I've had so many problems with this app and I just updated it. With the new update, everytime I go into another chat with one friend, the chats from my other friends conversations transfer over to my other friends chat so I can only see one friends chats even if I go to multiple friends chats. This is one among many problems I'm having with this app. I think it's very annoying and frustrating because usually with a new update, you'd think it'd be better and not have glitches."
"The last month or so of using discord has been a disaster. Constant freezes and channels not loading. Every update makes another device fail. Reinstalling works for a bit, and then not. I have sent numeremails to support. I have been reassured that they are on the problem, but I really doubt it because NOTHING has improved. Fix this. Unfortunately, I need this app."
"Great platform, awful app. Discord decided to axe the native Android version of their app for a React native version that iOS has had for much longer. Updating from native to the React version has introduced countless regressions including messages constantly not displaying or appearing to not have sent, displaying the wrong messages for the selected channel, and intermittent unresponsiveness. I wish I could go back to the old version. The basics working are more important than fluff."
"[update: I'm still having to uninstall and reinstall multiple times a day. Wifi and data get the same result] Most recent update has too many bugs and errors. I'm constantly uninstalling and reinstalling the app multiple times each day. It's not my connection, it's the app. All channels disappear except one, which becomes read only and ""no text channels."" It's such a pain and only started happening about 7-10 days ago. Desktop is fine and app used to be great, but no longer."
"It's sad that the mobile app is so terrible and has so many issues. About 70% of the time the app is unable to load anything in text channels, embedded links barely work, and completely unable to update the app because from I can tell the updates haven't been pushed through the play store. So with it barely working and supper buggy when it does just don't bother with it."
"Normally I don't update this app, but I did recently, after probably a year, and now it completely drains my battery even while the screen is locked. It never did this before. I've narrowed it down to discord because I did a factory reset on my phone and everything is completely normal with all my apps installed except discord. This is completely unacceptable."
Ive been using this app for a long while now and i highpy doubt they care enough to read this. But i crash about 20-30 times a day. Not even joking. I try and call my significant other and the app constantly crashes. Sometimes itll cut one of our audios out and well have to disconnect and reconnect to fix it. Weve both tried resetting the app. Clearing cache. And even reinstalling it entirely. Fix. This. Soon. Its been happening for a year now!!! Ill change my rating if it gets solved.
"EDIT: They're trying to roll out a TERRIBLE and UGLY UI update that changes the entire layout and makes things harder to access, so don't forget to turn off updates for this app.|| 2/23/23: Latest update has made it so I can no longer save images through the app, and a few updates ago, they made it so the layout will be messed up if you go to another app and come back to it, it's been a constant issue, when the app worked just fine before."
"Android version has been awfully buggy, causing me to restart the app way too often. Viewing new messages won't load correctly if opened from a notification, trying to reply to a msg with an image will just send it as a normal msg. Sending images sometimes gets stuck on the sending after being actually sent. Has been driving me insane how this hasn't been fixed for weeks. Have reinstalled multiple times with it still being broken, switched off and back from stable to beta with the same issues"
"No text channels. I cannot message anyone or get my other channels, older messages. Seems like all the reviews are having the same sort of issues. Uninstalling and resetting does not fix the issue and if I try to send in a remedy ticket, some of the boxes, I cannot answer because I am not the person incharge of the channel or I have no idea where to find the info to input into the required field"
"Thankfully most of those major bugs are gone now, but I still can't get consistent loading after I hop back into the app. It says ""Connecting..."" and doesn't finish connecting. I have to do a shut down of the app and restart it to be able to use it again. I have to do that so many times every day."
"Third update: Tired of coming back to update it. As of now the overlay finally works. As for the consistent crashing and video not loading, yet to see any fixes. I've tried everything. Support had me go through the works and actually ended up insulting/lying to me by the end of the interaction. If I didn't have nearly a decade into this app I'd be done with it entirely. I wish it was only an app only issue. However problems still persist even on PC."
"Constant issues with this app. Every update is a new batch of problems. For some reason the app now has the ability to adjust the volumes on my PC. The individual volumes for people on the phone need to be much higher. They do not need to be that high on my PC. Yet, even if I adjust them on PC it'll randomly reset to whatever my app is set to. If this was intentional this was the worst decision, if it was not please fix it. Actually, fix it either way. this should not be a default setting."
"The newest update (3/8/2023) sucks. The bugs were not fixed, but only made worse. Audio coming through my phone now gets picked up by the mic when this was never a problem before. Alongside this, the green ""watching stream"" banner on top covers a quarter of the screen and cuts off gameplay, and the screen cannot be moved to reveal it in any capacity. This is incredibly frustrating, especially since it was working in an acceptable capacity beforehand, the blueprints were literally right there."
"I've used this app for years, and it's always been great to me up until now. I constantly open discord and there's the ""connecting..."" at the top, despite me being on wifi. There's the occasional bug where I'll open the app and all pictures and videos are blown up, and I can only see half. If I hold to react, it makes my screen slightly darker, but nothing pops up. It's become almost unusable from the connection alone."
"This app has become completely useless. For a couple weeks now every channel will vanish and the only way I can access a channel is if I get a notification for it. When I click on the notification, it will be read only, preventing me from responding. Once you close it down, that channel is no longer available unless I get another notification. Only way to fix is to do a reinstall, only to have it happen again the next day. Many others on my server are experiencing the same issue."
"This is my third review of this app now. After my initial negative review, their support replied to me suggesting fixes. I did those fixes, and they worked, briefly. Now the app is back the way it was. It CONSTANTLY struggles to connect. I find myself needing to reboot the app all the time just to load messages, even on full bars of WiFi service. It's like the app gives up on staying connected every time I send a message. Very frustrating to use."
"I can't use this app anymore. For months I've been dealing with constant freezing because the performance of the app has gotten so bad. If I was lucky it would unfreeze after a minute or so. Now, it just flat out crashes every time. I can't go a minute without getting kicked out. I've restarted my phone, reinstalled the app, and even tried the beta version. At this point I'm just going to start texting people because it's clear that discord doesn't care about optimization anymore"
"Not all changes are good. Please allow things like directly sending voice clips to be outright disabled. I won't use it and learning a new layout is annoying when it constantly comes with pop-ups. Additionally, new features are nice, but fixing baseline Functionality and crashing comes first. A big one would also maybe be, if you lose access to an emoji, it shows as a ghost rather than removed. I use discord daily, much like a car, I dont want the layout to constantly change."
"They really ruined this and it wasn't great to begin with. Problems with videos and images loading. If you're on mobile in voice chat, the volume of your voice changes randomly. They didn't fix any of the old problems, either. Made worse once again. Videos and images are cut off on the right side of the screen there's no visible play button so I have no way of knowing if it's a video or an image."
"okay. great platform, what is going on with the mobile client?? recently it's been insanely buggy, making menus appear in lines literally 1 character wide, cutting photos off of the screen, not playing videos *period,* hanging a lot when typing, and most annoyingly, a constant ""connecting"" notification at the top of the screen even when my connection is fine. that's not even to mention the amount of json errors I've encountered in the past month. please fix bugs. we don't need activities."
"Functions as simple as saving someone's nickname on a server no longer work when using the mobile app. Ever since they switched to a different version of Discord for the Android app, it's been inconvenience after inconvenience. I enjoyed the extra options at first, but the pros have far outweighed the cons at this point. As of the latest update, I am unable to even edit the channel order in my own servers. The app is starting to feel unusable as a server owner."
"Chat channels disappear frequently. Happens several times a day. Have to delete & reinstall the app to get the groups back. Been an issues since mid/late August. Had to downgrade my review a star to get any response from support after trying to contact them. After giving me the run around for another month trying to make it seem like I was doing something wrong, support just said it's a known issue & that's all. Reached out to support again and still no end in sight for the issue. App is trash."
The app was more or less fine before this newest update. Now it's almost unusable. Embedded videos keep playing after you exit them and sometimes continue playing out of app. The app is overall slower. Loading past messages is now a pain. Call audio constantly switches from Bluetooth earbuds to the phone speakers and can't be fixed unless the call is dropped (extremely annoying) and many other bugs/ bad ui decisions. Edit: it's been over half a year and most of the bugs are still here.
"When I'm in a DM and click on a person's profile, or when I click Edit a message, the menus are HUGE TEXT with small margin so I have to scroll endlessly to see and select menu options. Fix the scaling and margins of pop up boxes. PLEASE. Been an issue for about 2 months. Can't believe it hasn't been fixed yet"
"Has everything you could want in a social app without issues or annoying adds interrupting you all the time. This was my old review at 5 stars. Now I'm changing it to 1 star. The app is having problems with messages. I will click on a channel or another chat, and it'll show the same chat I just left. Also it won't show the new messages. If I close the app and reopen it, it won't show the messages I just sent."
"Since the most recent update, Discord is broken. Constantly losing channel info and returning a 'no text channels' error (can confirm on pc the channels are indeed there, only this phone version can't find them). Reinstalling Discord and restarting the phone does nothing, the program is in dire need of repair. Wait until an update before you install."
"Constant issues and functionality pitfalls every update. 2nd last update added a problem where DMs could show up as the only text channel in every server. This update turned every server into 'no text channels"". All empty. Desktop works fine, and in addition i can successfully add text channels in my own server despite not seeing any of them. this bug makes it literally unusable for anything besides DMs. If i didn't know any better I'd think they outsourced their work to chatgpt."
"Every update for the past 3 updates has made the app worse as far as bugs, functionality, etc. At this point, altogether, I am experiencing: crashes, loading hangs, servers and DMs being ""read only"" until I close the app and reopen, long-press menu not actually opening until I close the app and reopen, and images loading as too large for the screen. It's maddening. Every time I hope an update will fix something, it doesn't, just seems to add something else onto the pile..."
"Loved this app for years but I unfortunately have to use it less and less, and thinking about uninstalling it to be honest. With these few new updates to come out I can't send any videos if they have previously been converted. I'm trying to show my gf something and it never gets past the new ""compression"" prosses. No mater what compression app I use it'll still never get past that stage of sending. This app is really going down hill"
"Hey I'm putting up a negative rating until Discord quits focusing on dumb new features no one asked for, I'm tired of auto sounds mid game for starters, and instead focus on application health. It is currently using a lot of resources but crashing or otherwise running into errors. Quit with the bells and whistles and focus on usability."
"Accept that if you're on mobile, most updates will mess up your ability to use the app, and then you'll have to wait awhile before they fix it. The most recent update from last night has almost completely removed my ability to see anything on ANY server, including the one I'm a moderator for. Just shows up as ""No text channels"" on 99% of them."
"This is THE worst mobile communication app. It used to be the best, but now all calls are unstable. Lots of times, it doesn't pick up voice or it'll cut in and out. Share screen has the same bug since the IOS merge. It will randomly automatically close and disconnect the entire call without even a sound. If you close it manually, it automatically crashed the entire app. Notifications aren't delivered, calls have no ring, doesn't recognize touch input for profile stuff. It's awful now :("
"For months now the app won't let anyone watch videos without it randomly pausing and never playing again, it crashing entirely on its own for trying to load the small video, or it is stuck on a infinite loading loop no matter how many times you try and restart the app. A simple, small file video being impossible to watch on mobile is annoying and bizarre. It's been like this for multiple updates. Fix it."
"I've had this app since 2018. I have had no issues with it up until now. Not only have they removed the feature where you can type emoticons without it changing it to emojis, but there's also this issue where it'll say ""connecting"" no matter how long you wait and you have to restart the app, and no it doesn't matter how strong your internet connection is. I will keep this at a one star rating until you finally decide to fix your app. Other than that this app is amazing."
"Can't even slide to see member lists due to it bringing up the message reply now. There was already a way to reply, why inhibit functionality for no reason? The horizontal sliding for both directions was key to the app's feel. It's only able to be done by a button in one spot now, which is worse for accessibility, especially one handed as phone apps are typically used, than being able to slide anywhere on the screen. What an unnecessary and frustrating change."
"To be honest it's a great app! Easy to chat, call, share videos, and play. I'd give it two more stars if it wasn't for many issues. Especially with more updates. Messaging is now very laggy on both computer and phone for some weird reason. It crashes calls randomly on my phone half the time when I leave the discord app for a single moment for no reason now!? Fyi this is a recent problem since march 1, 2023. It wasn't this bad before!"
"So many things have gone wrong since the last update. Everytime someone I'm in a call with turns on their camera, after a few minutes it freezes and doesn't come back until I close the app and reopen it. When I click on pictures, I can't exit out of them, so I have to, again, close the app and reopen it. And my back button no longer works to back out of dms or pictures, just closes the app completely. Please fix soon."
"I have been using discord on PC for years. It's smooth, easy to use, customizable, with little to no bugs. The mobile version isn't. I disconnect from calls, people can't hear me, I can't see pictures, it's laggy, and sometimes just crashes all together. No advice, I'm just uninstalling on my phone."
"For months has been extremely buggy, with images and buttons being halfway offscreen, and often times just not working when interacted with. And recently server or personal dms just simple won't load all, instead displaying as if the account was just made. No bugs have been fixed in over half a year at this point. Each month just bring worse bugs and no fixes."
"I have a Google pixel 5 phone and discord constantly stops working properly. It will be fine, then all of a sudden all my groups disappear or the general server and when I can see it, it will say read only/ no text channels and I can't respond. I'm in a school group/groups and need this to work. Clearing the cache or stopping doesn't do anything, I have to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work again. Then the cycle continues. My internet is strong, so that's not it. So frustrating!!"
"I'm an avid user of discord, it's the primary tool I use to talk to friends and keep up with game updates. The newest update for mobile discord sucks. It takes away from how easy it used to be to switch between channels, servers, and private DMs. It also takes away from server groupings. What's the point of grouping different servers if now I have to scroll through all of them again. Please revert to the previous layout. The current UI is unhelpful."
"Half the time I go to use my emojis the only ones available are the default ones and sometimes from a server or two, even though I have nitro and have for a year. I've never ever had this issue before. It fixes itself when I log out and log back in but then lo and behold a few hours later it's back to being buggy. I have the latest update so that's certainly not the issue."
"The updates keep making the app unusable. It's like each new update they're trying to make our lives harder. The most recent and annoying update is when you're swiping left in a server channel so you can view members, checked pinned messages, or search messages, it makes you automatically reply to whatever message you happened to swipe on. It's annoying and makes things difficult. STOP updating the app if you're going to insist on giving us these useless and terrible ""features""!"
"Extreme lag and have to close the app do to infinite loading screen, i know its not on my end because all of my friends and some people in other servers are complaining about it too. Its been going on for MORE than a few months and is honestly getting annoying. I waited to say anything about it in case it was a quick fix (like it should be) but apparently its the least of your problems. Clasic discord doing less than the bare minimum, as always."
Horrible. Any time I want to change the volume on someone or the noise gate I have to spend 10 minutes trying to get the touchscreen to slide SIDEWAYS when these little drawers they make prioritize swiping VERTICALLY. Fix your app. I miss when the layout was different from iOS because this is just completely unoptimized. And no. I'm not writing a ticket just for a canned response from your FreshDesk.
"I can't leave discord open in the background because when I pop back in, it completely crashes and doesn't load any of my channels. It's become second nature to close discord as I leave it because it just, won't load otherwise. Not to mention it sometimes doesn't even load when I haven't clicked out of the app, just switching between channels. I have to click around to hope it fixes itself or just close the app in its entirety. Annoying."
"Recent changes bring with them a load of new problems. Unable to add emojis to text channels from mobile. Now, as of the most recent update, sliding in the open chat forces a reply, rather than opening the friend menu like it has ALWAYS done. PLEASE add a way to disable this ""feature"" in accessibility. I can't use the app like this. This single change, changes the way the app has always functioned. Please let me disable this reply feature. Please."
"After updating the app, the notification times in the notification bar are not accurate. For example, if I get a message/ping in one channel or from one person 20 minutes ago, then I another message/ping in the channel or from the same person later, it'll still say 20 minutes ago instead of updating to ""just now,"" ""5 minutes ago, etc"". Also sometimes when viewing a notification in notification bar, it'll disappear almost immediately without me swiping it away - this has happened a few times."
"Suboptimal. Ever since Discord was switched to the iOS version for every mobile platform, my exprience has gone downhill. Wonky UI that shrinks and grows on a whim, images and videos I upload not showing up, the app freezing when I try to commit simple actions, chats not changing when switching channels, frequent difficulties connecting to internet even when I have perfect internet connection. Clearly no thought has been put into the mobile experience in recent days."
The newest addition of swipe right to reply is completely intrusive and degrades the whole app experience for me. I keep unintentionally replying with this update. I GENUINELY CANNOT think of anyone who has to reply as much as they do check the user list. Please either revert this change make this a toggle-able feature. Having to tap the top right to access the user list rather than swipe right does not even remotely feel intuitive at all. Thanks.
"The Android app is entirely unusable and unreleasable. I previously tried to detail some of the most severe issues as best I could, but after months of deterioration it seems there's little point. Sticking to desktop is the best choice, as usual. Also, the update notes don't include the changelog."
"Discord takes its sweet time connecting. I get notifications saying a message was sent but then when i click the notification or open the app, it takes up to two minutes to connect and actually show me the message which doesnt make sense because it obviously knew the mesaage was there already. I experience this on multiple internet connections and phones, tried uninstalling, and factory resetting and discord still has this issue and others experience it as well. I miss time sensitive messages."
"Edit 3/14/23: Chat previews and buttons in the new interface don't look great with bigger fonts/zoom. Issues like sliders for volume, sensitivity, etc. not working rendering them unadjustable and weird cropping of emojis in statuses have not been fixed. Please fix these things before working on nonessential cosmetic changes. Glad the new UI can be disabled because it's too reliant on buttons/tapping. Not being able to swipe to access different menus on the new interface was a bit frustrating."
"Honestly the mobile app was amazing and I had no issues with it... Until the iOS/Android merge. Ever since then, it has gotten so bad, I physically can't log in any more and I can't use it. 1. It kept telling me I had no internet service and couldn't show me my discord until I reset it enough (till it worked). 2. Constantly bugged or crashed with images, and gifs no longer load properly at times. 3. Doesn't send backup code on log in 4. If you respond to a text in VC it infinitely crashes."
"Buggy mess. Flips phone sideways? Crash. Want to check to see member list? Crash. Want to click on someone's profile? Shows up in this small but rectangular shape and even shows stuff like ""regional indicator"" which shouldn't show up at all. Screenshots you post are not visible to you until you re-launch the app. Somehow, this app managed to be worse than the desktop version."
"Update: Turning this into a 1-star. Bugs got worse and is now so bad, you can't join voice channels, reply, react, or access other basic functions. Absolutely ridiculous. ***** Original Review: Coming from an iPhone to a Pixel 7 Pro, I was expecting a similar experience with Discord. Instead I was met with buginnes, sluggishness, and straight up missing features. These are a few problems that I have experienced that are seemingly a real issue. Please fix this Discord and make your app usable."
"Edit: Mar-23. Discord app is still not back to parity with where the old version was before the big change 7 months ago. The sharing aspect is the worst. I can't type any additional message with what I'm sharing because the text box is tiny. And the screen is all faded when I'm sharing, I can barely even read the screen. Then when I do share it just puts me in a random chanel - not the channel where I shared something. I love this service, I'm a Nitro subscriber. But this android app sucks."
Ever since they changed the UI to be the one from iPhone the experience has been terrible. Every update introduces some new problem that makes Discord borderline unusable. Right now it's not sizing images properly in chat (they clip off the side of the screen) and the app randomly has void space while scrolling that blocks any text from appearing. Can't read chats or server lists. App is unusable. Fix this junk.
"So I purchased 10 Boosts for a special occasion inside a server I'm in, a week later I cancel it so I wouldn't be billed a large amount of money again and I could start using standard nitro. It wasn't until two weeks I looked at my billing information and discovered it never canceled my subscription! I went to look at purchase history and noticed that it is was absent along with last months, it has never done that. It says I'm due a renewal next month and I don't know how to cancel! Please fix!"
"I am literally incapable of sending specifically screenshots anymore, which is what I want to send most of the time. When I try to it just immediately deletes the image off of discord, but that only happens for screenshots for some reason. The performance on mobile is also SO laggy, anytime I immediately go into the app and try to text someone, my keyboard lags out and I have to re open the app again."
"Never used to be like this but starting recently I can't use my mic 95% of the time. I'll click on my mic button for the talk-to-text feature, and it will immediately shut itself off again. Very frustrating. Uninstalling it and then reinstalling it fixes it but for a very short time before it reverts back to being non-viable and. Please fix this!"
"Discord is my go-to chat client for when I need to communicate with my friends and customers online. However, I recently updated my app for the first time in months and after one day I already regret updating. Now my phone slows down whenever I open it, and when I try to navigate channels it loads the wrong messages, profiles take forever to pop up, and other irritating things involving the app being slow. Discord is almost unusable on my phone now. I didn't have these issues before yesterday."
"I've been a discord user for years, and while the PC experience is just fine, the mobile version continues to go downhill. Swapping apps and then back into Discord will no longer load channels and give me a permanent ""connecting..."" until I close and reopen several times. Uploading images or gifs do not display them until I reset the app a few times. The update today now no longer lets me use any emotes at all, except the phone default (I am a Nitro subscriber as well). Plenty other bugs as well"
"Edit: No, I'm not emailing you. Read my review, it says exactly what is wrong. Used to be able to slide from the right to see the member list. Now it's some stupid reply function. I don't need that and if you're going to make workflow breaking changes at least have the common decency to announce it up front. Don't hide behind some link to change notes."
"EDIT: Dear Discord, I am not going to go to a separate site to report a bug. If you took the time to read this and respond you can log it too. If you didn't read it, you won't read it regardless of where I post it. _____ The app used to work well, but after I updated the UI glitches all the time. The reaction bar opens only a fraction of the way so I can't move through or click anything. Images I post aren't visible to me after I post them (I see that dumb poo placeholder)."
The new swipe feature is HORRIBLE. Reply already had long press. It's rendered quickly seeing users impossible. Always loved discord until this update. I keep accidentally replying to messages now and it's super annoying as an admin in a personal server. Listen to your users and change the swipe feature back. Literally no one asked for that change.
First broken feature. The audio or lack there of. If you plug in a headset that doesn't have a microphone then it won't use your built-in phone mic. This is a basic feature that works fine when calling someone. Microphone audio is always distorted and robotic while on mobile data and pretty awful over Wi-Fi too. And the camera feature. You can't have your camera open while you're in another app. So screw you if you wanted to listen to music while you chat with friends and have your camera on.
"Can I undo this update? It was 10000x better before..It is now far too frustrating and completely unusable. It lags and freezes constantly, the haptic feedback is unbearable, the interface is excessively compact, and probably more issues present, but frozen after 5 mins. Tried to cram too much ""oolala"" into it and managed to remove basic functionality. Disappointing."
"Something happened and now my calls go through my phone rather than connecting to my Bluetooth headphones. Update 2/26/23, discord and phone already been updated. Followed all tutorials attempting to fix the Bluetooth connection issue. No dice. It works fine on the desktop but calls on discord mobile are NOT WORKING. It gives the sound that the call is accepted but the audio of the person I'm talking to is through phone."
"The update made this app even worse. Sometimes opening the app causes an infinite ""Connecting"" message at the top with nothing loading, despite the issue NOT being my internet/data connection or the Discord servers being down. The only way to (temporarily) fix it is by closing the app and reopening it, but this is frustrating to always do. Videos I send taken in portait mode appear weirdly stretched out. And plus, custom emojis don't show up despite being in my list of uploaded emojis."
"App literally doesn't work lol, channels will only load after I restart the app on the desired channel. Reinstalling does not fix. Glad the devs have time to add more premium features though instead of fixing the app ð (Update to developer response. I have used multiple different connection types. I have also reinstalled the app and that did not fix the issue. The issue seems to start at 8:30pm est and end around 10:30pm est. This is the third day in a row of this happening."
"I honestly don't know anymore. The app use to run fine untill now, the app just constantly keeps crashing when I open the app. That's just it, can't really do anything about other then I just might unstall it. I used this app for years but now the year of 2023 I have encountered way to many problems, I kinda hopped that this app will be fixed but I highly doubt it. Open the app then instantly crashes over and over and over after opening it multiple times.... I give up."
"Since the Summer 2022 Discord Android app framework change: poor performance, very buggy, WON'T DISPLAY GIFS NOW!! PLEASE FIX ASAP! And please, PLEASE fix Bluetooth Voice Channel quality by adding the old audio improvement option back please, after years!! Fix the Call Mode option, let us control our own quality settings! The sound quality is AWFUL! Just do it already! Thanks. 1 star app."
"Original review ""Call keeps dropping whenever I lock my phone - Google pixel 7"" Update: It was fine for two weeks but after updating the app I am back to the same issue. Everytime I lock my phone I am connected to the call for a minute or two before I get disconnected. The worst part about it, it doesn't tell you that you're disconnected. Everyone on the call just goes silent whenever I open the app again then ""disconnected"" chime finally goes off. Tried all possible solutions"
"I hate the new swipe-to-reply more than words can describe, I keep accidentally calling people trying to open the tab that I USED to be able to swipe to, I'm frustrated trying to exist and scroll because I keep replying to messages, and now the app feels less comfy and accessible to use. Navigating Discord feels very gross now that the wrong touch sends me to the reply all hell-zone. Bad. Bad Discord. Get back in the corner with the font changes."
"Too many disconnects/ taking too long to connect, and reading reviews I'm not the only one. Also seeing this issue across the board it shouldn't have to be submitted as a support ticket it just needs *fixed* in general. It's frustrating, more so when there are people who actually pay for all the bells and whistles for things not to work. Between using my data or wifi it's bad. People also shouldn't have to switch to their data for things to work either."
"This app regardless of PC or mobile used to be phenomenal. The last few updates have caused the mobile app to deteriorate, not changing screens when I view different channels or private messages, not being able to see entire menus, or when you send a message the interface just doesn't update showing the message, have to force close the app and re open to see it. I'm not sure what they have been doing the last few updates, but I hope it gets better."
"It was a good app, but it has been a complete disaster over last few weeks! It often fails to sync messages and constantly keeps showing wrong channels to me. The title of the channel is correct but all messages are from a random different channel, sometimes even from a different server. What a mess! Fixes itself after I kill the app and open again but really annoying to do that 10+ times a day. And I never know if I'm seeing latest messages or not."
"Used discord for YEARS. Never before has it been this broken. Voice calls are impossible to use unless your phone is still and upright at all times, the app completely reboots if you rotate your screen, elements aren't accessible due to some of them having the wrong resolution so they don't fit the screen, and the app crashes without a word mid call several times within the hour. And now it keeps crashing when trying to access settings. I don't know what you did but by god, it's unbearable."
"Still an issue. Your latest update causes my 2 fitbits (different phones and accounts) to stop syncing throughout the day. I stop getting notifications on both watches. Automatic Time Zones always fails. Always. It always disables itself. Every time I go to a new time zone, I have to turn it back on to Automatic. Every time. Updating the watch can take up to 20 minutes and the app tells you to keep the updating window open until complete... update: still Bad. Doesn't register 2+ hr naps anymore"
"This thing will not stop recycling email notifications! Goes off ALL the time. Most annoying issue ever. I have tried everything and stopped using it a year ago. Thought an update at some point would fix the issue, so tried it again. NOPE the connectivity from the watch to my phone is just as bad as before. This never happened with my galaxy watch, but the versa is a mess."
"The app itself is fine, but the actual fitbit itself is the problem. I have an Inspire 3 ,and it's fairly defective. Whenever it is cold out, the fitbit won't stay on the stopwatch screen, and it constantly vibrates. It also doesn't reset the steps or calories burned , and after a month of having the fitbit, it stopped having the points notification pop-up. The app and the device are both up-to-date. Any suggestions on how to fix it would be appreciated."
"I was a big fan of the Versa 3, and I was really excited about my new Versa 4 until I found out that they removed some essential features! I'm extremely disappointed, and I really can't recommend this watch to anyone in its current state. It feels like an unfinished product. If they do the right thing and bring back the removed features (at least give us media controls, please! My ADHD NEEDS me to be able to control my music without looking at my phone), I will happily change this to 5 stars."
"I've had 3 different fitbit devices over the last 7-ish years. I've always found issues with them syncing from time to time. Now over the last several months my device hardly ever syncs and it's even difficult to do it manually and then my data might not go through correctly. Now I've tried to sync several times last week and this week and it won't sync at all. You would think after 7 years your glitches would get less not worse. Luckily, there are other options on the market now."
"I'm sorry fitbit app sucks. First thing you will notice when using the app is a piece of useless health information that blocks half the screen. From there, you'll probably want to track some exercise. Good luck with that! You have to scroll through stupid 'mindfulness' and 'stress' features (isn't one of these uselss features enough?) to be able to find how to even log an exercise. I could go on, but after YEARS this should be better. MiBand has a much better interface!"
They took away the family/friend challenge. I had just got 5 family members on the same challenge and it was awesome! But I didn't know until I googled it to find out why. Google is disabling the app by taking features away one by one so they can focus on the Google watch. We are looking into other opposite so we can drop Fitbit. Getting rid of the challenges was a bad move for a lot of people.
"Worked great for my versa the past 2 years, until one day it just stopped syncing. I disconnected the versa from the app to reconnect it and have it sync again, and it won't connect now. Tried like 20 times. I follow all the instructions: keep the versa nearby, charge it to 50% and keep it charging, connect the phone to good WiFi, turn off the Bluetooth and back on, restart both devices even, and still nothing. It'll find the versa, take the code, then fail to connect after a long load. Great!"
"This app is HORRIBLE!!! Daily trouble syncing. Every day I have to turn Bluetooth off and on, force stop app, then a lot of time have to uninstall then reinstall app to get it to sync. Even after all of that it still won't sync sometimes. I wish I hadn't bought the tracker and definitely would not pay for the premium. It's awful, get something different."
"If you're reading this and just got a fitbit, get a refund. I'm SO sick of having to reinstall the app so that the data will actually sync. New update makes your data unreadable. Can't read peaks and valleys, breakpoints are different every day so you can't compare them visually either. After a month of this ui I don't even open the app anymore because it loads so slowly, the information I would want is never available. It always opens to yesterday's information, even after syncing."
"I have a sense 2 which works great. The app is absolutely trash. You can't manually add an exercise. You have to go to the dashboard online. The food tracker picks random items to be in your recent list. Things not even remotely recent are listed while half the food I ate the day before is not. They have continued to strip features with no replacement. Great device, horrid app."
Fitbit user for 10+ years. Probably going to switch somewhere else now. In the fall you messed up the graphing for steps and now you took away the challenges. For the first time looking for another exercise app and probably another device just because I'm so mad at you Even though I might be able to use my device with a different app. I cannot imagine what you thought would be improved by doing either of these things.
"The Charge 5 is unreliable. It doesn't count steps accurately - sometimes up to 4,000 step difference compared to a pedometer. It freezes often and fails to show that exercise goal was met for the day, although stats show goal met. Heart rate shows on watch, but not on app. Constantly resetting, but it still has problems. The app doesn't work since the most recent update. Save your money. Use another tracker and app. There are more reliable fitness trackers on the market."
"Since the recent 03/23 update, tiles are slow to load, if at all (such as timers, settings, and battery percentage when connected to charger). Versa 4 will not sync and now cannot even be found via the app. UPDATE: Did factory reset and updated Versa 4. Still won't sync and now all clock faces are ""Unavailable."" Current default clock face is all black with tiny stats you have to tap to cycle through. Does not even show the time."
"Once upon a time, a part of the Fitbit app was the group challenges. However, now someone thought it was a good idea to remove the challenges from the app. Having the various family and friends who are encouraging you to be more active is definitely a plus for so many. This is an official request to bring that feature back. No longer the best app!"
Edit: no longer have challenges available. I'm really disappointed. The challenges help keep me motivated. Really disappointed that the off switch is gone to turn off sync all day. Now it sync all the time running my battery in phone down. I kniw I can turn my blue tooth off but i have many things attached to my Bluetooth. Please bring back the option to turn off the all day sync
"I've had my Fitbit for about a year now and on 3 separate occasions the watch spontaneously stops working and displaying nothing but the power-on screen. The only way to fix it is to wait about a week for the watch to die on its own, charge it to full, immediately wipe all data from the watch, and restart until it inevitably happens again. At this point I would recommend people pursue other options for smart watches."
Just got a Charge 4 for Xmas and it stopped syncing in February and I can't figure out why. None of the troubleshooting tips work. No updates available. Clock is 6 hours off. The only thing it syncs is cals and heartrate. I'm guessing its because my Android is around 3 years old and doesn't have a compatible OS. Sorry I can't afford a brand new phone just to use my Fitbit. Fix this!
Since the update where they got rid of challenges my fitbit won't sync. My fitbit freezes and shuts off and the app is slow if it even works. Going to have to switch to a different watch and it will not be a Google one. Now I have to figure out how to cancel the premium subscription but I'm sure they will keep that money. Now it has stopped syncing. Dies at 45 percent and the watch keeps dropping my steps and changing the time to hours off. Really did an outstanding job Google.
"I've been using this app for years. thanks Google for removing the challenges and adventures feature... making my fitbit useless as that was the reason I was still wearing it. if you really wanted to improve your premium subscriptions, ADDING streaming capability to your app instead of taking away the fun factor would have helped. it was a good run. but now I'm done."
I cannot cancel my subscription! Whatever changes you all have made has made it so my subscription doesn't appear in my Google account. It is also inaccessible from the website. Please allow me to cancel before I am charged for another month! Plus you are taking away fun stuff like challenges without anything new to replace them. They are very motivational.
"For years I never had no trouble with this until I got my charge 5! Now wont sync to Bluetooth. I call for help and everybody tells me to turn it off and start it again each time. People make me go through the same scenario, but we never fix the problem. This sucks. I wish I'd never wasted my money on this charge 5. It's been the worst. My phone won't Bluetooth as it says I need an app yet. I have the app but it does not recognize fitbit app. I never wanted to go to another untill now!"
"With the last update, and the loss of challenges with friends.... This app lost 4 stars. We tried a closed group, but it isn't the same. The motivation from seeing the steps of everyone in the challenge is lacking in the closed group. This app used to keep friends across the United States working toward a common health goal. Now we are looking at other options."
The app SUCKS!!! Biggest down sides are... You need both WIFi and Bluetooth enabled to sync. You spend more time trying to fix the sync than you do using the app. It would be nice if it sync'd to the app without WiFi. Then when you have internet the app will sync to the cloud. I have over a month where my steps did not sync. A 2nd FitBit we bought doesn't even work right. As I'm writing this I went from giving 4 stars to 1
Sleep tracking stopped working properly. New to fitbit but wanted to keep up with sleep and heartbeat. Worked great. Then signed up for my 6 month trial and it stopped tracking my sleep. I've spent so much time chatting with customer service and getting case numbers just to do the same thing the next day. I haven't even had my sense for 2 weeks so maybe I'll just return it. This is frustrating.
Don't be fooled. Fitbit is a fancy motion detector. It also picks up your heartbeat. The app often misinterprets this data. It says that you didn't get any exercise after backcountry skiing for 6 hours because despite hours of aerobic workout that's just intense activity and not a recognized sport. It cannot be recalibrated for different strides (like shorter steps hiking). It's slow to download data and frequently has trouble syncing. Don't waste money buying a Fitbit. Mine was free.
"Can't log into the app. I've reinstall and even tried waiting for updates and still nothing. Also don't get enough control over screen timeout, it's my choice how long my battery lasts, not yours Fitbit. Edit: finally got an update and can log in again, but it won't sync. Really disappointed. Edit 2: tried to reinstall to fix sync. It won't login again. Def switching brands"
"Go with another brand like Garmin. The app is always running even if you try to force stop it so it is always taking up phone resources. It is constantly having issues with syncing. I just want to track my sleep and workouts, not every moment of day. I'm don't being frustrated by the sync issues. If you do have issues though, their customer service via chat is fantastic. Just want to give a positive shout out to those hard working people in their contact centers."
I have a Sense 2. Constantly having trouble with the syncing on the app and the watch entirely restarting on me at different times of the day. I used to love the sleep feature but even that stopped working on me. I'll be going back to a Samsung watch. Update: I'm seeing everyone has had the same problems as I've had.
"Fitbit trackers are junk. The digital display doesn't last long after the warranty. I had a battery issue under warranty and they replaced it with a refurbished tracker, well that went bad a few months later. They refused to replace it because they said the warranty was on the original tracker. Total BS and a scam!!!! So glad I'm switching companies to a more reliable tracker."
"I can't get the app to pair with Charge 4. It's not syncing with my device. The last sync was Feb 16, 2023 right before the app update. I tried every option in the ""Fix It"" setting, but nothing worked. I deleted the app and reinstalled, but no luck. I unpaired my Charge 4 and tried to pair it again with the app, but now my Charge 4 shows ""Download or Update the Fitbit App to set up."" I've had Fitbits since 2016 and never had an issue until they started offering ""Premium"" to get people to pay."
"Most useful info is behind a paywall. Every single time I've had to reconnect my device has been a nightmare of endless troubleshooting. It should not be this difficult to do the most basic, first action required to use this expensive device. And now I realize they've been charging me for THREE months from the ""free trial."" Very cool business practices."
I did not sleep but Fitbit shows about 1 hour each night that I did not. My heart rate was 102 at 12:45am and awake. Checking Fitbit shows a recorded rate of 70bpm and no record of the 102bpm. Really can't trust the device and app. ( I did adjust the sensitivity settings about 2 months ago attempting to correct the wrong data.) I have used the Fitbit for about a year now. I still find it recording of sleep and heart rate inconsistent and not accurate.
"I've been using fitbit for years. It was a great app until they removed the best features, claiming improvements. They no longer have any of their challenges that would keep you connected with others as well as motivation. Now, it is like any other app just facts no interaction."
"Since early November I've been having issues syncing with my Charge 5. I've restarted the Fitbit (didn't work), force stopped the app on my phone to restart Bluetooth (didn't work). The only thing that worked (for half a day) was to uninstall the app, reinstall it, & then restart my phone. Extremely aggravating. It no longer provides an error message as to why it's not syncing either. Everything was perfectly fine before. Edit: It is now April. This problem persists minus restarts & reinstalls."
"I wanted to like my Fitbit so much, but I'm so frustrated and have given up trying to make this thing work. I bought an Inspire 3 primarily for the sleep tracking. But it only once ever did non-basic sleep tracking in the month that I used it. I tried everything to make this thing work, even returned and got a new one thinking mine was just broken. Nope, it just doesn't work. I ultimately got a Withings sleep pad, which actually works as advertised."
Charge 5...Here again it will not sync to my phone. I've tried deleting the app. Turning the Bluetooth off the on again. Just keeps spinning. As much as I like fitbit over all this problem has become more than I want to deal with all the time. Maybe it's time to ditch fitbit.
"Watch shows steps, etc. Won't sync with app 3 or 4 times a week. I've had fit bit since 2012. You gonna fix this? I really don't want to start over with another company but.......this is ridiculous. Every other day the app is not showing stats. You need to fix this. This was a great company before Google bought it. You know when they cared. Still not working With your new updates, removing challenges, groups etc. Are you removing all lifetime badges? The length of life Japan? The stairs one?"
"Wish i could say no stars. Stops syncing, changes time zone automaticly, has to be charged every other day. Plus ask for support and they they give you the exact same fix everytime. This is not a one fix fixes all situation. This is my second fitbit in 2 years with the same issues, first the charge 4 and now the charge 5. May I ask what the subscription pays for because that has down sized but still being charged the same???"
Too many issues with syncing between my fitbit charge and this app. I have only had it for a week and have already wasted a lot of time trying to get it to work properly. I've followed the directions and it still won't work. It's not showing me anything for the last three days which is really discouraging when I was really excited for a fitbit and being able to track my goals. At this point it was a waste of $150.
I can't believe they took away all of the challenges. That is literally the only thing I liked about the app & what kept me motivated & connected with the community. I have not been on the app or spoken to any of my fitbit friends since the challenges disappeared. App freezes all the time. It totally sucks & is not worth the premium cost. If I could give it a 0 I would. Leaving fitbit the min this watch breaks (& we all know it will). There is nothing appealing about the app. I miss my community
"new graphs are terrible & limit how you interact with your data. regularly refuses to sync. screens have permanent ads for premium. I've started using the food tracker and it's so clumsy. barcode reader often doesn't recognize or gets it completely wrong. database in general is low quality. can't save meals/recipes. ""recent"" tab has my common foods mixed with stuff I haven't eaten in years. it's all bad enough I'm considering moving to iOS to use apple watch. bf switched and is very satisfied."
"Premium renewal cheated me. They hide the subscription renewal. They included it free for a year as a, ""sorry we almost caught your wrist on fire"" compensation. I had updated my email on the account but they emailed renewal reminders to the old address where I didn't see them. If I look in my subscriptions list, Fitbit isn't there on either account. So I was blindsided for 80$ and they won't credit it back 3 hours after the order processed."
"They removed some of the best parts of the app. They removed all the fun challenges you can do with friends or family. I canceled my premium subscription and will be purchasing a Samsung watch for my next upgrade. There are better health tracking devices out there. The main reasons I even had a fitbit was because of the app and the ability to do fun challenges with my mom. That's gone now. Thanks, google!"
"NOT WORKING ANYMORE! used to sync no problem. Now it seems every 4 days or so I have to Uninstall and reinstall. I try every step I the fix it troubleshooting and nothing makes it work and sync except reinstalling it. VERY FRUSTRATING. I have a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, that I only just bought last fall 2022. Why is this happening? AND NOW IT WILL NOT SYNC THRU BLUETOOTH. So its just an expensive bracelet at this point."
"The app works fine for me, my problem is it takes too long to sync . I have the versa light and it has a orange box around the perimeter of this screen. And it is very annoying and frustrating, because you can not see some of the data sometimes. I would definitely recommend something like Samsung or apple .do not buy."
Would have been 5 Stars for oas long as the product was around. I have owned multiple watches for years. I use to Love my fitbit and encouraged others to get one. Now with the changes to say I dislike it is an understatement! Being in groups with friends and family motivated me. Such a huge disappointment with the changes. Biggest mistake ever merging with Google!
"The app drains my battery too much. I logged out yesterday to conserve battery, which worked quite well. However, the app now says it hasn't been synced for a week, when it was synced less than 24 hours ago. It wiped the last week's data. An incredibly poor app."
"I've been using this app and the device for years, I'm very active in the app. Incredibly disappointed in the new graphs you are using. It might look prettier but it has taken away data that I heavily relied on. I'm no longer able to view weekly totals in the graphs, and no longer able to scroll the chart. This is not an improvement. There are numerous long standing bugs that still go unfixed. There is no S0S or live tracking feature."
"Fitbit would be great if it weren't riddled with bugs. One, it double-logs your steps. If you run on a treadmill and then log your run, it will add a few hundred steps automatically, skewing your stats. Two, manually entering your workout is an absolute nightmare. Have fun filling the same field out multiple times because it keeps randomly clearing them when you hit save. I donât know if this is planned obsolescence or a cut QA department, but this app is basically useless."
Seems the corporation is more interested in tracking or personal data and habits to sell to advertisers than they are in providing a product we like and can use. I would NOT recommend this product. It doesn't even work as a watch when you can't set the time. Remove the need for us to be online to sync. Go back to letting us just connect with blue tooth. I'll be looking for something else that might function as advertised. Prior to the change it used to work great.
"This was on my Pixel Watch, and I don't recall ever signing up for a ""premium"" subscription. I'm usually really good about putting those on my calendar. Well, they billed me like $82 for an annual subscription in April, without telling me. I barely use the app, much less a ""premium"" version. I'm wondering if it was a Pixel Watch perk for a while, and now they are charging?? I don't remember even getting a notification for it. What a scam - I want my money back!!!"
"Terrible and unreliable syncing experience. It's a surprise when it works first try. Most days you have to refresh several times, restart Bluetooth, etc. Now some days it just doesn't work at all. It should not still be like this. Going back to a $30 Amazfit. It's much better on all fronts."
Heart rate graph only works 2 or 3 days out of the week. Other days shows nothing. Syncs take a couple tries everytime. Only works when it feels like it. Did I mention how this app sucks!! If my steps can sync why don't my heart rate data sync to this app? No support whatsoever. Glad I only have basic and not premium because I will not pay for an app that does not work properly.
"I got this for Mother's Day 2022. At first, everything was perfect! It synced quickly and every time! A couple of months ago it stopped syncing. I tried uninstalling/reinstalling the app, making sure location and Bluetooth were on and even rebooted my phone AND the watch! None of it worked!!! I have a love/hate relationship with technology...love it when it works, hate it when it doesn't! And right now, I hate this app AND the watch!!!"
"App was working fine... Until it wasn't. I can no longer pair the device or sync it to my phone. After talking with tech support, there apparently is an issue with connectivity between the charge and Samsung zflip 4. I'm dead in the water and was told to wait for the update. Thanks Fitbit. This doesn't inspire confidence and I'll be hesitant to purchase another fitbit product in the future."
"Fitbit will no longer sync with the app. I tried all the suggested fixes to no avail. Now I can't even use my fitbit as a watch. It is incredibly frustrating to spend so much money on the tracker only to have it be useless less than a year later. Not cool. I highly recommend using a different tracker if you want reliability. Also, the band attachment broke and I have to glue it to fix it. Can't use my fitbit swim tracker anymore, which was one of my favorite features."
Trash Panda to the max. If you have a Samsung fold or flip don't even bother. We both got them for Christmas and they won't sync once set up. One of them won't even connect to be set up. One is set up enough to use as a glorified watch. The other is a paperweight. Super disappointed. In the process of switching from all Apple devices. I used to have a fitbit forever ago and figured it would be an easy switch back. Probably going to look into the Garmin or Samsung watches.
"Can't sync as of Feb 6. Was working just fine, now it won't sync. I see all the data on my pixel watch, so I know it's gathering data, but it has stopped syncing to my phone. Everything is up to date, I've restarted both devices, I've disconnected and reconnected via Bluetooth. I'm not paying for a premium subscription that is not working. If not fixed soon I will be cancelling and moving to something else."
"App/Watch doesn't like Android 13. Nothing but trouble. Reset watch and it took 3 hours of trying to get it to pair. Reset app now it won't sync sleep but other stuff syncs. Can't get into gallery on app most of the time either. Absolute garbage. I've had a few FitBit watches over the last 10 years but if they can't keep up with the updates, I think it's time to drop them. It's clear they're not in a hurry to fix anything."
"First the app is not user friendly. Its very complicated and confusing. Finding what and where you want to be in the app is a challenge. Clock faces don't work properly, specifically the bitmoji. Trying to sync it and teleport is a nightmare that they've known about for years. Customer service is both a joke and a nightmare. You'll never get a helpful or intelligible answer. I've been with fitbit for nearly a decade and I'm beyond frustrated. Its a $store product for a premium price."
Bought a Charge 5 in August. It was great. Then it stopped syncing about 3 weeks ago. And it had the wrong date. After following all troubleshooting steps I decided to clear the data to see if that helped. It didn't and now it's useless because it won't connect. I just have the setup screen which eventually times out and goes dark. Do better.
Such a waste of time not being able to add a workout that didn't sync. It won't auto sync any workouts and it always says zero workouts for the day. I've tried everything to troubleshoot the issue and it doesn't work. I have a charge 5 and the fitbit app is a huge disappointment. It tracks everything except my workouts and the only thing I really need. App is useless if it can't do that. ZERO STARS.
"My sense will not sync with the app, it is always disconnected from my phone and it won't reconnect when I try to force it. I've tried everything from turning off Bluetooth to restarting my sense. Nothing works. This has been going on for over a month. I'm tired of all the problems Fitbit has been having since merging with Google. I'm moving on to a different brand."
I had fitbit devices for many years and i have been very happy. The last few months it has been a disaster. Not sure what development has been doing but I have been trying to sync the device with the app and it does not work. My mom device isn't working either. I've done everything fitbit says...better get this working or I will be switching.
"Since I got my Fitbit and started using the app, my phone that I've only had for a few weeks has lagged dramatically. It lags so much that when it rings, the call will go to voicemail before the screen comes up to answer it. I have to disable Bluetooth if I'm expecting a call. Which kind of defeats the purpose of a phone. I've had issues with the app with every Fitbit I have owned, but it gets worse every time."
"Just bought a new fitbit inspire 3. Couldn't tell you how it works since it won't sync to the app. Read reviews that this has apparently been a problem for alot of people for months and has not been fixed. It's just a screen that keeps flashing to sync to my phone. No steps, no time, no nothing. So I'm pretty upset and returning it. Could have been a cool device. Guess I'll never know."
Not even updated since November 2022? This is something that needs attention now. Fitbit products are not inexpensive. And the app to run them is not even updated to work with them. My charge 4 has not been able to be synced with the app in months. I give up. I tried absolutely everything. It will not get off the download app screen nor pair up with the app. WORTHLESS! I'm getting a new tracker and you can bet it won't be a fitbit.
"There has been a recent, wide-spread issue with getting your device to sync with your phone. I have spoken with customer support multiple times & just now, I was assured the issue is fixed, & I just need to troubleshoot again. It didn't work. According to the app, there are no updates to install, & my phone is compatible with my device. Even before this issue, the app is not great, & working with customer service is beyond infuriating. Both the device & membership are a massive waste of money"
"Can't keep up with technology! It's no longer syncing with my Samsung Fold 4. I bought a new fit bit thinking it was old, nope. It's the software. I texted with chatted Fitbit to see if i could get help syncing. If you have a Samsung fold 3/4, your lux will no longer sync. There is no eta for a fix. I don't need or want the fancy notifications or the large screen. I hope they fix the issue with the lux syncing to fold 3/4. I am disappointed in Fitbit, I thought it was more advanced."
"Out of nowhere the app has decided that it can't pair w/ my fitbit. This has been going on for a couple of weeks now. I've never had an issue before. Bluetooth comes up w/ an alert saying that this device needs an app to run. I have the app, I've had it for a few years. The app says I need to pair the device w/ the phone & it is already paired. There is no current update for the app in the app store. What's the deal fitbit?!"
"Just got this, Samsung flip phone Thanksgiving. My daughter gave me a fitbit. It is beautiful! I am unable to sync it to my phone. It tells me to wait for it to connect to my wifi. I've waited most of the day and have even rebooted afew times. I've also turned my wifi off and on a few times. Reading all your feedback does not look good. Please fix this glitch!"
"The app was shoddy and not intuitive from the get go. Not to mention, FitBit Pay is slowly losing even the little traction it had. Now I've lost the ability to sync on my Samsung Z Flip 4 and after removing the watch, can't even readd it. If you're going to completely give up on people that purchased your product pre-Google acquisition, at least give them their money back. I planned to wear this thing for years, and now it's a glorified heart rate meter (""tracker"" implies an app that works)."
"""To sync reliably, let Fitbit link to Flex"". After several years using the flex, one day after charging over night i get this message. I have reinstalled the app and tried to connect via bluetooth many times and it will not connect. I have tried all the suggestions and followed all the installation instructions and it will not connect. It should not be this hard. I have replaced with a new flex in the past and they have connected with no problem. This one charges ok ."
"Used fitbit for years no problem, now all of a sudden devices won't connect to the app. Called customer service all they could tell me in the end after all the troubleshooting was there was nothing they could do and they sent me a code for 35% off my next purchase. No thanks. I have 3 devices that will not connect...it is not the device it seems to be the app itself."
"Update: I now can't even sync the app with my fitbit. Since the Android 13 update my phone campy connect. I've tried all the troubleshooting; I'm just stuck waiting until the update the app. Apparently, this is a problem that affects the Samsung Fold and Flip. Between the Charge 5 and the July 2022 app update, I'm seriously considering jumping ship. I used to be able to tap the graphs to enlarge them and evaluate data - more they are just useless and hard to read."
"All the metrics disappeared. Until this morning the dashboard would show a step count as well as miles covered, flights of stairs, active minutes and calories burned. Now it only shows calories and there seems to be no way to get the other metrics back. Irritated doesn't even begin to cover it. I've been a Fitbit user for years but if this is how the app will be going forward, I'll be switching brands."
"Syncing doesn't work for my Google Pixel watch. Fitbit has really screwed up. It's constantly not syncing, and I bought my watch because the fitbit feature was supposed to be a big deal for the watch. It doesn't matter how many times I uninstall it, restart it, and log in and out, it will still decide not to count your steps after a while. I'm so freaking frustrated."
"My kids got ace3 watches for Christmas. I could not get them to connect to my phones, it would get the code and everything seemed to be good but then it wouldn't finish the connection process and say the Bluetooth needed to be on. It was and still saw the device. There is an issue syncing with the current software. Had to connect to my wife's iPhone update the firmware, then remove it from the account, remove the user data. Then it synced properly. I am work with electronics and this was awfull."
Bluetooth doesn't stay connected. My phone connects to versa 3 controls through Bluetooth then just sporadically loses connection. When the app was connected it could not control any app like Spotify through the Fitbit app or the smartwatch. All permissions are on everything is on and granted. Smartwatch is worthless if the program doesn't work. I've had the watch for about a year and it's always been like this. It's worthless.
"I have a Samsung flip4. My luxe stopped syncing in November 2022. I troubleshooted with the app support, but nothing worked. I bought myself a new Charge 5 for Christmas. It connected but then said it needs a firmware update and won't sync. I unpaired and tried to repair because it would not update, but it will not connect again. It's the same Connecting screen that ultimately times out. I have had fitbit products loyally for many years and this is my first major issue- it is the app!"
"I love my charge 5 but I hate the changes Fitbit made to the sleep monitoring during this last update, it doesn't make it easier to use and it lost or didn't record my data because of the changes. Please change it back. It also sucks that things that were free are now only available if you pay for the premium package. I will never pay for anything that was a free service, I would understand if it was a trial offer but it wasn't."
"I am only giving Fitbit one star because they are such a large company with so many users, I would think that they could invest in more time and effort with their app. I've had their app for about 8 years. And have used it with different Fitbit products as I've replaced them when they wear out. The app is very clunky and often spins without providing information. At times, I have to completely turn my phone off and then on again in order to get the app to work."
App used to be good.... you can no longer track a run on a treadmill. Even with app set to detect at 10 minutes it does not. I manually enter my time and distance and then app tells me the almost half distance it think I ran. So I cannot get accurate stats. Disappointing! And customer service is very lacking! Don't think you can contact them through here because you can't either. There is absolutely no help and their app does not work properly. I have never seen such a horrible company.
"This app used to be great. The last couple years its become laggy and freezes often. Now Fitbit/Google has announced that they are doing away with the one feature that keeps many users on the platform. They're getting rid of all the challenges. Those challenges are the best part of the app, literally the only reason I still use a fitbit instead of a Samsung or Garmin"
"Same situation as Ryan (Z-flip/update/won't sync), my the app was working great, and I was really enjoying the sleep tracking and other features. My last sync with the app was 07 Dec, and then there was a Samsung software ""Software updated to F71 1USQU3EVK3 December 8, 2022"" and it ceased to sync ever since. I've gone through every trouble shooter except the factory reset b/c I don't want to lose my data, but I'm not sure how long the charge 4 keeps data before it overwrites it. Waiting game?"
App is not user friendly. I can't seem to get any apps paired or permissions granted. I have had my tech friends try to help but to no avail. Not to mention it is painfully difficult to navigate I quit using the watch for a long time and now that I put it back on i am reminded it is essentially an expensive step and heart rate tracker. It's a fine want rendered useless by the app.
"Band is a brick for days with every Android update. It does NOT get fixed promptly. App has a broad functionality, like food logging, that other brands with more bells and whistles lack. Good app for weight if you don't mind frequent, lengthy inability to sync to phone. Update: over a week later and still no software fix. I had to downgrade to one star because that's just awful. I'm buying a Garmin watch."
"No dark mode. Constant annoying pressure popups. Terribly worded interface ""Goal reached. We'll drink to that."" Non-passive writing. Less workout features than Google Fit. Sleep study functionally inaccurate. Does not properly communicate with Google Fit. Using a Google Pixel 7 Pro with a Google Pixel Watch both running the latest versions, and I've reset both devices to make sure there's nothing wrong. Needs serious improvement. Not worth any money at all."
Sleep tracking is glitchy. When I sync most times the sleep doesn't sync properly. I'll see the time on the main screen but not on the sleep log. Also won't show the sleep score on face of watch. Recently phone calls and messages have stopped coming through the watch. Can't seem to fix this issue. I've issues nonstop with Fitbit regardless of the watch. Kind of getting sick of it and ready to dump them overall.
This app is not working right anymore. It's not tracking flights of stairs anymore and it doesn't record auto activities. I snowshoed for over an hour today and it wasn't recognised as exercise. Also I am not able to set a weight loss goal and have it tracked on the main screen. It just says You Did It! This update is garbage.
The device and app quality have gone down the drain over the last year. First my sense stopped working with no damage whatsoever. Now I have a sense 2 and it randomly disconnects from the app and won't sync despite all troubleshooting measures. Same thing used to happen with the Sense after the first year. Used to recommend fitbit to people. Won't make that mistake again nor will I be buying myself.
"Issues with sync and data transfer, I've had this versa 3 for a long while. And suddenly I'm having issues with sleep reports and syncing data. I had a red x after a 15 min rebooting loop meltdown that the versa 3 did. Was rebooting itself in a loop for 15 min. Wouldn't stop no matter what I did. Then after it decided to stop it had a red x I had to delete app and unlink Bluetooth and reset the whole device. What's going on? Another one of Google's half finished projects? I hope not."
"The app disconnects from the fitbit device all the time, and it can't be reconnected unless you plug in your fitbit to the wall, very inconvenient in the middle of a trail run. NO OTHER BLUETOOTH DEVICE REQUIRES THIS, just fitbit, it's like they're deliberately discouraging outdoor fitness. Also, the fitbit trackers themselves only last a few months, and fitbit doesn't give refunds for their overpriced and cheaply built tracker. Tech support is useless unless you can plug in your device."
"Drains my phone's battery very quickly even when I turn bluetooth off. Found out that it uses location data constantly and wants to run in the background. The app is just too instrusive and I plan on uninstalling it. My fitbit will still count my steps, monitor my heart beat and tell time. I don't need an app communicating with the ""mother ship""."
"This is my 4th fitbit. I have liked them until now. Recent upgrades degraded functionality I liked. I paid for what was the premium model and the premium subscription. However, one of the main reasons I bought it was to track heartrate for targeted heartrate workouts. The device is incredibly inaccurate at higher heartbeats. The error is often as high as 70%. I've tried all recommendations. Effectively useless for my intended purposes. This bro is disappointed!"
Update: It's been well over a month with no connection. Both app and phone updated. Not even good as a watch. Canceled my subscription and I'm moving on. FITBIT was great before merging with Google. Now I have more problems than it's worth. Latest issue is the Charge 5 not synching with my Samsung flip. I called Fitbit's customer support and was told it's a known issue and an update would be pushed out in 2 weeks. It has been over 2 weeks now and all I have is a watch. When will this be fixed?
Don't know when it started but for at least 2 months I have not been able to sync my Luxe with my Samsung Fold 4. I have reset both phone and fitbit with no avail. I deleted the device from the fitbit app now I can not reconnect it to the app now. There is no support for it and no ETA for a fix. Google needs to get there act together. Have had a fitbit for 6 years and this is my 4 fitbit. Things were a lot better when it was just Fitbit and not part of Google eco system.
"1/28/23 Google is driving Fitbit into the ground. 7/28/2022 the new update made more problems, didn't fix old ones. New phone still syncing problems. The syncing only works if I turn off iphone Bluetooth. 5/24/2020 -->It has syncing problems. I would not recommend getting a Fitbit. <1 year the band broke. A few firmware updates, still syncing problems. Why purchase the expense plan when it doesn't work well to begin with. 3 stars to 2. 3 months and still syncing problems with my Samsung C7 Pro."
"My Fitbit won't sync to Bluetooth hardly ever after the last few updates. Sometimes it does it right away but at least once a month it won't re-sync without having to troubleshoot. And customer service has gone downhill. Lately, they just blame my phone. I have one of the newest models. The Bluetooth is ALWAYS giving me issues but only with my watch nothing else."
"I genuinely hate this new ad system. Half the time ads never show up so I can't read a chapter. Another portion of the time I watch an ad to completion only to miss hitting the tiny X which sends me somewhere else, and then that will make me have to sit through an ad again for the cycle to continue. I had to watch an ad several times before I gave up trying to read the chapter."
"This app has gone downhill. The daily pass system has ruined it. It makes it near impossible to enjoy many series, and I've moved to others apps. I will use this until the ongoing series I'm reading have concluded, but I'm no longer starting new series or reading old series. I recomend manta. They have a daily pass as well, BUT you can purchase a subscription for $4 a month for unlimited reading instead. Far more economical than webtoon's daily or fast pass system."
Comics themselves are great and there are many likable titles. The app is awful though. Crashes after reading one chapter and after that it can take hours or days for me to even get in again. The search function is pretty much pointless and finding anything that wasn't or isn't featured is extremely difficult. You can't search artists' names to see their other works and over all the interface and layout of the entire app is just confusing at times.
"I love this app, but ever since the most recent updates it freezes and crashes every two or three comics. It also causes my phone to overheat. I've read online that they're wanting to add a coin system which makes me wonder that is the reason the app is now having issues. The screenshot thing is annoying, but not a game breaker. I just want to be able to read my favorite stories without it crashing."
"The introduction of ""Daily Pass"" ruined it. Since I have never once had the ability to view any ""Fast Pass"" or ""Daily Pass"" (for free or paid for with coins) nor have I ever been presented with an ability to buy coins it means that all comics, once completed, become impossible to view ever again. and even if I find some way to pay for them, it's locked to viewing on the app even after paying for it. If they want to sell completed comics, great! but locking it behind a buggy app? No way. It's even worse for those of us who helped an artist complete it through patreon support. Add in the issue of popup ads with recent updates that come up on every page view and the app experience is just horrible compared to PC but, again, since I can never view what is completed on PC regardless of my willingness to pay for it or not, it's as if the entire series was deleted. I can't even view or edit my own comments on the completed comics anymore! but I still get notiifcations for them, which is just so stupid. The issue of never being able to view fast pass never bothered me because I never cared about reading ahead, but the issue of never being able to access daily pass DOES bother me because it means I will NEVER be able to read comics I loved and supported ever again."
"I've been on this app for awhile, and it's really been the best part of my days. Relaxing and reading at my own pace. I found lots of completed stories I absolutely loved and would occasionally go back and re-read. Now they have the ""daily pass"" which completely limits that. It's absolutely freaking trash. Bad enough you have to wait for weekly updates on most comics (if you're even that lucky) as they are still being made, but now on completely, fully, finished ones??! BULLCRAP."
"The app has been great (except for the daily pass) up until the past few months. Since about January or February, when I got my new phone, I haven't been getting any notifications from this app. I checked on the app and on my phone's settings, and all of the notifications are turned on, but I never get any. This is really annoying because canvas webtoons don't have a schedule they update on, so I often miss the updates and only realize they updated a long while later."
"It's a nice app, but I'm here to vent about the ads. The stories are great and easy to access. I love the format. But why did I rate this with one star? Those ads. I am NOT INTERESTED in ""My Freaking Romance"" and the ads are not helping. There are ads about people reviewing/acting it out & all of that jazz, but I don't want to see any of it. I don't know what I searched to make YouTube think I want this or how much money you're paying for advertising, but the ads are repetitive and pure cringe."
"Do not update to the newest version... Don't get me wrong, it is a great app with some truely amazing content. However, the recent introduction of the secure flag that disables the ability to take screenshots when viewing a ""Webtoon"" is just an annoying UX decision to spring on users without warning/notice. (especially when just viewing it on a website renders that all obsolete)"
"I used to enjoy this app until they added the daily pass. I understand they want to make money and hopefully some of it goes to the content creators, but the daily pass seems to be overreaching a bit. I would rather endure ads or pay a monthly subscription than deal with their pass systems. It's a bit buggy and crashes fairly often, so hopefully that can be sorted that out as well."
"Lots of good comics on the app, but it crashes constantly. You cant even get through a whole chapter without at least one crash, and you have to start the chapter over every time it crashes. Intolerable. Seriously, this can't be that hard of a glitch to fix, but the developer seems to have no interest in implementing one."
"this app has great stories, and its easy to use. but, WEBTOONS keeps crashing at random times, and i keep finding glitched parts of a comic that is related to a completely different series. between that and crashing, i spend a long time waiting for the app to load after restart. this started to happen shortly after this last update. i hope someone notices this review and can fix the app. thx."
"Don't get me wrong, this app is amazing and I've been using it for 3-5 years, but I just saw the daily pass and that is the worst idea I've ever heard of! Webtoons that have been finished for YEARS are now limiting you with the bs daily pass. I can't even go into full detail how bad the system is. Btw their coin system sucks, fast pass is great and all but don't spend money till the bugs are fixed. I won 15 coins from the September contest and never spent them only for them to dissappear."
"The Daily Pass is ABSURD. I would rather pay a flat fee for a comic than the ridiculous fee per chapter. I'm all for supporting the app and the artists, but I can get hardcover books for a cheaper price than what I'd have to pay to read a finished comic in a timely manner. Even the fast passes are a bit much in my opinion. I've decided to just finish the last few series I've started and then I will be done with Webtoon. It's a shame, because this started out as a great app."
"[Update] Over a year later and still no improvement in the issues I listed. How can they keep ignoring these problems? Dropping to 1 star until they fix. [Jan 2020]. Good content, but the user interface is horrible. There's NO quick way to figure out when there's new content. And, if you want to have the app on two different devices, there's no syncing. Seriously Webtoon, a few basic changes would make this app 10 times easier to use..."
I've used it for 6 years. It was amazing back then but now everything you have to pay for. I didn't mind the fast pass- I can wait but the daily pass is so annoying. Series I've read a long time ago that I want to finish- now I cant. It was free when back when I started webtoon. Now I have to wait everyday to unlock one episode I've read before just to remember what was going on. So annoyed with that
"My account was suddenly deleted. I had not used webtoon in a while as i like to 'save up' my chapters and read a bunch all at once. When I accessed the app, it kept telling me it couldn't connect to the internet (my wifi and data were working fine with other apps). I uninstalled, then reinstalled, and suddenly could no longer log into my account. Upon trying to log in (with gmail), the app created a new account with my email, but with none of my favorites or any of my coins. Very unhappy."
"webtoon was better when reading the chapters was free, now it requires coins for unlocked episodes & that sucks. I've been using this app for a long time to read a lot of my favorite webtoons I guess I won't be using it anymore. I'm not sure what changed that they added the unlock system but it honestly disappointed me so much. I've been using this app for more than 2 years."
"It keeps saying my email address isn't registered when I've had an account for a while. When I go to make a new account, it tells me that the account is already registered. When I login through Google, none of my subscriptions show in the subscription section. When I do everything online, I don't have this problem at all. I login without an issue and my subscriptions are all there. These app issues occur no matter what phone I am using (I have tried multiple times for about a year to use it)."
"I've been on webtoon since its release. It has come a long way and I have loved being a part of supporting webtoon and reading alot of amazing story's. Sadly, its gone down hill recently. In the last couple of years there has been the addition of ads and coins, and fast pass. Which was ok, it was a good way for authors to get paid. But now the new daily pass system awful. Old ones cant be binge read, wait a week for new ones, then use a pass and or money to read. Its better to read online now."
"So I love webtoon, but the most recent update has made it horrible. It crashes in me constantly and it heats up my phone a lot. And its not just my phone, my friends phone is having the same issues with it. I have the note 9 and she has the s9. We should not be having these issues and I never had them before the update. But it worries me how hot my phone is getting and it is only when I use this app. Please fix so we can go on enjoying the webtoons we love!"
"A great app, good stories, fun events. I remember the good old days when you could read a webtoon without having to use daily passes and I was hooked, loved that feature and I would spend lots of time reading these wonderful stories. Webtoon has made it so you can read one chapter a day which is extremely frustrating and makes me spend less and less time in the app cause I have no motivation to read unless I can continue reading and not stop after one short chapter."
"I used to love this app to read some of my favorite series, but their recent update with their coin system has ruined the experience for me. It used to be that coins were used to unlock early access to chapters for ongoing series. That was something I had no problem with. But now, I log in to revisit a comic I've already read and it's locked behind a paywall unless I use a ""daily pass"" or purchase coins to read something that was free to access a year ago."
"fast pass. buy coins.. you ruined a perfectly good app. And it hasn't gotten any better logged back in after taking a break so the comics could progress a bit and now I have to buy coins to re-read the comics. Really. This app used to be something I looked forward to using. Now after almost 2 years of continuously decreasing quality, I dread the thought of opening it. Never know what is going to be ruined next."
"I've had webtoons for about 5 years. It was always one of the first apps I'd download on my new devices. I would binge read daily. Unfortunately, due to the daily pass thing i can no longer keep up with the comics I would reread. I guess my brain isn't wired to be able to read multiple stories at a time one episode at a time.. i miss the comics i was reading and the creators i followed but the daily pass is just too frustrating to me.. i hope they fix it but taking the 2 week expiration off.."
"*edit, 04/27/20* I uninstalled and reinstalled the app as recommended in the help section and now I don't have access to my account. I've spent a lot of money on this app and have been a user for years. Thanks a lot. FIX YOUR APP. Whatever you did this past update has caused the app to glitch and crash, and it makes it difficult to read one chapter smoothly all the way through. I've had an occasional crash on the app, but this is happening every time I try to read something now. FIX. IT."
"Edit (7/8/21): I gave it some time and then redownloaded the app to see if Webtoons had gotten better at all. No it has not. I don't think I will be touching this app again for a long time, if ever. I'm still incredibly disappointed by the disaster that is the Daily Pass and how a lot of old webtoons that used to be fully free are now locked behind it for the majority of their chapters. I cannot approve their ""business"" model, and it seems many others can't either. Wish I could give 0 stars."
"This isn't a review of the various stories, almost all of them have been good. But what makes me give Webtoon a 1 star review is the fact that you can't read a series in its entirety. The Sweet Home Netflix adaptation was good, and I wanted to see how it held up compared to the source material. I'm not paying money just to read a few pages of a great story. Put an ad every few chapters or something, but don't make us buy microtransactions just to enjoy the app."
"Been using webtoon for a long time now, but their pop-ups upon launching the app are getting infuriating. It used to be one pop-up that, if I told it ""don't show me this again"", I wouldn't see it again. Now? Not only have the number of pop-ups increased, THEY KEEP COMING BACK. I've gotten the same FIVE pop-ups all at once upon opening the app on several occasions. That's me tapping ""Don't show me again"" 5x just to get to the toons. Apparently ""don't show me again"" is just a suggestion now."
Love the app. I use it daily. BUT with this daily check in challenge I'm getting really frustrated. For some reason the app has reset my progress numerous times and all of my daily check ins have been lost. I have emailed the developers twice regarding this issue to no avail. Please fix this. Other than that issue I can't complain about the app. I love it and that's why this issue is so upsetting. I spend real money on this app and was finally excited to get a reward for free.
Daily Pass is the Absolute Worst for Returning Users. I used webtoon when it originally came out. I loved it. I have no problems buying coins for fast pass on ongoing series. I took a break for a year & when I came back all my series that completed are locked. I can't read it unless I buy $100+ worth of coins. I hate the one free episode a day with daily pass when a series has 500 chapters. It's unfeasable & you're better off pirating. All chapters should unlock temporarily for a small fee.
"Lately it seems like every single completed story worth reading is immediately moved to the ""Daily Pass"" thing. You can hardly read ANYTHING worth while unless you pay for every episode, or wait a week for something that takes less than 2 minutes to read. It's also been glitching out with the ""watch an ad to view the next episode!"" Thing resulting in me having to watch 2-3 ads just to read one chapter. This app has SEVERELY gone down in quality over the past few years. Extremely disappointed."
"Honestly, I used to love this app. So many options to choose from, I could read all day to my hearts content. Then, it all changed, fast pass....I get to read 2 chapters if that. I've decided to Uninstall simply because I'm not someone who can read a chapter or two a day. It's become a cash grab over the years and unfortunately as an adult I don't have money to waste on unlocking individual chapters at a time ð but I suppose seeing these amazing works was great while it lasted â¡"
"The app itself is ok, my issue is entirely with the account settings. I got a new phone, and tried to log in, however it said wrong password or email. I know for a fact this is the right email, because my entire mail is full of spam from it. It won't let me change my password, when I try, it sends me to the help site. The help site has no useful information what's so ever. I can't create a new account either because I already have one. I think it's better using other social media than to deal."
"I haven't used the app long, but this ""daily pass"" and ""3 coins"" requirement for each episode is ridiculous. Completely ruins my experience. There is a much better way to have people pay for content than this. Essentially, each chapter is $0.30. But some chapters are really short. If you wanted to finish a whole story within a day or two (like Noblesse for example), it could easily cost you over $140 if you are willing to pay. Most people with common sense are not."
"it would be a good app if you could actually read the webcomics! constantly crashes for no reason, doesnt give any kind of indication. just closes and you have to figure out where you left off. even if I download the comics it will just tell me ""click to load"" but never actually does. If you read for more than a few minutes the whole app starts to lag and even makes me phone lag until I close and re open the app"
"The creators on this app are so talented and the stories they produce are what keeps me coming back. What makes me hate using the app is that it crashes, closes the chapter I'm reading, and I have to restart that chapter. Every. Single. Time i try reading a webtoon. Not to mention it makes my phone extremely hot & drains battery while no other app I run on high settings does that."
"I have been a huge fan of webtoon, it was an amazing free service where I could read amazing comics to pass the time and get into a story with the convenience of my phone. I was hoping to binge some comics I read years back but now its added a pass and coin system. Which stops me from enjoying the once free service I loved. I wouldnt mind ads being in place on ever other page or so instead of blocking the series completely unless I pay or use a pass."
"I have no serious problems with the app itself, but I recently uninstalled because I didn't really hold interest in it anymore. However, no matter how many times I unsubscribe from their irritating emails, I always end up somehow getting more. I've unsubscribed at least 6 times now, but the emails still wont stop. I even redownloaded the app, undid notifications and emails, and then uninstalled, yet I continue to get these stupid messages. I want it to stop! I'm beyond frustrated at this. Stop."
"I don't mind that the app crashes all the time however I've had no other choice but to leave a review since attempting to contact customer service is impossible. I love all the comics on this app, yet that is because of all the talented creators within the app. Webtoon themselves charged my account twice and I have no coins to account for. I used a different payment method the third time and it worked. However I noticed the additional $20 charge to my account. I was ripped off so be careful."
"I uninstalled Webtoon for a while on my phone, ao I could do other stuff. While it was uninstalled, I still got e-mails letting me know when my favourite Webtoons updated. So then I had a lot more space on my phone, and I decided to install it again to catch up on all the reading I didn't have time for. I logged in with my old account, and it didn't save any of my subscriptions, or which episodes I had even read. It completley lost everything in my accout, and didn't put it back in."
PLEASE STOP WITH THE POP UPS!!!!!!!!!! D: I understand that you want me to know where I'm at in the canvas game but omg is it annoying. A little snack bar would be fine or having a space for games like that the 'my' tab! You could have a whole tab for games and even have people get notified about new ones when a game isn't going on! But pleassssseeeeeeeeee stop it's so annoying if you are reading a whole series - especially if it's a short comic you see the pop up every 30 seconds.
"I really love this app. But I have been facing a persistent problem since a very long time, that is I cannot access to any events that grant coins because it shows that I apparently have a ""network problem"" and ""unable to connect"" when I don't. Every other app in my phone works perfectly and never shows the network problem. Even though I have contacted the customer care several times before but the problem still persists till now. I'm having a really hard time the cause coins do matter a lot."

"I used to love this app. EVERYDAY I came onto read one thing. Then they introduced coins. I was a big fan as a writer myself supporting the authors of my favourite works was amazing. GOH, TOG, Unordinary, and a buck load more. I loved reading all of them. Then the series finished. The majority of them I read. GOH the recent joiner of this. And before rereading them was a pleasure. But in the last year or two rereading has become a pain. Fast passes coin increase. Reread coins. ð"
This one star is heee because I really don't like the green adds that pop up from the bottom of the screen. It was fine for a bit but eventually having to leave the episode and come back to it to like it is annoying. It makes me not want to like the episodes but then it hurts the artists not you so I'm stuck.
"This app used to be amazing! You could tolerate all of the things that you couldn't access without paying. But now, they have added this daily pass thing. It is ridiculous! You can't even read completed series anymore. They have added it to new series as well. I guess, in the end, all apps get too greedy and turn into a cash grab. Maybe im overreacting? It's extremely frustrating."
"It was very good, but it has lost a lot of quality over the last few years. when the platform started to offer more than 3 early access chapters, the translation service declined a lot. in Korean titles, the platform offers chapters released more than a month late as if it were a recent chapter, and they sell this as early access. I want to support authors, but also don't want to be scammed into buying old chapters."
"This app used to be amazing, but now it's blocked by a paywall on every individual comic. I hate that it turned out this way. Can't recommend this site anymore and I feel like the content on it is lost to the ads. Unless you have money, don't bother with this one."
"Not enough ways to earn coins, but they're slowly integrating coins into every series that is worth reading. They're being a very greedy company, unfortunately it's more worth it to read unofficial translations at this point and it's probably going to get worse. The Korean version of the app has many ways to earn coins, webtoon literally just wants our money and will offer nothing in return. Webtoon used to be great. Used to be."
"Sometimes after an update you lose all your subscriptions and comics, can't sync with a new device while the website works flawlessly. Search function is not really working, if I search ""Loving Reaper"" I can't find anything. Which sucks because since there is no sync option I can't find my old comics. I'll uninstall this application and rather use the website."
"No option for multiple devices for purchased content. Hiking prices. While the app isn't bad otherwise, the degree of greed has become very apparent and I only expect it to get worse unless enough users vote with their reviews and wallets. I will be suspending my purchases until at least one additional device is supported in some way or they roll back the prices."
Changing my five star because this app is becoming more and more money hungry over the years. You can't just reread old ones anymore they have to be rebooted into daily pass.you already have people paying to read ahead why are you dropping new series as daily pass. This app is turning into tapas and it breaks my heart. I've been using it since it dropped USA and I feel like my favorite app is slowing going downhill. IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE US PAY! PAY YOUR CREATORS BETTER!
"I used this app a lot in my teens, but recently when I tried to go back and finish a series I had put on hold, it was locked behind a pay wall, or you have to wait until 10pm the following day to continue reading. A lot of comics I read were short chapters, so having that format really screwed it up."
"Coins cost 30% more in the uk (starts at 99p (which is ~$1.30) here versus (~70-80p) 99Â¢ in the US). Doesn't transfer your read data across devices. Icr where I was in unordinary, and the only clue I have is that I commented on chapter 170 ""Can't wait for this to go downhill fast"" which ik I read a number of chapters beyond. If you ever want me to spend money on here, the app needs to improve drastically. Lost my account data."
"Had the exact same thing happened to me as the other reviews. But in my case. I have problem with the website as well. Last night I was reading ""surviving romance"" had no problem at that time. So I decided to download the app. But there's just loading and loading and reconnecting. It says bad connection. Even though I can use other apps easily. It's a such mood breaker. I was so happy and was going to give you 5 stars but I guess it can't be helped.. hope you devs work on updating.."
I dislike the daily pass system where you can only unlock one chapter a day for ungoing series. It becomes tedious to go and unlock one chapter per series every day instead of being able to let chapters accumulate and then sit down and read several at once. Then the last 3 chapters are locked behind paid purchase anyway. A number of the highly promoted comics are all variants of the same tired (romance) story while unique & thought-provoking stories get largely pushed to the bottom of the lists.
"I used to love webtoons and spend almost all of my time reading them. I've had a webtoons account since before 2016. In the last couple years it's been terrible. I used to be able to sit and read a comic for hours and hours and really get into it, but now they have daily passes where I can only read one episode a day. I used to pick and choose which one I would read and then go through them, but now I hardly go on due to feeling like they're limiting what I can read. There's so much more too..."
"I absolutely used to love this app. I have been using it for 2+ years now, but since the recent changes I will not continue to use the app for more than just weekly updates on Lore Olympus. I don't understand why they have changed the unlocked episode system. Used to when you unlocked an episode it was unlocked for good. I was recently going back through to reread one of my favorites (one which I had over 100 episodes unlocked). Only to discover that they had been locked all over again."
My first app long ago for reading manhaw & used to love it. BUT all the money I have spent on stories changed into one day reading after the story is finished. So even though I paid for a lot of chapters to re-read these stories I have to wait all over again. So not reading any new stories & finishing up the last so I can drop this app.
"it was a really great app until they started the daily pass series going and even stopped giving away coins as much, anyone wanting to read daily pass please beware that the last three episodes will never unlock for free. That is something they didn't mention exclusively before and now i can never know the ending to my favourite series. So disappointed honestly."
"The introduction of the daily pass system is why this is 2 stars. As soon as I see something is a daily pass comic, I unsubscribe and never touch it again. If they did a monthly sub fee like Manta, I'd happily do that instead. Oh, well; I feel bad for the authors. Edit: it is 1-star now because they unsubscribed me from a series I was reading to make it Daily Pass, even after I spent coins on Fast Pass. I would rather donate directly to authors than support this app anymore."
"App is good, but the devs don't actually care about problems with the UI and such. I've had problems with the app insisting I'm not subscribed to anything, daily pass for completed webcomics is ridiculous, and not being able to sort my webcomics by the days they update, which seems like a pretty obvious function. Beyond that, it's no better for creators. They often end up leaving due to the webtoon team actively lying to them."
"Actually horrible now. Translators paid $20-30 for a chapter no matter how dialog heavy. Making you wait a week or pay to read series that are already complete. Actual trash translations. Series behind months and sometimes years of where original is. Pay extra to ""read ahead"" of chapters already out for months. Do they not know how to run a business? Fan translation online does so much better. It's better to do that."
"While everything fine on my side the thing I hate the most are the daily pass on the completed series. While it may be for profit for the app or not, is damn annoying re-reading the chapters then havve to wait for one day to read only to get one chapter and the cycle repeat, honestly if you want to enforce this, atleast make it you can read up to 5 episodes because hell its a completed series and im not waiting like it was an episode that will arrive two days or so. NVM this daily pass is awful"
"There are some amazing stories on here, but after coins were introduced it went a little downhill for me. I don't at all hate that you can pay money to read chapters in advance, but to add daily pass (meaning you can read 1 or 2 chapters a day of a finished series) and not even make me able to finish a story because of a stupid paywall is making me really annoyed. So congratulations you can buy another star for 7 coins :)"
"I honestly find this apps translation quality to be terrible, I went on here to read ""official"" translations of some series that I like only to find garbage, the translations were awful and inconsistent. The people who did them clearly did not know proper grammar and it makes you question if they even know anything about the English language. You can find fan done translations that are a million times better than what they put on here."
"Absolutely HATE that when you try to pick the webtoon you were just reading and its daily pass if its unlock date has expired you cannot just exit from the chapter and be brought to all the chapters, so you have to go all the way to search, search the webtoon and click it to have access to all chapters. Also daily pass for ONGOING webtoons is a VERY bad feature Also increase on coin price on some of the webtoons is awful, 7? That basically means you're more likely to have uneven coins"
"I can't log into the app ): I previously used FB to log in, and now it won't even load. I have been a long time reader and quite a few coins locked in my account, am upset that all my progress and money has been lost."
It was good until the most recent update which cleared my recent read and subscribed list again. Which would have been tolerable if it weren't for the list of new personal data and device usage info requests. Such a shame.
I can't believe this is was changed a whole time! I though it's free to reading like on the past but now I came back and read again it's kinda disappointed because of my reading chapter on the past was too far often but need the reading daily pass after go on that episode! I want to past time to read cause im done a lot of my things like I wanted to read! I will no longer to read on this app if still not to change the policy! Id rather to read on other website with spam ads than paying each Epð§
"Comics are fine. Apps functionallity has gone down since update. The My tab always says I have no subscriptions to comics, when I do. It won't let me unsubscribe to comics I don't want to read anymore, and won't let me subscribe to comics I know I already subscribed too. Sometimes it will choose not to load but will act like it did. Whatever y'all did this update fix it please"
"I enjoy webtoon because it has many good webcomics, however recently I've noticed that they are putting a lot of series behind a paywall as ""daily pass"". Also, more concerning, is the lack of content/trigger warnings in regards to sensitive topics such as assault and suicide. Since creators are not the ones who decide whether a warning is added this fault can only be placed on webtoon. I am wary to read any drama because of PTSD and my mental health. Please fix this issue."
Webtoon has gone so far down hill. A lot of their series (not discover) encourage sexual assault and pedophilia. The new download system works poorly. It's very scummy that almost every new series is a daily pass and then the last three episodes still cost money and can't even be unlocked daily. I'm still shocked that they allowed sexual assault to be encouraged as a good thing in their stories.
"my friend recommended me to read 'Aegis Orta'. i read the first 15 chapters, it's great! i wanna know more! but on the 16th chapter, i figured that we need to use daily pass or pay 12 coins. how ridiculous is that? mind you, this series has a total of 287 chapters. minus the free first 15 chapters, it'd be 272. if i want to read it all at once, id have to spend $30 or IDR 465,000. if i choose not to spend, id have to wait 272 days! 9 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS! utterly ridiculous."
"Was an OG and daily pass ruined it. I buy coins sometimes for series by western artists. There are a lot of Korean ones that have been completed already and are put behind a daily pass pay wall. I read My ID is Gangam Beauty 4 years before webtoon added it. It's ridiculous. The pop up ads are insane, they stole my coins for a series I don't even read even though the notification made it seem like it would be the next episode in the one I was reading. Webtoon is just as bad as Tapas now. Ick."
Nothing new. Webtoon's just gettin' much much and muuucchh mooreee cleverer in monetizing everything. Even 4 a story that just ended in a while udah dikoinin! What a great idea!! And long story probs. I cant access to events that grant coins. Very nice. Thank you
"Your new update is glitches! I paid 31.64 for Coins and the app froze while I was buying them, so I exited... when I went back there were no coins and my purchase history was gone! I know I paid for them because I got a Google Play email confirmation! I tried emailing you to give me my coins but was rejected and told to talk to Google Play! However Google Play has a 48 hour policy and you didn't email me back for 4 days, which made it impossible for me to get a refund!!! I want my coins!!!"
"Honestly it's webtoon keeps shotting itself in the leg. Daily pass is an actual joke and trust me, no one is going to patiently wait for one chapter per day when they can do easily just get the chapters on illegal websites. This is reduces people who want to read new series Second of all, the fact that you can't even download daily pass series anymore. Like bffr, alot of people use to use webtoon just so they could read when they are offline but that's not a thing anymore either soo"
"Daily Pass ruined everything. I can only read my favorite story 1 episode per day. And each episode is only available to read for 2 weeks, after that I have to use another daily pass or buy it with coins. I rather read the story in another language even if I don't understand it."
I used this app daily until 9 months ago when the panels went blank and I cant read anything. After contacting customer support they said they will investigate it but have yet to reach back out to me. I am a paying customer and I love this app however if I am unable to use the app I cant enjoy it. If this problem didn't exist I would rate this app 5/5. Edit: I failed to mention that I did follow those instructions multiple times however nothing worked I had mentioned that to customer support.
"the dialogue between characters is painfully bad, everything here is written for children or extremely sensitive adults. the art is lazy and bland, almost interchangeable between artists. webtoons incentivizes artists to spam, that is, each chapter is like 5 sentences and between each, individual, panels, there is a bunch of blank space you have to scroll before getting to the next panel, everything is as stretched out as possible, and the story writing copied from other successful works."
"They decided to make the fast pass 7 coins on a bunch of series when they used to be 5. Where the 10$ bundle used to get you 21 chapters with the 8 bonus coins, now you get 15 chapters. Not only is this just pure greed, making it an arbitrary number like 7 so you have to buy more bundles which are only in multiples of 10, the authors of the webtoons got no say in it. You like this series? Pay more than you did before for no reason. Absolutely pathetic."
"Love the stories hate how my progress is never saved and I've had to restart multiple comics. It also pisses me off that comics I have been reading for years now have the daily pass, that was a stupid move, makes thise comics not worth reading anymore."
"This webtoon I used to enjoy using, ut now with these fast pass pay scheme is a rip off. Ontop you collect free coins via reading the episode and then they bloody expire them. Why r u expiring the coins. The coins should be there forever doesnt matter how many I collect. We earned through reading them and you benefited from it so you u bloody conning us. I don't even enjoy webtoon no more. Rip off"
"This app is a complete waste of time. Sure, there are some decent stories on here, but it's possible to read them elsewhere and not have to deal with this app. Be warned that if you try to make any negative comment in any way, you will have privileges revoked and a variety of other issues as well. It's suggestions are atrocious for stories, and the overall community is very toxic if you say anything that doesn't suit them. I have deleted this app and have been able to find things elsewhere."
"Between the coins and the passes for completed series and now passes for incomplete series, I'm really just starting to hate the platform. Stop paywalling people, at this point I'm tempted to give up on webtoons entirely"
Please add a Read Later list next to the Subscribe button! Sometimes I'll see a comic that looks good but I want to read it later.
"Leaving a 1 star because I clicked to unlock episode 105 of Midnight Poppyland, using coins I BOUGHT. Im on episode 104, click the next button ""would you like to unlock Poppyland episode 105 for 7 coins?"" Pops up and i hit accept. The episode that loaded AND unlocked was from a series I haven't even LOOKED at, let alone read, nor have I ever seen on my page. Its not even one in a genre I read. And Webtoons is refusing to make this APPARANT ERROR right. TAPAS IT IS."
"Been using this app for years, was talking to my wife on facebook messanger and the audio cut out, as soon as i closed the app the audio worked again. Why is the app trying to use my microphone? I checked the permissions of the app and it has camera permissions. Kinda sus."
"I am VERY DISAPPOINTED from this app,the problem is that the app isn't even loading it just shows ""no internet connection"" when I have a GOOD internet connection...Also I have installed and uninstalled it twice but same problem. Please fix this problem as soon as possible."
"Multiple pay walls and reading limits? Another manga/manwha app gone to the dumpster. Used to read all the time using this app, was willing even to pay coin to get early access to episodes, but I've gotta watch multiple lame app commercials just to read more than 3 chapters of a series? Bai bai thanks for the memories webtoon."
This app sucks so bad. Please bring the per coins per fast pass unlock back down to 5 and please make it so every way to get free coins is back to get 5 instead of 1 or 3. Im no longer giving my money to this app because I have other priorities.
"Webtoons is officially trash. This new pay system is so insulting and abusive to readers. And it's obviously an absolute cash grab. $15 only gets you so many coins, and the artists are lucky if they see penny's off of that. You could go to Manta for $5 a month and know that, not only will you have access to all content, but the service pays more to the content creators."
"I used to love using this app, but now it's a load of garbage. I have to spend money to read the other panels of the manga. That is not right it used to be free. Now I can't read comfortably anymore, thanks a lot."
I used to love this app but it's become too expensive. Even with the monthly subscription you can't finish a story you only get a few chapters in
"I can't use the promotion code that I bought from e-commerce (official). It said that I need to have version 2.4.4 to use promotion code. It's coins that I bought in Indonesia e-commerce (tokopedia), I tried to update this app but I'm still stuck in version 2.12.4. Hot to update it to 2.4.4? And how to use the code that I already bought to redeem it to coins?? Isn't suppose to be use in promotion code or somewhere else? I won't change the stars until someone from this apps help me"
Constantly placing ads where you accidentally press them so it starts opening all kinds of bad things on your phone.
"I accidentally closed the check-in pop-up and there was no way to re-open it whatsoever. I missed a day because of this. They used to run these events in the rolling banner, but it doesn't appear there anymore. They want us to check-in for 10 days to boot. This is ridiculous!! Put those events back in the rolling banner!! How am I supposed to check-in properly and check my progress otherwise?!"
the daily pass thing makes me really sad. especially on completed series. I leave them alone for a while so they can finish and I can read all at once but I can't with the daily pass. not without spending money ð blood thirsty company.
"I recently started to get an error when attempting to open a document with Word or Excel from the Dropbox app. The error message reads, ""To open this file, please update your Dropbox app"" and I can't open the file. But if I open Word or Excel and navigate to the same files, I am able to open them. I have the latest version of Dropbox. I even cleared cache, then deleted data, removed the app, and reinstalled it, but the behavior continues."
"Android app has become very unreliable re: the ability to open subfolders. Half the time I try to open a subfolder on a Chromebook, now, it ""wipes"" across like it is opening the folder, then dumps back to the same location, unable to reach a file i can reach on a PC. Other times it works (same file, same user). Even if the subfolder has only folders immediately below it. No error to explain the problem, just unable to drill down. Unreliable is useless."
Terrible. Used to be such great ux and not buggy but these days I can't use it to find the things I need cause it either fails to load the pictures and loads it from the top so I lose my place. Photos shown are not in actuate timeframes. The search function is pretty much useless cause it can't find anything by using relevant terms. Folder of curated photos also randomly disappeared. If I didn't have so much on here already I'd find a better app to use. Please get it together.
"This app's page from Play Store has begun starting up every time I restart my Chromebook. It is extremely ill-behaved and hogs all resources, meaning that I have to sit and wait - sometimes 2-3 minutes - on startup, because nothing else can load/run. If anyone can tell me a fix for this I'd be grateful. I can in turn tell you how not to have it happen - keep well away from Dropbox and all its evil. I was on the fence about the product - now I'm not; every trace I see of it goes into trash NOW."
"Terrible coordination with word app for Android. Any doc you try to create in word and save to Dropbox is marked 'read only.' And never even appears in Dropbox, only in word recent docs list. And it it is impossible to save a copy that isn't read only. You can create a working file with word for one drive or for your device without any problem. Microsoft community is of no help despite multiple people complaining."
"What a ""grabby"" app! I've got an AVERAGE of (3) copies of almost EVERY FILE on two devices (laptop & Android), stored in Dropbox! WTH? No wonder I'm 1249% over my limit! It wants me to purchase a TB more storage now, what a SCAM! I'm trying to delete all but ONE copy of each file to keep on the cloud (isn't that the original purpose of cloud storage?) What a MAJOR waste of my time! At least there's a setting to stop uploading new files. Even still, I'd give it NO STARS if that were possible!"
"I've been with them since the beginning. It was perfect in the then, but as they grew, they lost sight of the original intent of their service. Too much marketing. Too many ""features."" All I needed was online storage, not a Microsoft 365 clone that I have to pay exorbitantly each year to keep up. If that's what I wanted I would have gone with Microsoft."
"The app and the website are buggy and have been for a while. While watching a video, the thumbnail from another video will overlap it. Sometimes I can rectify this on my phone by swiping just slightly, but it'll come back. On the computer it's terrible, and basically useless. Extremely disappointing considering I pay like $13 a month for these issues. I'll be looking for something else that works better and is actually maintained well."
"Utterly useless. Refuses to upload even a single image, or takes an hour to do so after telling me I'm not connected to a network, which is false. I've switched back to using the dropbox website on both mobile and desktop with no problems. I've been using Dropbox app on mobile and desktop and it's honestly never been worse. I just bought a faster cable to hardwire my phone to my desktop to transfer files. What a better option ð¤ª"
"I have a few dropbox accounts over the years. But now when I have tons of important videos and photos to transfer over its now glitching on every video. When I open a video, one of my photos is over the top of it. I can see a slight bit of the video at the bottom and it's playing with sound but photo over the top. Need this fixed now or need to get other cloud asap."
"I AM SHOCKED at how BAD this app is - the video replay is TERRIBLE - the screen freezes and plays a different video underneath the frozen pic. I already followed the instructions to uninstall, restart, and reinstall the app - that did NOT work, and that kind of inconvenient ""fix"" should never even be required. I also just signed up for the free trial to get more storage space - if this isn't fixed by the end of the trial, I'm definitely not continuing with the subscription."
"New update and I can no longer upload files. I get a notice, will upload when internet connection is back online. My interent is working fine. I uninstall/reinstall the app, restart, shut down any and all other apps, programs and connections so that only dropbox is using the internet, and still nothing will upload regardless of the file type or size. Anything I try to upload gets stuck on ""waiting to upload"" or ""will upload when reconnected to the internet"". Time to find a new storage service."
"Don't waste your time with with garbage app. Just go to the website in your browser. This trash app can't even download a folder or multiple files at once. Only way to download is touch and hold a file and choose ""export"" then ""save to device"". But that option is not there if you select multiple files or a folder so you have to do it for every single file you want individually"
"A miserable experience. Joined when the app was free. Used it for long-term photo storage. At some point, they must have decided to shrink the storage amount offered by the trial. My account is now missing the vast majority of the photos in it before, with apparently no way to recover them. Too many other good storage options to even consider this one. What an utter disaster..."
"I had the dropbox basic app. It's suited my needs perfectly, all I use it for is to transfer items from my tablet to PC. However, there was a problem, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Something went wrong, because it installed the Dropbox Plus. It is absolutely not what I wanted. It caused all kinds of problems on my system. I've worked with somebody and we seem to have cleared up the problem. However I cannot find the free Dropbox app to reload onto my tablet. What am I doing wrong?"
"Over the years, GREAT! With the latest update, TERRIBLE. I've used Dropbox for 10 years. I've never had a problem. It would sync with my mobile devices and my laptops and my desktop computers. The update on June 3 screwed up my mobile app & I am unable to access my files. The error message is ""Can't connect to Dropbox. Make sure you're online, or try again later."" WHAT??!!! Um, my phone is connected via cell service & wifi. Customer Service was NOT HELPFUL. I am very frustrated."
"Dropbox worked great for many years (5 star worthy), but over the past few weeks the app keeps telling me ""cannot connect to dropbox, make sure you are online and try again later"". I am online and my device can connect to any other app just not dropbox. All docs, files, photos are hidden from view. I can only find the desired file if I search for the specific file. I cannot save files to specific folders nor can I move files from one folder to another. It is now very difficult to use the app."
"I'm really disappointed in this company. I've been a Dropbox user since the very beginning. Suddenly, they've introduced an arbitrary three device limit that makes this all but useless unless you pay $120+ a year. I have no problem paying for valuable services, but the fact that you they want longstanding customers to pay over $120 just to sync four devices instead of three is absurd. This is the writing on the wall, time to jump ship because going forward, Dropbox is going to be looking for every arbitrary way it can to extort money out of longtime users. What's next, caps on how many times you can access a file unless you pay for a new $300 a year ""Elite"" tier of service?"
"Really didn't help me. I was sent a link by email to add a file to a Dropbox, and couldn't see any way to do it. I added the app, hoping that would help, but got a notification that was too many devices and I'd have to subscribe. Working with Dropbox on my desktop didn't give me any more success, even when I enabled ""Dropbox for Gmail,"" so I have no incentive to pay for this app. Maybe it only works if you're a paying subscriber. I find this very opaque on any device."
"I've been using drop box for around 8 years. I've never had an issue with it. Now it's constantly crashing, disconnecting or just not loading. Hopefully they fix it, because this is crazy. Just roll back to the last version. The update on the PC sucks too, but at least you can still access it there through file explorer, which is great."
"There's no way to download folders, only files. If I want to download a folder containing an artist's mp3s, with each album in its own folder, I have to download the individual songs and recreate the folders on my device. Infuriating. Edit: I can't actually download anything. The app says that the files have downloaded, but none of it can be found on my phone. I'm downgrading my rating to one star."
"I have been a thrilled user of Dropbox for years. But now, only 3 linked devices with free plan. I guess they need to make more money. Goodbye Dropbox! Edit: I should add that the entry level option past free is $10/month for 1TB which is way beyond my needs. I really only used Dropbox for sharing a few files among two desktops, a laptop, a phone, and a tablet. Once in a while I used it to share photos with friends. Offer a cheaper option and maybe I will come back."
"Works fine on iOS. Can download files/folders, move files around within folders and my app will automatically fix the problem within my folder. On Android, this app is a piece of garbage. I'm a paying customer like many others and all I see is the same problem: 'storage full or unavailable' when I try to access my files. I can't even view them! Much less download them. I'm an artist and dropbox has always been my cloud service of choice, but if this bug isn't fixed I'll have to reconsider."
"So. Dropbox raises their price above the competition. Yet, for almost 3 years. Yes. 3. They have not fixed a BIG bug with backup. If your roming. Your out of luck with Dropbox. They won't listen or fix the problem. They just don't get it. I have been using them 8 years. I suggest to everyone to change to Google. It's cheaper and does not have a bug issue with camera uploads."
Y'all trippin... This don't make no sense Been using Dropbox reliably and without fail for YEARS...Now all of a sudden Dropbox won't connect even though I've got data and WiFi internet access. Signing out and in again didn't work and if this uninstall to reinstall doesn't fix the problem that's a wrap for this app. It don't matter to me if it works as it's supposed to on my laptop when I can't access my stuff when on my cell. That completely defeats the purpose. FIX THIS!!!!!
"How do I use it if I can't sign in? I can sign in just fine through the browser. However the app doesn't work. With the same password... I can't even reauest an email sign in, or to change the password through the app (by sending an email). Absolutely major flaw.. no cloud storage service could compromise the mobile experience in this way. I have never been a fan of dropbox and this just confirms it. I will be switchint soon."
"When I start off trying to upload it gives me many options and one of the options is ""my drive"". There's an option for files documents and photos, but as soon as you upload one photo it automatically decides for you that you can't go back to ""my drive"" and you can only upload from your photos. It's frustrating and cumbersome. Also, until I turned off camera uploads, it would upload everything in the world that I didn't want to and nothing that I wanted to."
Very difficult!! I signed up for the free trial to see if this would be a good app to send large picture files to family. It has been the opposite of user friendly. Canceling the subscription is way too difficult for a regular person. It says it is sending you to options for cancelling that then don't exist. Just finding out what type of account one has is difficult. I use a lot of apps. I found this one to be frustrating with support fairly unavailable.
"I'm very unhappy with Dropbox deleting the album feature from the app. They replied that I can access my pics through the photo button, no kidding. The problem was I had several pics out of thousands added to albums for easy access but it was changed without notice. I'm now more unhappy with what appears to be an insensitive auto generated response. Looks like it's time to find an alternative solution."
"Dropbox used to be a simple, reliable service to keep extra files and photos. Now it's INCREDIBLY annoying to view photos on the app because several popups to ""comment"" ""copy a link"" or ""share"" a photo come up EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU TRY VIEWING A PHOTO. If I wanted to do any of those options, I'd just access those options on the side of the photo before opening it. Now it's incredibly obnoxious to show pictures to someone because you can't open a full photo directly."
"Not so excited anymore. I've been using Dropbox for about 6 years to backup pics from my phone. I had earned additional storage space to the point of having 8GBs available to me. Lately, I've been having issues with my files and pictures staying synched between devices. Instead of being able to file my pics and documents away, I write this while I wait for my past week's images to be available to me. I'm off to research other services while I wait for synching to complete."
"mediocre with untapped potential. It needs to sync files but only allows you online access, defeating it's purpose. It also doesn't register a micro sd card, only allowing for internal device storage. The app only previews files as well, so you have to download the file to preview it, then download again to actually open the file. The desktop app is fantastic, but the mobile version is nearly useless."
"Tried to test Dropbox out for sharing information in a project with others. I have to verify my email account to get things started, problem is they never send me a verification email. Not in inbox, not in spam/junk mail. Tried too many times. Googled it and it looks like it is a huge issue that can't be easily resolved. I gave up on it."
"I've been using Dropbox for many years and it's true, the user experience has been going steeply downhill for a while now. I already pay for the service but the app constantly continues to ask for me to upgrade. Why is saving photos so convoluted? PLEASE just make it so I can open up a photo, long-press it and have that pop up a ""save to device"" option."
"It is amazing to me that Dropbox hasn't figured out that their thumbnails are so small that you can't tell what you are looking at. Managing photos in Dropbox is impossible, slow and tedious. We had to move 120,000 images to Google photos so we could actually find images without having to open them just to see what we couldn't see in the thumbnail."
"Editor is SO BAD at context/ data loss, you have to ""save"" essentially every sentence. It would be bad enough if it merely crashed every time you switch over to another app for 5 seconds, but it will revert to home directory and drop your editor at random times (you will see the blue logo screen paint, followed by revert to home directory... For NO DAMN REASON). I have had irreplaceable data loss because of this and now use only Microsoft Onedrive, which has exhibited no such problems."
"Signed up for the 30 free trial.  Meh.  Tried to cancel the next day, but there was no button for that in Dropbox.  I had to search for it, and discovered that I had to go to My Subscriptions in Google Play, but COULDN'T.  There's nothing there regarding Dropbox.  Now I'm having a hard time finding the Contact Us link.    Don't sign up for this nuisance."
"Not worth the price and won't let me end my subscription. I've tried everything and even contacted Google themselves, they claim they can't find my subscription but I've been charged. They can't find my subscription, well, neither can I. When I go to subscriptions in my account on play store, it is not there. But when I open the app I am at premium status. When I go through the app to cancel, it says I'm not subscribed. Fix your BS! If you're going to charge that much you can afford better IT."
"Can't figure it out. Can't get downloads off line. Takes forever and repeatedly ""fails"". It is automatically opening this and saving them to Dropbox when that is not where I want it to go. Have spent hours trying to figure out how to change permissions but nothing works. Also very complex to uninstall... multiple places to seek out on computer to get rid of it. Maybe I'm just daft, but it is way beyond me and not user friendly from my view point. Baffeling â¹ï¸"
"I love this concept and Dropbox in general. the problem is: this app FREAKIN SUCKS! Dropbox works great from a laptop or desktop computer. But from a cellphone it blows! I have the settings arranged so that it's SUPPOSED to upload pics (or docs) on demand, whether I'm connected to Wi-Fi or not. And although I do use Battery-Saver on my android (S9 Plus), I have an exception for this app, to be exempt. So it should upload stuff instantly. But half the time it does not. waits for days sometimes! ð¡"
"Great service but the mobile app is basically useless, you can't download the files to use in other apps. As an example, music can't be opened in your media player, instead you have to open Dropbox then open the file in Dropbox to play it and it only plays that song. If you want to listen to an album while driving you have to go to the Dropbox website and download it from there so they actually save to the device's file system and can be accessed by you other apps."
"I signed up for a Dropbox account out of desperation when I was buying a new phone unexpectedly and hadnât backed up any of my photos.  Things were fine for a while, until I was forced to purchase a Dropbox Plus account, which I did not want. I deleted my Dropbox account shortly after that, and for three months, I was still getting billed for a subscription that I did not have anymore. Reaching out to customer service was incredibly difficult, and when a man named Ron did finally email me back, he asked for a lot of credit card information that I was not comfortable giving out. I shortly after got an email that my subscription had been renewed and I had not given ANY CONSENT to activate or renew any subscription I once had.  I got curious and downloaded the Dropbox app to my phone, and when I tried to sign in, it showed no account with their service for my email address. I decided to go through my bank instead and placed a stop payment on any payments that they try to take out of my account in the future. I will be taking further action to receive a refund for the months that they billed me for unethically, and I do not recommend this service to anyone."
How far the mighty have fallen! What was once a dependable go-to for promptly backing up the photos and videos from my phone has now become a complete joke. The sleeping giant no longer auto-uploads no matter what setting I use. Now I have to go in manually & hand choose all the photos and videos I want backed up and then set my screen to stay on for 10 minutes or it will stop uploading. It's bad enough to make me want to go back to Hightail. What a waste!
"Loooove how selecting to save files locally somehow results in files that haven't even slightly changed needing to be re downloaded 20 times a day. Completely defeats the purpose of the app. Absolutely useless. The last time i used it, the only way i could view files that were supposed to be already downloaded was to completely restart my phone. Tons of people reporting fundamental issues with the app... Just make it work!"
Horrendous application routinely fails at backing up my cell phone pics. That's the only thing I ask Dropbox to do. It does work for a while then it randomly stops backing up for no apparent reason. And you have no idea that it has decided to stop..... you think your photos are being protected but they are not. NEXT!!!
"Can't upload any files from anywhere anymore. Every single time I try to, I get an error message that says ""file can not be uploaded due to security risks"" even though I have nothing turned on in my settings or Dropbox options that would cause this. I'm far from the only one having this same issue and telling everyone to download your beta version is NOT helpful. I want to upload files to your FILE STORAGE app that I pay a ridiculous amount for every month to work as it should."
"was a useful app until they took what had been a free feature for like 10 years and turned it into something you need to pay for. they only allow you to connect to 3 devices, more than that you have to pay. but with two laptops, tablets and phones it was great because you have access to all your files from every device but now you dont. I just moved all files to onedrive, bye bye dropbox. charge for something google, box, onedrive, etc all do for free? stupid"
"I've used drop box for years, I only use it to share a few pdf files with my business partners. It works great for that. What I hate is that I have been upgraded twice now, without wanting an upgrade, and it has been very difficult to get refunds. They make it tricky when opening the app on new devices."
"Dropbox lives off their past fame. They haven't been doing anything good for a while, and it only gets worse. The cumbersome interface and limited functionality are still the same as years ago. The features that nobody needs (like Paper) are being pushed in your face. Just compare with Google One -- clean, efficient, and very affordable. Today I cancelled my ridiculously expensive 2TB plan I had for many many years (but didn't really use) - no refund for the remaining 10 months. Never again!"
"You people are more concerned with giving me ads to upgrade than you are with making a reliable service. I stayed up until 3 am working on a lecture. I saved it, watched it synch, closed it, and the next morning when I got to work 40 minutes before class it was gone. I had to start over! I'm switching to Google Drive!"
"Dropbox FORCES you to use this app version on your mobile device, when you'd prefer to the actual site, then severely limits what you can do with the files via the app. ""Want to hear an MP3 that someone shared with you? Sorry you cant do that on the app."" Why? What's the point? Thanks for choosing to make life more difficult for your users, Dropbox."
"Used to have no problems with this app... very easy to use... Not anymore. At the beginning of May I could select the folder I wanted to upload files from, now I am given a list of pictures by date only. I only upload specific pictures to drop box and this is not user friendly at all. I'm not searching through all the pictures I take when the ones I want to upload are all in one folder that I can't get to. Please fix this horrible feature"
"Dropbox changed agreement to three devices only, but said you can keep it installed on existing devices.  I replaced my phone with a new one and tried to install Dropbox on it.  You might think, so what, just uninstall it from the old phone then install it on the new.  But no, you have to uninstall it from all other devices to get down to the three device limit.  Works for me, until I find another app, even if I have to pay for the new one."
"After recent update I am getting the following message when I click on files, ""Can't connect to Dropbox. Make sure you are online or try again"". Obviously I am online as I am writing this from the same device, the OnePlus 7t. I've never had any issues before the update and is quite irritating as I used this all the time. I have tried shutting down my Wi-Fi, try different Wi-Fi connections, no Wi-Fi using data only.no matter what I try it doesn't work and I continue to get the same message."
"Was working fine with auto uploads from my laptop. Then last week (Aug 16) Windows updated latest version of Windows 10. Now Dropbox no longer works. Have deleted, then reinstalled, etc. No icon on screen, no auto uploads, nothing. Have had to discontinue using it. Luckily, almost everything I had on it was still on my hard drive. The main purpose of using Dropbox was to prevent loss of data. Now, here I have essentially lost everything I had on it. Ironic - huh?"
"Signed up for the 30 day free trial, wanted to cancel after a week. It was super hard to figure out how to cancel but finally found it after 30 min of searching around and thought it was done. Nope, they are still charging me 9.99 a month. I cancelled it two more times and now I just got another email saying they charged me again. I'm really annoyed with this app. Don't download!"
"it'd be great if i dunno i could actually access my files. I've had Dropbox for years and let's be real here, the app is currently and always has been garbage. Don't take on storage as you're #1 task and then suck at it. Thumbnails sometimes load, files rarely load, no sophisticated organization of files, and ultimately no confidence in what the product claims to do. just trying to see an old picture requires an export to software that can actually handle it. and yes on good wifi. so sad"
"I received an email saying that I hadn't used Dropbox for a while and should look into it. When I clicked on the link provided, I was given the choice to download the Android app. I did so, and was not allowed to do anything except to upgrade to the pro version via a 2 week trial. I looked at the conditions, noticed that I could cancel immediately if necessary, so in order to get into my supposed files, I subscribed. I had 0.0 out of 2.0 terabytes used. Cancelled."
"After hearing how great Dropbox was I created an account and tried to upload some videos. I got a message saying âCan't upload file. Account full."" Searched ""help"" and nothing came up. Of course there was no âcontact us"" page or info in the app either. So with a BRAND NEW account that shows 2GB of space I can't do anything! A one star rating is one too much. MAJOR FAILð¤¬â¹ï¸ð¤¯"
"I'm done with google. I'm starting with google photos. Dropbox came to mind first, so I downloaded it, installed it, and uploaded around 20 photos to start, so as not to overload it and have it get stuck, the way it does with google. Uploaded fast, made 4 albums and placed photos where I wanted them. So my question is, where are my albums? Details on photos has album name but no albums. If you want people to use your product make sure it works. Problems in the first 5 mins? Really? Not good..."
Doesn't Open. I don't see the point of having this on my computer when I can't even get it open. Everything is updated and how it should be and yet this stupid app will never work. What's the point in having an app that can work on all platforms and claim that it works on all platforms when in truth it doesn't.... I feel like it's more of a Spybot on my computer as it has access to everything on my computer but yet ceases to actually let me view anything. Sketchy sketchy. -10 don't recommend.
"Dropbox used to be such a great app. Now its impossible to share photos, download them to a place where you can share them,etc. I just spent an hour trying to send a photo from my Dropbox in a text to wish a friend happy birthday. No matter how many times you download it, it goes to NOWHERE you can access it to use in a text or Facebook messenger message. You can only send it in a horribly cropped version that advertises Dropbox, forcing the recipient to go to their page to view it. Garbage."
They make it very hard to get your property back. You can download pictures by clickicking on every single one. You can click on the double check and mark them all. But if you have over 1000 pictures you must uncheck them one by one. They wont let you download folders. I cant find any groups to download in chunks. My dropbox has been filled for a long time but im not going to click 1000 pictures twice then select all.
"Upon reinstalling the app after not using it for quite some time and attempting to access Dropbox after quite some time I get a window that tells me I can only install it on three devices and I have to unlink some devices before I can use it. But it only shows two devices on the unlink page. The other devices, ten in number (who knows what the heck ancient devices they even are), do not show up. Had to sign up for plus free trial just to view and unlink them. What the heck. So bad."
"After the Android update this month, Dropbox won't open at all. Uninstalling, clearing cache/storage, resetting allowances, nothing works. The furthest I've been able to get is logging in before it starts crashing again. It also brings up a ""market feedback agent"" error when it crashes. This is the only app I've had problems with since the update."
"This app is truly terrible , i have been a dropbox user for some time and just realized how terrible they were after switching to one drive, much easier and well organized so if you are reading this make the switch dont worry. If you try dropbox on your computer expect everything to be deleted. All my info and music was ""synced"" so basiclly it all disappeared. So 5 years of work is gone. And no way of getting it back, will be moving my whole family away from dropbox."
"No tech support at all. This used to be a great app, but the most recent security patch broke it. Spent months trying to get help from tech support, but no luck. It's nothing by bots who assume you have a common question and repeat the same wrong answers at you over and over. After 3 months, I still can't get ahold of a human, I still can't access my files, and Dropbox refuses to provide a refund, even though I clearly wasn't getting the service I paid for. I'm switching to their competitors."
"Much buggier on Androids than iPhones. When you are playing a song via Dropbox on Androids, you cannot do anything else on your phone without cancelling the playback. Furthermore, in the last couple of weeks the screen freezes during a playback and you have to unlock your phone in order to quit the playback. As someone who pays for Dropbox, I would really like this app update/fixed, or I may have to move to another cloud storage app."
"Great that it syncs photos. It's awful that it won't actually sync unless battery is over 20%, and there is no way to override this. Users have been requesting this for years, but DB rarely changes anything nor have I seen any app improvements. Time to look seriously at Box."
"These companies want you to trust them, pay them ongoing fees, and forget. Yet they don't do basic testing. When they don't get the basics right, how can I trust them for anything? I want to unlink a device. I have three connected. On the page to unlink, I select the one I want unlink but the Remove button is disabled. I receive an error that I must unlink 4 devices. There aren't even four connected. Clearly an untested product."
"Frustrating and costly. Im out $120+ for a broken app. I've always preferred Google Drive, but decided to try Dropbox because my coworkers were using it for gigs to share music and charts. I opted for the Plus free trial. When I'm forced to use Dropbox, I remember that, this 'Pro' thing I opted into at $10/month, does. Not. Work. i tap 'Upgrade' from the app/browser, the app says I have already been upgraded. No way to cancel from the app or website. Scam. Finally cancelled from Subscriptions"
Worst app I ever used. It is really inconvenient. I want to save a few hundred pictures to my phone yet I can only select 1 at a time. jeez. I need to select all and save to phone. also I need to upload albums to dropbox. I do not need to spend 3 days selecting 1 picture at a time. I have 15 albums with 1000 pictures in each one. No dropbox wants to only let you select todays pictures. this makes organization my pictures impossible
"I would use this app more if it didn't crash half a second after I opened it, every time I opened it. I have sent the feedback logs in when prompted more times than I can count. If this service didn't have all the photos of my sisters wedding stored on it, I'd cancel my subscription. As it is, I'm paying for a service I can't use, to keep pictures I can't access. TLDR; App won't open. 1/10. Would not recommend this app."
"Why am I being charged $10 a month? I don't recall approving $10 being taken out of my PayPal account every month. Dropbox is a huge rip off and it sucks. I only downloaded this app because I was desperate since Shoebox closed. Shoebox was free and waaay better than Drop box. I don't even use Drop box, too complicated, and yet you took $30 or more from my bank account. I want my money back. If I could give this app zero stars I would. Very frustrating and confusing app."
Been using this app for years to easily transfer files between my smartphone and my computer. Now I try to get a file onto my phone and it says I have to buy a premium service for that. What the heck? When did that change? That was your basic function guys! Very disappointed. At least the automatic photo upload still works.
"Galaxy S20+ user. Dropbox will not upload more than 100 photos at a time from the share option in gallery. I get half saved and then an error that files didn't upload, so then you have to go and manually find everything that didn't upload which takes an extremely long time. It's also to hard to do it from the app since you can't search through your photos by album on your phone. It's almost impossible to get everything saved :("
"There was an update approximately 7 days ago and now I'm getting notifications that Dropbox has a bug. I tried to open the app, and it closes then I get another error message saying that it has a bug. I pay over $100 a yr (in which the price tends to go up every year or so) for this service. I need this to be rectified asap."
"I don't need to have constant - non-dismissable reminders WASTING screen real estate. I want this new version of the app to ask where I want to upload the items I selected after I spent exclusive time selecting them. It should not have promoted for a repeat fingerprint authentication. I was continuously using the app to select 20 files that it uploaded to - who knows what folder, because it couldn't be bothered to present me with a dialogue box of directories! APP STABILITY & USABILITY FAIL!"
"Used to be great, before they neutered the system. Recently dropbox limited the number of devices that can be linked to the dropbox service without paying for a premium tier account. because of this, dropbox is now overall useless to me. The current state of the system is now officially worse than it was 10 or 11 years ago. Quick way for them to kill the platform and alienate their loyal users!"
"junk! have used Dropbox forever, and now all of a sudden it won't let me update certain file types. I design watch faces for an app... and host the .watch files for download and now..... your app says it doesn't have the permission to read the file. Dropbox will be losing many of it's members if this is an official move! until then, google drive it is! thanks for nothing~"
"The amount of time it took to upload my pictures was annoying, but at least I could do it all at once. I just let my phone sit for 36 hours. But why won't it let me export them?? I have to go about it in a long annoying way and that is so frustrating!! Once I get the time to finish exporting 2000 pictures, one at a damn time, I'm removing this app and never using it again!!"
I just received a Dropbox update. The update changed my preferences. After I change my preferences back to my original choices I found that all of my Dropbox files were deleted. From this point on I will back up to a hard drive as well as to share files between computers. I am very DISSATISFIED with Dropbox.
"Impossible to use. It's not even that inaccessible, I would be fine if it was just complicated, but no, it's just useless. It is near impossible to upload photos to the correct folders on mobile, it seems to randomly select a folder to put the photos in and you cannot change this, I have been trying to back up photos of a friend of mine who passed away for an hour but this app is making it nearly impossible. Would not recommend."
"I thought Drop Box would be the answer to the many photos I take of our local high schools sports. There was a lot of trouble trying to use the link by many of my supporters. Drop Box then wanted more money for additional photos. I decided to go back to Facebook and devices to cancel my account with Dropbox. What an experience I had trying to cancel, the guy on chat was also no help. Believe it or not they do not Have a phone number you can call, they won't let you go. Yes it was less than a month,no cancellation and no refund .Bob Zavala"
Can't connect to Dropbox msg... Dropbox app has worked flawlessly for years. Not sure what's going on but started receiving msg saying Can't connect to Dropbox. Make sure you're online or try again later - so frustrating!!! I thought it was just me but I see the recent reviews. Glad I am not the only one!
It worked fine for a while. yet recently whenever I try to play something from it or download something from it it doesn't work. I even made a request for them to check into this haven't gotten any messages back from them that they even found the issue or anything. please fix this Dropbox I would love to use this app more but if you continue to have these issues I unfortunately will have to find a different software
Junk and I really don't want this. If I could not have it keep trying to update that would be nice. If I wanted it I would download it. I do not need this on my phone to slow it down any more then it is right now. p.s. I believe that it should be illegal for applications to run after to turn them off. Some even turn on even though you manually turn them off in settings. Take dropbox and drop it off a cliff.
"Difficult to get a device that was designed to share to share with dropbox (Swann). It automatically backsup device that attempt to set up account with and can not connect anything else without an upgraded account. Can not unshare main device either. So if it is your phone, then it will automatically share to DropBox and then also will not connect the main device wanted. Customer support? Forget it. Less than helpful as well."
"Bought a new Samsung tablet. Added the Dropbox app as I've been using it for years. Logged in and it told me I have too many devices and that I needed to unlink 13 of them, yet it gave me a list of 12 devices to choose from. The other option is to pay for their Plus service. Not happening. Switching to Google Drive."
Incredibly irritating layout...what is the point of enormous panels on left & right sides of screen??? Too many useless options open up when simply navigating files. Persons who designed this software never had to actually work with files... incredible redundancy. I accidentally signed up for a year of plus..a struggle to even make sure it won't automatically renew..Then I am out of here!!!!
This app is a nightmare. I pay for the service. Unless I have access to the desktop computer there has been no easy way for me to get into Dropbox and organize my files. This is been a project that I've been working on for years. With the disabilities and limitations that I have I'm not always able to get to the desktop. It's frustrating to have to keep learning something only to have it change constantly and having to relearn it again and again only to have it not work from the devices I own.
Poor technical support and customer experience. I had an Dropbox account and cannot get access. I paid for this subscription & then forgot to renew and by then they locked me out. I've tried multiple ways to get access to it with no support. Even to pay for a new subscription & my access is gone. Pictures are deleted. You can't get those memories back.
"Used this for a very long time (10+ years) without issues. Used to be great . However, unfortunately Dropbox became GREEDY. They implemented a restriction on the number of devices (max. 3 devices), which is ridiculous and arbitrary. I dual boot my PC & Laptop and I have mobile devices. I used Dropbox to share my documents across all devices. With the device restriction, I cannot do this anymore. Even worse: THEY NOW WANT MONEY FOR WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY FREE. Avoid this! Now I am using MEGA."
"I changed phones and phone services recently. Dropbox doesn't work as it did in my old phone, with the emphasis on ""doesn't work"". Where are my files? They were always accessible on my old phone. I haven't a clue how to access them. I can use the browser to access them, I guess, but then why bother to have the app? Really annoying.â¹ï¸"
"LOST YEARS of photos!! Had 1000s of photos, paid $99 extra for two years. Was getting no more storage messages consistently but i switched saving new photos to other applications. One day, everything was gone! contacted customer service who researched it and responded w me deleting them all. when i disputed it saying i would never delete my family's memories, i just kept getting the same response. heartbreaking when i requested it get elevated to another member, that was rejected as well"
"Incredibly restrictive, 3 installs at most... for something that is supposed to give you 'everywhere cloud storage'. The app doesn't integrate into android nearly as well as PC. And the cost to got to PLUS is an absurd amount of money with 10x the storage space you are actually going to use. Save money and use Google Drive. It's a far superior value."
"I have about 1 GB of storage available, but Dropbox disables all functionality with the app if you don't update to their latest version. If you want to buy me a new phone that can handle the update requirements of all the latest apps, I'm all for it, Dropbox. Until then, stop punishing users that can't afford the latest technology."
"Horrible app and aweful for transferring pictures from phone to computer even over wifi, pictures will go to drop box but will not appear in the same dropbox folder on the computer. I have the 30 day trial so multiple devices and file size should not matter. I was also using it for this purpose this morning and it was working fine but consistently stops working at random times. I will be using Google Drive from now on and honestly can't wait to be rid of dropbox once I get my files off of it."
I tried to use the backup Dropbox function and it messed up my entire folder system and lost several documents. The chat function was essentially useless and the person was not able to help. I needed my files back immediately because I had a meeting and the email chain was not quick at all. I eventually found out how to fix it after some fiddling but I would NOT recommend using the backup function. It'll mess up your entire filing system.
"Used to be a perfect program, now I would not recommend it to anyone. You used to be able to dee a thumbnail preview on desktop and several months ago it stopped and it is now a nightmare. They keep blaming it on a 3rd party app. This is NOT the problem. I have thousands of photos and can not see what photo is what . FIX THIS ISSUE already"
"Terrible design. Decided to try the app looking for good content outside Amazon Kindle. First story in, and I can't read for more than 10 min without a pop-up to buy coins to continue. I did some quick math, and at $5 for 500 coins, it would cost me almost $300 to finish one story. Yeah, I don't think so. New Stephen King goes for a small fraction of that for a hard copy that also doubles as a collection piece. Total ripoff if you ask me."
"Updated 4/27/23 Good reading app. It has a wide range of books to entertain your interest. The only issues I have is that 1) the ads! I mean, to get rewards are fine. The ones that pull you from reading to Google chrome are annoying! 2) Missing books - Books that's I've purchased with coins I bought are gone."
"I like the fact of having random styles of reading material at my fingertips and on the go. However, I really have a hard time just ready one short chapter a day. I feel like sometimes the ads are too long when earning extra coins. Over all, pretty good I suppose. Just not much reading time available unless you are willing to put in money. â¤ï¸â¤ï¸"
"The writing is that of possibly a high schooler, if not, a middle schooler. It has grammatical errors, spelling errors and sentences that make no sense. However that's not the worst part. They want you to buy each chapter. The books are setup so there are 3 to 4 chqpters for each scene so you only get 3 or 4 mins before having to buy another chapter. WASTE OF TIME!!!! Don't bother using this app!"
"I clicked through a story on social media. It said it was free to read. But that only means one very short, underdeveloped ""chapter"" at a time. The only thing I got to read was the same part that had been in the original ad. So I got some credits. 1000 credits only made it through 37% of the story. That was chapter 40. . $35 later, I completed chapter 108 only to come to a notification that the book had been ""serialized"" and was not finished. I don't recommend this app. It's a rip-off."
"Misleading/frustrating app. Advertised as FREE and initially provide several chapters at no cost, enough to commit you to the story before they become locked. You can collect very limited free coins on a daily or purchase more to continue but the stories have no ending, they are regularly updated. I was reading a novel over 2000 chapters and counting. Also, coins are quickly deducted as you go, even before you reach the next chapter. Many are filled with nonsense and are quite short. Don't pay."
"My opinion has changed. I was into one book. Then it jumped me from chapter 67 all the way to chapter 1000. With out my knowledge. Wasted all my reader points and then I lost my reader points trying to get back to where I was. The ads keep telling me I have a ""message"" from this or that but it is just promotional thing for me to spend more money. This is after almost 2 weeks of use. I am about to be done and find another place to read. A flat rate for each montinth would be much more acceptable."
I enjoy the reading. But to be very honest this site is way too expensive. I spent money on this app and I still have been unable to read the book. I would gladly pay a monthly $20-- subscription to just read what I want. But after spending more than $40-- and still run out of coins without finishing the book !! That was $40 in like 2 weeks. The chapters are so short that is crazy to keep spending money. Now I am only reading the 1 free chapter a day. I tell all my friends to stay away from this
"Inappropriately Pricey. This app has great novels that are intriguing. However, the cost to read the books is more than one would pay for a hard copy. The dishonesty of this has been a turn-off, and my interest is diminishing. It is very pricey to unlock chapters and complete a book."
"Don't use! You will end up paying far more for a book. They bait you and then want money to continue. This occurs at certain points in the book until you have completed it and ultimately paying far more than you should have. Furthermore, the books are filled with filler chapters to make the book longer. These chapters don't have any importance to the main story and if removed, would not impact the story at all. The books are translated from Chinese and are full of grammar/spelling errors."
"Meh! This app needs serious improvement. The biggest issue is paying a lot of money to read a book that seriously needs an EDITOR! The story I'm talking about has a great plot, but it's almost impossible to read. I'm disappointed. Most of the books look like they're pretty unfinished. As others have complained, a book is broken up into 100s or 1000s of chapters. It costs $10+ per 100 chapters so it adds up fast. By the end of a novel, you could buy 3 hardcover 1st editions of said book!Deleted!!"
Downloaded this in hopes of a good reading app. As I found a good story I liked. It quickly became apparent that there would be no way to finish reading it. Each chapter costs more coins. And you can only get a few each day. No ads to watch to get more or anything... just actually buying them and it looks like it would cost $50 or more just to attempt to finish my one story. Horrible!!
"Won't let me do anything. Can't search for novels, can read novels, nothing. It keeps saying my connection is bad or poor, when I have cell service, full bars, 4G. I tried connecting to my WiFi, which is strong, and still the app will not work,telling me that I jave a poor connection. I have updated the app. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Still will not work. Very disappointing, as there was a story I started reading in an ad on Facebook, and I really wanted to continue reading it."
"Cost is rediculous! I mapped out the cost to get all the ""episodes"" for the book I started, and it would cost over 8100 coins which 10,000 coins can be purchased for $100!? EDIT: If you want to supply affordable novels, then supply affordable novels. Do not put up a false front that nearly $100 for one book is ""affordable"". Many other e-reader apps are successful with hundreds of thousands of full novels under $10, and often less than $5. Those authors get paid and supported. This app is a joke."
So my main issue is the price of the novels. They start off 10 coins then almost immediately jump up to 59 coins the next chapter. I feel as though this app is a waste of time and money. You would be better off buying a actual paper back book. In the end you will end up spending close to a $100 (usd) for a book with multiple grammatical errors. Sticking with wattpad if I gramatical errors (not to mention barely any). And you do not have to pay for chapters!
"Costly, the amount of what a person would have to spend to finish a book a person could buy a subscription to Kindle or audibles for a while year. Ridiculous, when their are so many grammar errors as well spelling errors. It would be a set price to purchase a book after sampling the first few chapters. sadly I did this with the last book I get a But won't fall for it again. I'll be expecting a refund of the money I haven't used."
"In the beginning it was fine, however, now only a few pages of the book are released each day. The chapters have been made very short. There are many unhappy customers on the app chat but the app owners are unresponsive. Also, it seems as if the translators are padding the text with repetition and lengthy descriptions of unimportant details to drag out the story and keep readers paying. Update: Believe it or not, it is sucking worse now."
"If you are looking to read this is not the app for you. Anyone with a reading level higher then a first grader can finish a chapter in under 3 minutes and then you have to ""unlock"" otherwise known as spend money to get new chapters. All of the books I have read are full of grammatical errors as well as entire paragraphs of repeated story plots being explained again and again."
"I use a lot of these novel reading apps. This was is practically unusable. The interface is clunky, and almost adversarial to new users. Cost for chapter unlocks is extremely expensive and there is no explanation of how it works. The whole thing feels like a slap dash copy of a different app without any of the things that make the other apps user friendly."
"Rip off. You end up spending 3 times more on a book than just ordering one online or getting in a store. The books are good, but not worth the cost. Had potential then quickly turned into a dud. Sure, they give you ""free"" coins. But it's small amounts and everything is expensive. They're not doing this for the authors, they're doing it to rip people off. That's it."
Expensive. The books are good. But I don't think they quite worth what you end up paying. It's cheaper to buy a book from an experienced auther. I'm all for supporting amateur authers. I just feel a little ripped off. But thats not all after looking at the expense log I was charged multiple times for one chapter. So that doesn't help the whole I feel riped off thing. You can get free coins by coming back everyday. I don't plan on buying anymore coins.
The books are great but I feel like the app in a hole is a rip off. You gotta pay to read the entirety of the books. The cost is way above reasonable. It would cost you well over 100$+ just to read one book and still may not be able to complete it. I love to story lines but I will not spend my money on this app. Even tho it is a few ways to get free coins in order to read but it makes for a very very slow finish ð. If not for the major cost I would gladly share this so with others but rip off!!
"Should have been more transparent as to COST of 'novels'. Would NEVER have downloaded had I known that it would cost $10 to unlock each chapter! Totally disgusted. Once I start reading I like to finish what I started when I started not when the app decides. Plus refuse to pay exorbitant prices for something so inferior. More cost efficient and consistency on other apps or even online and in store bookstores! TaTa all. FYI IMO, don't waste your time or money."
So many things could be better. I can't afford to pay anymore money for this app but reading a short chapter every 2 hours isn't realistic. Especially because you can't build up those hours. If you could not go on the app for 16 hours Ideally that should be 8 chapters not one. It's really frustrating. There should be an ad option or something because the coins should either be cheaper or a new system should be implemented.
"The book i started was actually pretty decent - not any worse written/edited than a lot of cheap Kindle books. But i stopped reading when i realized you have to pay PER CHAPTER, and the price per chapter goes up! I would happily pay a couple dollars per book or for a subscription, but this method is super annoying. EDIT: thank you for letting me know i could buy the book all at once. However, when i looked at how much it would cost to buy the amount of coins necessary, it was $50!!!! No way."
"I am not pleased with this app! It has conned me out of money. I did pay one time to read a book that was really promising but it took a lot more coins than it should have. The chapters are really short as well. The book I was reading could use a good editor, which I would be happy to do. I am giving 1 star because I did like the book a lot! I really hope that you have adjusted this issue. It states that the Chapters are free to read and it is misleading, because it makes you pay or use points."
I picked a book from from a story on Facebook and was the worst one to pick. The book ended up well over 2000 chapters. I tried to read the 12 hour deal for 2.99 not knowing just how long the book was. The story was ok but they don't check for errors so sometimes they confused names sometimes there were repeats again. I thought 12 hours of almost steady reading minus cooking and dishes was good enough but was not. Ended up trying 12 more hours. Not enough. So 1 more time. No more! Done!!!
Very very expensive. Books aren't finished. They literally post most days just a few chapters each day but charge you a fortune.. Very frustrating as the book is very good and you get hooked. I have no idea when the book will end. Good Novel service is horrible. Recent update 2/3s way complete with book. They stopped publishing and went back to chapter 1. People are livid.
"Horrible app. The stories they have are great but halfway through nearly every single one, at which point you would have paid the full price of a physical copy if not more, the translation or writing takes a severe drop. Constant pronoun and other grammar errors, changing character names with no cause, reason or explanation. This is while still charging the same price as well for product that is not only of horrible quality but disappointing for all reaching there as they're invested by then."
"I was overcharged by the app. I authorized 2 purchases of coins for $9.99 each, but was charged for 3 purchases. I still haven't figured out how to even reach customer service to resolve the issue. Also, it is extremely expensive! I have been trying to finish a single story, and the chapters get increasingly expensive. So when you include the fact that I was overcharged, if I want to finish the story I'm reading, it will have cost me $35.00, and the grammar was horrible."
"It is way too wordy, repeating situations, there's very little dialog and way too many explanations and descriptions. Later in the story it gets violent with beatings and threats of death. Once into the story, cash is required to continue. I have unloaded this app. There are other reading apps that allow the whole story to be read for watching ads and the stories are much better written."
"Have not deleted the app yet, but not going to spend another TEN DOLLARS on a book! To own a book and actually flip through it's pages will always be the best experience. But I was drawn into a story, and it's REALLY good, I would love to continue reading, but I've paid THIRTY DOLLARS already in total!!! And I still don't have the complete story? Buying an actual book is both cheaper and gives a better reading experience."
"Outlandish pricing. Don't bother. I got click baited into reading, and the book has me totally hooked. But im $20 in on a cheesy love novel and nowhere near finished. Im the queen of a good impulse buy, but even I have to draw the line somewhere. I appreciate the time people spend creating entertainment, but there's gotta be a healthy balance, and for these prices I'd rather go on vacation and write my own novel."
"Over $200 for a mediocre book? They have got to be out of their minds! I started reading a story I first saw on FB. Got to chapter 21 (page 42) and hit the locked chapters. Used the laughable free coins and read 2 more chapters. Looked ahead to see what I would need to finish. 230,000+ coins and the story isn't finished yet. BTW 100,000 coins cost $99.99. The story plot was good but not that good. And the grammar and continuity needs a lot of editing. Save yourself the trouble and avoid it."
"The search bar in this app doesn't work and won't search anything I have to click on multiple books just to find what I'm looking for instead of using the search bar because it doesn't work. I will gladly retract my rate and rate higher if this gets fixed. Also I can't search any auther I can't see the books they have written, and add categories for book genres. Sometimes easier when you search The books are great and fun, only if you get lucky coming across one because you can't search for it."
I'm giving the app 1 â­ because the novel is great. Other than that it's a rip off. No book would ever cost this much to read. You can earn daily coins but it's only enough for a small chapter which is nothing but a paragraph. I would prefer to purchase the complete novel like I do on Kindle. The plan is to allow you to read enough for free to hook then charge by the chapter. The grammar is off and there is a lot of repetition.
"Got hooked on a book, got the app - as it's supposed to snag you. Stories are good, lots of typos. App is free but books end up costing you more than a paperback unless you aren't in a hurry & are willing to jump through all the hoops to earn ""free"" (only costing your time) points to read a few chapters a day. I'll probably not stick with it after I finish what I started. Edited to add, their good reviews are based on the fact they give 30 reading points only if you leave a 5 star rating."
"Just downloaded this app and realized it is more expensive than others and the price for chapters just keeps going up. I was looking forward to a few stories but I could buy several books for the cost of only a few chapters. I'm really disappointed especially because I'm already having issues with the app itself. No way to add to library, I barely tap my screen and it scrolls up to the very beginning and I have to find where I last read."
"Terrible app! 2000 chapters and every few chapters you need ""coins"" to unlock. I was suckered into buying coins once, I figured ""what the heck"", I was reading a good book and looked forward to finishing. It was dragging on and on, I could only imagine what this ""free"" book would cost me. My advice, don't bother. Just a total waste."
It's another one of those BS book clubs/subscriptions making a ton of money off it's readers. I wouldn't waste my money or your money!!!!! There are some book clubs/subscriptions that charge you set fee for the year and you can read as much as you want. I read can read 2-4 books a week so these book clubs/subscriptions better suit my needs.
"The books are not finished! I am currently reading The Charismatic Charlie Wade. The book is not finished and I've spent over $400. I think this is a scam! The book gets updated everyday, but only with 2 very short chapters. There is a lot of word repetition which makes the book longer than it needs to. I am on chapter 4510 and it seems never ending. The writer refuses to release more chapters a day. They just want to keep us hooked. I don't recommend this app. The books are not finished!"
The stories start out great to get you hooked and then the grammnar and spelling get awful. The story I have been on repeats itself but they are still charging for the chapter. It is ridiculous. There needs to be a cheaper or easier way to get coins for the stories. As much as I love the story I'm reading I hate it too. I just want to finish my story!! This is ridiculous.. don't get trapped!!!! Run!!!!
"When $25 only gets you 25 chapters of a book and it has well over 100 chapters, none of which take more than 5 minutes to read and most take less than 2, it's impossible to finish reading anything unless you're rich! I love the 2 novels I started reading but the paywall makes them unreadable. Every time I close the app it sends me back 3+ chapters and I have to rescroll through them because there's no chapter selection option, or if there is one I can't find it."
"Definitely a rip off. The books are great despite the spelling errors. To buy the coins and have them run out so quickly is ridiculous, could probably by at least 10 books for the price of getting enough coins to just read one book. Also the rewards for reading 15 minutes or 30 minutes is horrible. I can read for a good half hour and look to claim the reward and it says I've read 4 minutes!"
"At first I was excited about this app. I'm totally hooked on the book I'm reading even though it is poorly written with many errors. Good story line, but poor execution. I hate the coins. I've already spent more than 30$ and I'm hardly half way through. The chapters seem like they would only be one page in a hard copy of a book. I would not recommend this app as it is an enormous rip off. Once I finish the book I've started I will be deleting the app."
"The reads are great & that's the problem, because you get hooked on a book, then you have to collect coins but it's not nearly enough to get to the next chapter. This is such a trap App. I have read that many people end up spending hundreds on 1 book! I'm not doing that but it's highly disappointing because I would love to read the not 1 book I started, but now 3 because I started reading other ones while I waited to earn more coins & now I'm stuck at a chapter in all 3 books! 49 coins each now."
"Complete rip off. Some stories have over 1000 ongoing and continually added on to chapters that tries to force you to buy bonus points often. While the stories are good, some of these books would cost over $100 to read one story. It would be better to have an option to buy the book outright or have a monthly subscription fee. I would rather go to an author's site and pay a fair price for their work. Total waste of time and a giant scam, app deserves no stars."
"I am disappointed with the GoodNovel app. Despite having a stable internet connection, the app constantly says that there is no connection. Additionally, the coins required to unlock stories are expensive and seem to run out too fast. I wish there were more options to earn and accumulate coins, as it stands, it's unrealistic to keep up with the expense of reading on this platform. I would not recommend this app to anyone looking for an affordable and user-friendly reading experience"
"EDIT: don't spend money on this app. I was ok with watching adverts to access chapters each day, but made the mistake of spending a few $ on a book I liked. Now they've taken the advert option away and I have to earn a few measly coins each day or spend more money. So disappointed. Wish I'd never put $ up. At first I was annoyed that I needed to use 'coins' to read chapters. The grammar isn't always perfect (ESOL writers?) and chapter can be quite short, but otherwise this is a pretty good app."
"Interesting stories. Good writing. However, too expensive and short chapters. Not much option to get coins. You play 10ads each for 1 x ðª . Only option is to buy coins however the novel is dragged to an extend where yiu endup spending more for which you could buy a book from store, which will be cheaper. Not worth it!! Disappointing"
"One of the most expensive book I ever read was from this app. Even my college textbooks didn't cost me much. Buying the whole book for a certain amount is one thing but making someone pay for every few chapters and that too, not a small amount is ridiculous. If you have coins, you lack bonuses. A very costly experience overall. Please don't be taken for a ride. On top of that, it says this book is getting sterlized, whatever it means."
"This business of buying coins and bonus points it is sooo frustrating. The amount of coins vs the amount of chapters one can read makes this ridiculously expensive!! Great selection of books but not worth the headache of reading a few ""short chapters"" a day! Would not recommend it unless you have lots of extra money just laying around!! Would be cheaper to purchase a hard copy of the book"
"So expensive! Checking in & watching ads, you can get enough ""free coins"" to read 2 chapters. The book I started was well written and interesting, but not worth the $77 it would cost to buy enough coins to download the book. I don't want to only be able to read one or two chapters a day, especially when they are so short"
"The story seems to be interesting, well written. I wish I could by the physical copy of the print on Amazon or eBay. Read the whole book in one go and finish it. The free reading is for the first 15 or 20 chapters and then the pain starts of buying coins or collecting coins. The app is now more like FB farmville or any other games where you can or need to purchase something to move to the next level. The app developers always want a 5 star rating, to give free points."
"I think it is very underhanded that you provide significant content in a story then force the user to subscribe to and pay for your application in order to read the rest of the story. As far, as I'm concerned I'd rather skip the ending than to be tricked into signing up at a cost. Be upfront at the beginning of the process."
"Terrible!! If you pay every other chapter, the book will cost you $50.00 or better. I paid $5.99 and it said it was for 600 coins. The chapters are 13-15 coins per chapter, yet, it won't let me go on without paying more money. The story is fun but it is obviously English as a second language. No one calls their brother-in-law ""brother-in-law"". If the story had been $5.99 total, l would have paid and been happy. It's a total ripoff. Don't bother. Get your free story every month from Kindle."
"This may be free but it will take over a year to read a book. You get 3 chapters per day with bonuses but the chapters are no more than 3 or 4 pages. I can read the chapters in about 4 minutes. If you want to read more then you have to buy bonus coins, to finish the book I am reading it would be cheaper to buy the book from a store, although a chapter seems to be added every day or so. You have to watch 5 x 30 adverts to gain 15 points. You need 18 points to add a chapter. Stay away."
Coins are too expensive. Don't think of installing this app. You need to pay bigtime in able for you to read the books here. It's better to buy books in bookstore than waste some money in this app. I know it's an authors way of living but the coins you need to pay here are too much. There are plenty of good books and author that is less cheaper. Also there's also some app which is way more cheaper than this but still a good read and worth every penny you're going to spent.
"ITS A SCAM! Good stories but what is up with their payment system? I am okay with paying for an entire book in a go. But these guys give credits and you can hardly read 4-5 short chapters in a book of over 200 chapters with the amount of money that you spend to buy one book from the retail store. ITS A SCAM! Also, the ads are completely irrelevant."
It stretches out the stories just enough to keep you reading to get you hooked to spend more money. The chapters are short so they can charge more money.for a $10 book you would end spending $100 or even more if you didn't earn bounes to read it. Don't get started on it
"The chapters for sample novel have characters stating the same freaking statements over again. Avid readers don't need to be reminded of key facts 5+ times in one chapter let alone through the novel. The password security is like going back to the early 90's, just letters and numbers. Why would any intelligent person put their payment information in to buy anything from this app unless they want their payment details stolen for a ho-hum story. I read what I did to help shut my brain off."
I do enjoy reading the different novels but not the part that once you get toward the end of the book they only allow two chapters per day to read. I still have plenty of points... why not allow me to finish at my own pace..I have paid for the chapters!! Not fair!!
"SCAM! The stories are really good but it makes me spend like $10 every so often just to continue to next chapter and I never am able to finish a story because of how high the cost it. NOT worth it, its almost a scam i would pay less for actual paperback novels."
The price of reading a book through this app is ridiculous. I could buy a whole section of a library for the price of reading one book. Earning rewards takes forever so without spending any more money I'll be reading one book for the next 10 years. Don't even start using this app.
"it's great app, easy to use, and free reading, just collect the bonus coin... please don't add so much ads, it's kinda boring because of so much ads, and the unlock chapter is there have 2 ads, it's annoying... disappointed ð in ads.."
"Faced with problem on account with uploads failed,etc but no response inspite of messages. Service is not like when just joined so giving up hope on the service, terrible. Still have 2000+coins but just shows network error all the while. No solutions it seems. Got a response & I replied via email with account details but have not got a response in more than a week, seems it does not matter to them."
"The books on this app are very good, it just really sucks that I have to spend money to actually finish a book. The amount that has to be paid for such little chapters has me definitely considering deleting it altogether and that sucks, but for once I'd like free to actually mean free. You should give people the run down on how things actually work so they don't bother downloading it at all unless they have a pretty penny since you pay as you go to read them."
The story is good but you don't get a lot of reading before you have to pay. I think it can be very expensive to read thease novels. This is not worth it I've spent like $40 or more on a fourth of a novel absolutely ridiculous I should have at least been able to purchase one full novel if not too especially for an online novel and not one that I can hold in my hand this is a waste of money don't pour your money into this app
"Don't bother! Unless you are prepared to pay to read any novels! You earn points for logging in each day, which will open one 'chapter'. But these are barely 2 pages long!! Its frustrating! When you can access whole books for 99p on Amazon, this app is not worth it."
"There are good story however it seems that they are the same plot twist, not sure of the story choices on my part. Before I can wait each day to unlock the chapters but when I bought some coins then it stopped for all the story I don't know if this is how it works but the app is not really worth the money to spent."
"Amount of coins needed and chapter sizes changes throughout the book. Multiple times have spent hundreds of dollars and still never got through with the book. You're better off buying books on an e-reader, or at a book store. University text books do not cost this much!"
"This app cheats you out of your money. I've paid for coins and bonuses on a few different occasions and each time I wasn't given the appropriate amount of reading time that was paid for. Each chapter is 22 coins, I paid $10 for 1000 coins, which included 50 bonus points and after 5 chapters it was telling me I needed more coins or bonus points. Something is not adding up. I also paid $5 twice for 500 coins.The entire book should have been paid for after spending a total of $20. The app would 5"
Ridiculously expensive. Coins vs chapters you can read is not worth my while. I'll rather purchase hard copy of books. Not enough options to earn 'free' coins per day. Struggling to read 1 chapter of a book with the free coins. Gems could also be used to buy chapters and so on. Would not recommend this app. Just to expensive! Pity because I do enjoy the selection of books.
"It's frustrating. You start reading a book and get super into it, but then you have to have coins to read the next chapter, which usually ends up only being a page and a half, if that. Unless you're willing to buy coins, it takes you over a month to read a book. By that point, it's not even worth the hastle. Save yourself the time and headache and just buy a book..."
I downloaded this from FB after reading the preview. These apps claim the books are free to read but once you go to the spot you left off you're asked to buy coins. By the time you've paid for enough coins to finish the book you're out $20+ for a book that you don't even get to download(after paying of course)
I like the book I'm reading but it is absolutely ridiculous the amount that you have to pay to get coins for reading chapters. This book is way more than $500 to read one book. Definitely not worth it. The costs of the chapters constantly change as well and you also lose your bonus coins without notice
"Ridiculously expensive. Paid 9.99 so I could get extra bonus coins, just to have them run out and I hadn't even made it a third of the way through the book. So you're telling me I'm supposed to pay close to 40 dollars for a book that has typos and isn't even a hard copy? Not happening. Gonna go back to Kindle and read my unlimited books for 16 bucks a month."
"I really loved this app, but recently something has been reset and it's making me pay again for books that I have completely paid for. I have not received any real assistance from their help desk, their best suggestion is for me to log out and read them on a visitor account, which IS NOT where I paid for them! What a rip off!"
"A great app with many different varieties of great books. I'd give it a 5*, but having to ""buy"" chapters to read is very off-putting. Especially when some books have thousands of chapters. I'd understand if it charged 3, maybe 5 coins to advance each chapter. I would appreciated if you stopped taking all my coins too, I don't always have a chance to read, so you taking my coins is very frustrating. And why are chapters 20+ coins when it used to be 8-13? If I could if give you 0*."
VERY EXPENSIVE I have had to pay a fortune to try to finish reading my book. Now every page and a half it wants 22 more coins or bonuses. I click on it and it's using more than 22 bonuses. What a rip off I want to finish my book but probably won't cause I'm not spending anymore.
"I love to read and find new stories of new worlds through books. These apps, whilst legitimate apps are scams, the chapters are purposely short, to keep people who love reading paying. I paid Â£15 and am only on chapter 54 of 202, a quarter of the way through. Taking into account that the first 6 chapters were free so I paid to read 48 chapters. To finish this book, I would have to pay an additional Â£50 totalling Â£65. Even great authors don't charge that. Save your money buy from book stores!!!!"
"This app should be banned, poorly written novels that don't seem to have an ending any time soon. Been on this app for almost 3 years and I'm calling it quits. Novels are poorly written, no sense of direction, no ending in sight, a lot of over explanations. This app is designed to suck your money out of your pocket. Overpriced!"
I am going to finish the book because it's a good book but this app. Suck you have to pay every couple of chapters. You get some cion by watching video's but not enough to read the book .I can go buy a book cheap at the store and there are other apps you don't have to pay every couple chapters. So this a bad app I don't recommend it
"The stories are pretty decent but the amount of money you have to pay inorder to read is to costly. Not to mention there are new ""chapters"" added each day,so these ""novels"" are never ending. I will not purchase any more as I have already brought enough to buy 3 novels out of actual bookstore."
"I love reading & quite often read new authors from the free list. This app is easy to navigate & there are plenty of books to choose from... however... It costs 17 coins/points to read a chapter. You can either pay for coins or watch ads. You are allowed to watch 5 ads per day for a bonus of 3 coins each, which yields 15 coins. (How much money do they make for me watching that many ads? I should be able to buy the entire book for that!!) You do the math... I think I'll stick to the free list!"
"I think this is way over priced ! You have to read for 15 minutes to get a bonus ! It only takes 5 minutes to read a chapter ! And considering if you bought more coins , you're probably spending 45Â¢ a chapter . In a regular book a page is equal to a chapter here ! If you pay for every chapter it would probably cost you $100 ! Why would I want to pay that for these stories ? They are not even that good ! And if I checked in every day to get my free coins and bonuses , it would take 3 years readi"
Hate to have to buy coins to read. Easier to just do the option to use coin or watch an add to get to the next chapter . Hate having to wait 2 days to read half a page. The books are interesting and edited better than other sites.
"App needs to be a bit more polished. Contents are good and I do believe they have good material. However, the price to finish a full story is unbelievable expensive! Horrible business model! Too greedy"
"Scam! I can't believe I spent a good part of my night reading 20 chapters on an app that said to ""download it's free"". Before I could go on to chapter 21 my options were pay or pay. It is not free at all. Be upfront. Time is precious and your half-truth wasted mine. I wouldn't have had an issue paying, had you been honest. It was easy enough for you to put a pop-up at the end of chapter 20. Maybe consider putting the same pop-up a chapter 1."
"It could let you read without asking for money every 10 minutes. I wish they had others ways to find stores and a better choice of stores. It ask me for a review, to get coins to read a story, not if I'd like to leave one. There's only one story I like and I'm about to contact the author and pay her/him for there stores!!!"
"The storyline was good from the off but frustrating that they give so little bonus to attain each day to read a couple of pages, so if you don't want to spend then little point starting otherwise you need deep pockets or lots of patience. I logged in and built my bonus up over 3 months without reading and when I came to use it and start reading again it wasn't there so a complete waste of time. If I get to finish the story I will be removing this app immediately after. SO DISAPPOINTING!!!"
"I don't like the coin thing. This app charges you every few chapters. I would rather know the cost of the book before I purchase and read it, instead of being charged constantly and have no idea of the final cost of a book."
I like this app for it's choice and easy access but it is quite expensive. The chapters can be really short but still cost 30p each. I like it cause I can earn coins but it takes a while to build them up. Just checked and the book I'm reading drags on for another 30 chapters and isn't complete. I've already spent over Â£15 on it! No more! ð¥
"Why is it that novel apps these days lie about whether their books are free (the use of data) or not free (the use of bought coins). It's really not fair or right for you to tell people that your apps are free, then when we've used (wasted in the long run) our data to download, we can't read cause we have to buy coins first. It's not gonna hurt if you tell the truth, many people have the ability to buy coins but many don't too. So why not just state it from the beginning instead of lying!!!ð "
"Advert said short novels, That's not true. It is also expensive. I haven't even finished the novel and I had to pay $4.99 twice and the app asking for money again. So how much is one novel? So no thank you. Buy a book on Kindle or in shop, and you will know exactly how much does it cost."
Get interested in book Get to a point then must pay to continue. Prices much higher than on other apps. This could almost be considered a scam. Should inform readers at the beginning that there's a charge to continue after reaching chapter xxxxx. Books not that great to pay Prices higher than Amazon
"Long, expensive, not worth it. I love to read. But if I'm dropping $10 on a book, I expect the book, not some chapters in a long drawn out story. The stories are poorly written, and the writers are probably not native English speakers. The intent is to keep you paying for more chapters. The value to cost ratio is terrible."
"The method of payment for every chapter, buying points is complicated, expensive & cumbersome. The entire book can be paid for at once. Also too many mistakes. I hv seen better Apps."
"Taking away unused points/bonuses before expiry date. Giving bonus 4x only instead of 5 (watching 5 videos, received bonus 4x only). The novels are boring and predictable, not worth time and money/effort. At least, the grammar is mostly correct."
I'm on chapter 39 of over 1900 chapters. And it cost me $5 to get to 39. Not sticking around to find out how much the whole book will cost. The free check in points just get you a chapter at this stage. That's a chapter a day for how many years? Time consuming!! Costs money if you want to actually read a book instead of referring people and checking in daily for points. ððð
"I used to do multiple selections when sending pictures or files as documents now after the new update. It only allows one at a time. It's very frustrating. Please review and revert this changes. Of am sending 20 docs to a person, do I have to select and send one at a time for 20 times? What's the use of multi select when it can't be utilized."
"It used to work as a messaging app once it represented an alternative to Blackberry Messenger, now it is a heavy application, with no respect for the users, you must adapt new policies or get out the ecosystem. It takes a long time to load. It consumes a lot from memory device. It is not uniform, you can not send files from an iPhone, etc. Absolutely disappointed and completely unplugged from the brand."
"It keep stopping. I open it, then it closes immediately. I have unistalled and reinstalled it, then did a factory reset on the fhone and reinstalled it. It keep stopping. I eventually did a factory reset and installed it without downloading the backed up messages. It worked a while, but now it does the same. When trying to report it, that function also stopped."
"The app was OK until my pictures used on the app started becoming blurry. When I send photos to people, they become blurry. When I upload photos on my status, they become blurry. When I update my display picture, it still becomes blurry, not just on my phone but on other people's phones too. This experience is making me frustrated and unhappy. What can I do to stop this, please?"
"Sending photos never be this terrible in my life. If you sending it from photos you'll get heavy compression, if you send photos from documents you'll get uncompressed photos but only for one file. I mean what are you doing guys? You are destroyer of your own company. Many marketing and all feature and still misses something like this?"
Overall good but i have 2 problems with this app My mic. Is always used by whatsapp business and that drains my battery. When I'm on video call i pause a video and want to play again it shows me my video is paused but for other person he can see my video.
"It is great until you have an issue. Don't expect much support as they really do not care about you, regardless if you are a business or not. I would suggest finding something better. They do not have phone support, only email support and it is bad, very bad. You have to open a new request every time you want to correspond with them. If you wish to have a business I would not recommend WhatsApp. I am still trying to get my number working again with them after an issue, but before it was great."
"I just updated my whatsapp few days ago, and I've not been able to view status, I can't send voice note, if someone send voice note to me I won't be able to listen to it, I can send pictures and I can't view pictures sent to me. What could be the cause of this ??"
"I can't say any more, every day it's not getting better, but it's getting worse. Many times it resets itself, when it's going to restore it can't, but if I click skip instead it's gone, Lots of updates but no progress, don't just focus on updating things that aren't important, but also updating other important things, you just make users uncomfortable."
"My WhatsApp suddenly started crashing whenever I open it, it takes me back to home screen. This started yesterday I had to uninstall it and installed another one and it has started again how can this be resolved cause it's frustrating"
Your UI is not responsive It was cutting my screen from bottom ( when i click on see viewers on the status the first person who had seen my status is half cutted therefore i am not able to see who had viewed my status firstly ) Resolve this issue ASAP.. I have some screenshots where do i have to post them
"If there's anything less than this ,I swear ð¤¬ it would be what I would have given it. I get it hard to send messages even after updating the app , whenever I send a message it keeps showing not sent with a warning sign"
"My Normal WhatsApp don't recognize most of my saved contacts numbers anymore, like If I didn't save them at all! Only shows the numbers and Not what I saved them over many years. See attached screenshot of one of the over 3000 contracts i have it saved in my Google account. As we can evidence#1 the ""WhatsApp Bussiness"" is the one causing this problem. I have installed the WhatsApp Business with my secondary Sim card in this Galaxy S21 Android phone which had the normal Whatsapp."
The new update is annoying ð¤¬I don't like the split version ð please I would prefer to go back to the older version where it's easier to swipe reply because this new version has a lot of errors and bugs that I think the developers needs to fix ASAP ð at first I thought the issue was from my tab but now I know it's WhatsApp error ð­ I can't even post on my status or voice notes don't load or play sometimes .......just too many things to complain about just give us the older version please ð¥ºð
WILL NOT TRANSFER MEDIA FROM OLD WHAT'S APP. Please refrain from singing into this app if you want your past documents / photos / Videos to be preserved. This app only restores Texts and ignores everything else which is too high of a price to pay just for an in-app catalogue. More over it also deleted backups of previous WhatsApp app from my Google drive so I cannot restore my old lost media :(
"The new layout split screen version on the unfolded z fold makes horrible to read messages , only on half of the screen . Also there is some bugs since this was introduced , like i cannot click on some links , buttons , within the conversation window or even some phone icons at the task bar . That's why i left the beta program thinking that installing the regular one would make it go back to the way it was . But it didn't . Please add in settings a switch to toggle to chose if i want this split"
"I was facing the problem with WhatsApp business from the last update while making a voice call the call gets picked up but the status is showing connected and then the call get dropped automatically. Kindly fix the same asap. Thank you! Regards, Chetan"
"Since I downloaded it, I can't open the app when my network connection is on. Whenever I put on my network connection and open the app, it automatically shuts down saying ""WhatsApp business keeps stopping"". Most times it keeps giving me d message even when I'm on other apps. Pls dis is my business and I need it sorted out immediately. I can't even go to the setting and back my messages up so I can uninstall it and install later. Pls I really need it sorted out urgently"
"Dear whatsapp, can you kindly explain why the categories that I've created keep disappearing but they don't ever reappear. I've had to recreate categories twice and it's really frustrating and inconvenient. I use whatsapp business daily and the categories make it easy for potential clients to filter what they are looking for. Please look into this, thanks in advance."
"After the latest update, when we write 3/4 lines in the status section, the letters become small in size and extra space remains above and below the written status. Due to this extra space, the written status become small, that doesn't even looks good. (2nd) when we want to see someones profile picture, we automatically go to the status section, because of green circle around the profile picture, whether we want to see the status or not. These two latest updates are Verrrrrry annoying. ð"
"This new version is interesting and all, but i have to mention that there a few bugs with the app! It suddenly crushes or stop or even spit me out when I'm in the settings! Please, fix these bugs, but the rest of it, it's cool actually!"
"Kindly add an option to toggle between split screen and full screen on d z fold version. This new update makes it difficult to use the app. And multiple bugs exist on the new update on z fold. Can click to referred messages, status or link."
"This is my first time downloading this app and it's really fustrating I even had to uninstall and reinstall, people's status just disappear and saved contact will start showing just numbers secondly if I post pictures and videos they don't upload and the ones that manage to upload will only have few views cause they are not showing on my contacts status please and please fix this."
The new split screen is a retrograde step! The split feature is annoying and awkward to type on small screen devices. We can no longer swipe right to tag a message to your replies. This upgrade is LAME!!!
"The date of the messages is constantly changed automatically and they go to times other than the current date, and this problem cannot be solved by updating or deleting and reinstalling the software. This is very annoying."
"This app can be so annoying, i don't why it takes me more than two days to upload my status, most times i'm unable to see some of my contact's status, Even i'm unable to see all those who view my status, now I already updated, it I pray I don't encounter such again . Please something should be properly and immediately done about it, i use it for my business. Thanks"
"There is an issue with my WhatsApp business, it never loads and blinks over the screen all the time. The issue is from today morning and I uninstalled the app than reinstall but still I'm facing the same, whereas the simple WhatsApp is working perfectly fine. Thank you!"
"I don't like the application anymore. I don't get notifications of new messages unless I enter the application which is very bad and I'm not happy with that. I started having such experience after updating my watsapp till now and it will be a nice thing if you work on it. After my report few months ago, it still happen. Till when will I stop having these problems? Why can't you guys fix this issue for me? When will I continue to loose my client due to lack of communication?"
I didn't liked the new split screen version in my tab. It is becoming very difficult to read the messages properly. Kindly get this to the older version like it used to be! Thank-you.
"Team Whatsapp, Whatsapp Business App not opening at all, my entire business communications are saved over there . It's just crashing and not being able to do anything,it's just not opening.Using the most updated version. Please help asap to restore."
"I dont like this new version of the whatsapp,it skips status and that process implies you will have to b online247 so that you will be able to see d person status,same implies for my status viewers.they always miss my status when they are not online.And its bad using it for business,cause my status views keep decreasing. Hello,i cant seem to be able to upload on my status.i have gone all through whatsapp support said.but its not still working"
"The split screen should be an optional format. Can't get to reply to an individual message in a chat. Videos are slow to load in chat. Videos on statuses are slow to load, sometimes blurry or doesnt load at all."
"Something wrong with this update. Won't sync new contacts and takes forever to send messages Update: getting ""your message was not sent"" for many contacts, but whatsapp web works fine. I don't send spam, I literally only contact my clients and people who work with me."
"Crashed again 29.04.2023 Crashed again, lost all the cataloges group and lists, 6000 customers chats . . . On 18.04.2023 Crashed again on 11.04.2023 I have to re install it It crashes again on Xiaomi Redmi note 7 It crashes every week! And I had to install it again .... Labels are great. Catalog is great. But you loose data, or your data is some how mixed up when changing phones, or changing numbers. It stores each video that you send on your phone and eats up so much space of your phone."
Biggest bug since WhatsApp calling is launched. When someone video/audio call. When you use volume button it silence music but annoying call vibration is still active. WhatsApp do not have any control when I press volume down/up button during an incoming audio call ringtone get silent but vibration don't stop it keeps vibrating as long as call is not picked up.
Keeps closing automatically. I can't access my messages at all. This app is useless. What's the point of having an app if you can't access your messages. Bekar app
"WhatsApp Can't Scan Error. As User........... Write comment or review for business WhatsApp application. Subject is can't scan on computer web worst application I'm sorry to hear that you've been having a negative experience with the business WhatsApp application, particularly with its web functionality. It's frustrating when a key feature like scanning doesn't work as expected, especially when you rely on the application to communicate with your customers or clients."
"It's great you've given option to add cover photo, however it's basically of no use as normal WhatsApp users (mostly clients) can't see it. Why would you not allow it to be seen even by normal users? Enable the feature now!"
"Horrible experience!!, Whatsapp has been logging me out of my account for no reason or prompt whatsoever, then whenever I try to log in back I get a ""Your account has been banned"" message!!. Which is very annoying and a huge inconvenience to my day to day activities. I've tried multiple times to reach out to them on their support platforms and yet all my efforts are to no avail."
It's not showing right information about who is viewing my status!!many clients are viewing and having queries but it's not showing that they all are seeing!!pls fix ths issue Split screen version is the worst please replace it with older one
Disliking the split screens. It's not user friendly for people with eye problems. There should just be an option to activate and deactivate the split screens
I switch to WA business it's supposed to port all my chats from WA to business. but it still shows the old chats from business when it's was used previously with another number. So now it's mixed chats from WA and old WA business chats together. I reinstalled the WA business but still the same. Now I'm stuck with a 7 hour waiting time for the verification code as I try to troubleshoot between WA n WA business. no one replying my email from support.
This update is super terrible and deserves no star at all. My messages are 5 hours behind and I keep getting logged out every 5 minutes. The network here is great so that's not the issue. This version should be downgraded or improved immediately.
"If you want an app to HELP your business, stick to normal Whatsapp or telegram. I have been by blocked by Whatsapp business FIVE times in FIFTEEN days of using it. I have sent less than 2 messages a day on average and still have been repeatedly flagged as a spammer. I haven't even changed my contacts to the new number because instead of helping communication, this app CUTS communication with your clients. Don't download it. You might just be banned for no reason and lose your number entirely."
"They make it unnecessarely difficult to change phones without losing your data, other apps automatically have all my previous phones data exactly as it was on my new phone. But whatsapp I lost it all."
"No longer showing my friends contact names in the chatting section only numbersð but once i search any of my friends by name it will show their name oh, but the moment i tap on the person's profile for chat the name will no longer show again, only the person's number i will be seeing in the chatting section, i have been facing this issue for long now!!!. What can i do to fix everything back please help með¥ð¥"
"This is the most stupidest app I've come across so far. All my chats disappearing and the app closing telling me my chats history has issues in the middle of an important issue. Made me loose customers and chats due to it malfunctioning. I set it on back up everyday, it's not backing up. God forbid Worst app ever!!!"
"Way too many ads just in the download part. 30 minuttes later I still am not done with the set up, because of the ads popping up every time I click next."
"The latest version is problematic,the window chat is now appearing across the right center of chat which makes it difficult to view other contact's chats/ list. Please fix this error Plus some messages don't deliver unless you open the App"
App is crashing again and again. Kindly look into that. It never happened before. Also I have sent feedback through mobile operating system. Request to resolve the issue.
"WA you have to update this.... Because whenever I share something (ex - photos, videos) it automatically dicrease the quality of those... Being such a huge company why can't you guyz fix this small problem... My apologies if there's anything wrong... Please do something about this matter... Thank you"
"This application is the worst. One morning I suddenly got banned without any reason. I am working for a reputed company, and my phone number is my official number. So I sent a lot of emails to the support team, but they didn't do anything. I am very disappointed in their response. Last 6 days my number is banned still there is no solution. So I am requesting that others please try some other applications, like Telegram.."
Whatsapp business lagging alot. Like normal whatsapp working fine than this. More to calls and video calls are lagging aloooooottttt. Tried reset my mobile and tried uninstall it too. Still same. Not a network problem because my other whatsapp is going great with calls and video calls
I don't like latest upgrade on my tablet. The split screen is annoying. There should be an option to have it removed. I don't like this. Offer an option it's most annoying!
"I used to love this app but now it keep saying ""business Whatsapp failed"" and keeps clearing my chat history with my clients and I can't even forward messages anymore because it says ""original message has been deleted"". My business Whatsapp keeps closing it says it has a bug. This is inconveniencing my business"
"Sharing of pictures, documents all at once with a caption seems like hell ð, Fails to fullfil it's assignment. Once you selected the Chats/group you want to share them with and with Little caption on them, it fails... Whatsapp community why?. You Guys needs to fixed this before I can change to at least 4stars"
WhatsApp business is crashing. It is the worse situation ever. It is repetitive since yesterday. Not able to view messages or communicate. I have reported it t consistently but no solution so far.
The split screen is a bad experience for me. There should be an option to choose between split screen and full screen. I don't see the need for this upgrade at all. I give WhatsApp only 1 star because of this.
"My number was blocked from what'sApp business a for no possible reason. I deleted a non existing group that I couldn't open. After selecting the group the delete option popped up I touched it and my what'sApp shut down and banned my number. This is the 4th number for me that was banned. I contacted support 2 months ago and I never recieved a response. After my first 3 numbers got blocked, I read the terms and conditions for the app, I literally didn't violate any of the rules. 0 stars!"
"A scammer interfered with my WB and since then it stopped working. Always showing ""you are banned from using WB"". I have sent several emails but received no response, neither was my account restored. I just gave up on WB."
I have downloaded and installed whatsapp business but I can't open the app as it keeps on crashing and showing an error. It's been more then 2 weeks now. Please help.
"After the update, sending many document files simultaneously could not be done. This is very annoying. Please fix it"
I want a update from your side that if any number is registered on WhatsApp it should be always in working condition if the sim can not recieve or make outgoing calls the WhatsApp on that no should not work. If the no gets switched of the WhatsApp shouldn't work. I think your team need to work on it. WhatsApp is the source with the help of which there are no of frauds in the country now a days. So you should make an update. Also there should be location and call acces to the police...
Two major to be developed and 1 minor issue 1. Business sector depends on sales n payment but payment option missing why should I share third party payment option 2. Why do we need third party app for adding new chat without saving contact even for sharing catalogue for recent call or new customer 3. Minor issue business profile status to be visible even for unsaved contact from both end similar to Instagram account stories
I was sent a voice note since 3hrs ago and am unable to download it and listen to it. This happen same thing yesterday. Kindly work on this as soon as possible.
"My WhatsApp Business just suddenly stopped opening.. I've uninstalled and installed back several times and it keeps telling me ""something went wrong, close app"".. This happened a day after updating it. What should I do?"
It takes forever to receive or send texts. I find this to be very annoying. Viewing statuses works normally.
Uploading or sending any pictures or video is being much frustrating as the quality of pixels in pictures & videos become Very poor that it doesn't looks clearly even though it was of good pixels & of high HD quality ð
I don't understand why you would ban my phone number from using this app. I need to conduct my business but you people have made it impossible for me. I have transactions I need to complete but I can't since you banned my number with no valid reason. What was the point of allowing me use the app in the first place if you were to compromise my transactions.
Whatsapp got to update to be able to not compress image and video quality or give it as option. All other apps are sending way better videos and pics than whatsapp. Take this seriously people are using other apps.
Video calls creat problemes .when video call is playing i can't get back .if i do it and come back to the call then the call remain pause video remain mute and then disconnected it self .i face this problem for many days plz fix that problem and video is not clear blur video call is playing in the buisness whatapp
"App keeps on stopping, un-installed and reinstalled, and it happened again... Bought a new phone and it happened on the ne phone too... So I basically can't use the app anymore."
Worst and horrible experience. Logged me out without any reason and put alert as your account has been banned. I tried to contact them multiple times but I didn't recieve any response or resolution.
"Experiencing a serious issue, when I am sending documents by selecting them, only one document is sending and other documents deselecting automatically. â¹ï¸â¹ï¸â¹ï¸â¹ï¸â¹ï¸"
Linked device option is unable to scan the QR code. Camera Stuck at one place. Not moving with mobile phone. However Camera is Working fine on normal whatsapp.
I couldn't send multiple documents at a time in the new update.It is very frustrating to select and send one file at a time.
We can't send multiple image as documents file. Only one image is send as documents file after selecting multiple images it's big bug please remove this
Since last 5 days I am having trouble in sending messages to any contacts. Msg is getting delayed in sending. Neither my status nor my settings is being changed.
"Can't use WhatsApp and WhatsApp business in same phone with different mobile numbers. Getting error ""INSTALL_FAILED_DUPLICATE_PERMISSION: Package com.whatsapp.w4b attempting to redeclare permission com.whatsapp.sticker.READ already owned by com.whatsapp"" Instead of giving new features, please focus to fix old bugs."
"I am facing an issue in this app. When i open it, it give a message that app is crashed. It opens for a while and then closes. Please suggest me what to do."
"i really get comfy for using whatsapp business, tapi anjir lah... sukanya tiba2 ke restart sendiri, ilang semua datanya, chat nya, dan lain sebagainya. udah gitu, gak bisa dipulihkan padahal selalu mencadangkan pesan tiap bulan. c'mon now, you dissapointed us to much, fixed it. jangan cuma nambah fiture ini itu ini itu, fix this problem first. i get really sad and much cry i spend on that problem, it's been my 10x now. fix it. FIX IT."
"This is too annoying how l can be having my data on the phone, and this WhatsApp doesn't want to operate irrespective of my pending orders, l check here on play store it has no update, Am l literally banned or it's like that for everyone, feedback awaits"
App started crashing down so frequently so that I can't message my customers. I have Android 13 and after the update it after that it stated being more crashing ð
I would literally uninstall the app as my problem is not getting solved from many days as I told before whenever I send videos to anyone from my contact it becomes green please help me if you could or else I have to uninstall this app
The latest update is horrible. I linked my device to whatsapp web and the app crashes every 3 seconds from there on.
WhatsApp should have backup point to maintain backup day wise. Unless after delete the chat and backup complete it's not possible to find or restore precious chat history.
Bad experience ..... ððððððð Due to malware my old phone was dead .. so I got a new smartphone. but it showing my account is banned. WhatsApp was not caring .. i sents many mails but .. but problem is not solved
Why does i face the issue after the every update ( whatsapp business stopped) when i try to open the app the same problem repeats again and again and it's not working what should i do now guide.. please
This is business whatsapp but its not capable of handling multiple group and personal chats.. Always keeps crashing.. No option for multiple device link
"Worst app ever, my account getting blocked frequently every week. No one is supporting from whatsapp team. There is no escalations matrix and no any contact informations."
Please remove the split screen layout for Samsung fold. It's terrible to type and read and full of bugs!!!!
My WhatsApp number banned with out Any reason. The are telling I'm violated the terms. But actually I don't know what was the issue Soo alla my works are pending and my 70% of data missing I'm mailed to what's up. But I don't get any useful reply What is the steps to remove bann
"After the new update . Even while using business account. My number keeps getting banned for no reason . When I want to add a participant to a new group , I will get banned . When I want to click on a group link and entered I also get banned . So I don't know what's the point of the business app if you're keep getting banned for no reason . It's very very very very stressfull . Please FIX THIS BUG OR WHAT SOEVER ."
I downloaded Whatsapp Business and tried running it several times but its always unable to verify by either SMS or call. All other SMS are reaching my phone except the SMS from Whatsapp. Please help resolve.
This app is meant for business. Probably they do not understand the pain of small business. Trying to install the WhatsApp since last 24 hours not getting the verification done. Reached out to all their existing support but still not resolved. A day is enough to kill small company like ours
"Okay I am confused right now... There is this rumour around about your latest update .. ""If a post is made and some persons are not online they'd not be able to view the post since they were offline when it was made"" If this is true, I am extremely devastated! It defeats my use and purpose for downloading your app and I might have to look for other options soon."
"whatsapp is not working in my pc, please support . I need whatsapp in my pc and ita urgent to solve this issue . This issue is been in my pc from last 3 week. Please look into it. Thank you."
"After the last update the app is UNUSABLE in Samsung Dex mode! You can't see what you type! The typing area is almost not visible, its 80% is out of the app area! Please fix ASAP!"
"The recent update was the worst one, the names on the chat r not showing up anymore. Test it, then send an update."
Since the update am unable to open my ads or create another ad on the app it just saying something went wrong try again it been 8 days now I tried uninstall it and install it again it was still the same
"Automatic 1 â­ rating for unskippable feedback prompt on first launch of the app. This is inexcusable. 1) the prompt should be skippable, and 2) it shouldn't occur on first launch of the app when the user hasn't even been able to use it yet. Apart from the terrible feedback prompt, the player is the only one that I've found which runs reliably on Samsung DeX and has all the features I need. Fix the horrible feedback prompt situation, and the rating will go to 5 stars."
"There are a few things that concern me about this app. One is the ""download"" browser. Is a chrome-based browser but for some reason the developer removed all of the options to prevent cookie tracking and other security issues. But they allow you to save your password. How is that not suspicious. There is no legitimate way to block redirects and pop-ups. second issue is that they intentionally buried the settings option to opt out of having your information collected and sold for ads."
"This app is really annoying. It automatically plays whatever it was last playing every time the phone connects to a blue tooth device, or, for example, after i listen to a voice message, it will automatically blare from the phone's speaker. I can't find any setting to stop this behavior.   Even when you close the app it still plays all the time, so you have to open the app THEN stop the sound. It's pretty horrible and embarrassing. I had to uninstall it."
"NOPE. Permission to edit anything on any device for a editing app!? No way! This won't even let you open the app unless you give it permission to be able to edit any files on this and any connected devices whenever they want. Why would it ever need that type of full and open access to your files? If you can explain why that is needed without sounding more suspicious, I'll listen but it'll be hard to ignore my common sense voice screaming at me in my head. Saying something like; ""DON'T!!"""
"*edit: review changed from 5 stars to 3 stars and now to 1 After increasingly more bugs which persisted through hard reinstalls and hard rests, I'm u installing after years of using this app exclusively for video. More often than not, it doesn't work. Fails to load videos. Switching apps freezes it until I force stop, clear cache, close, and restart. Sometimes that doesn't work, either. It was nice while it lasted."
"Has annoying features that can't be disabled like swipe controls and a volume boost that doesn't even work and just results in needing to adjust the volume twice as much as normal. The video scrubbing is also very annoying and inaccurate. I'll drag the bar to 30 seconds in, and it'll skip back to 15 or forward to 45. Very annoying, going to switch players."
Ads interfere with use. It plays in the background but when you try to go back to the video to pause an ad pops up. As soon as you close the ad out it goes back to the begining. I was using this to listen to a book and every time I tried to pause it it would restart as soon as I closed out the ad. Uninstalling.
"Made my Razer 2 bug out and lock up after a while. Had to fight to get through the phone's ui and uninstall the app to fix it. It seemed to have trouble seeing my vobs and even then the one out of the 6 it saw played choppy, but the app seemed to play video recorded from the phone fine. It was playing subtitles from the vob file by default, but still impressive that it could access that if I wanted. Can't have it wrecking my phone though."
"I deleted this app because MXPlayer could turn off subtitles... But that player can't do EAC3, so I reinstalled this... I'm really happy ð it plays this format, BUT after asking IN 2019 for subtitles TO GET a button in settings to permanently switch them off, it's not there... So, every episode that contains embedded subtitles needs to be manually switched off... EVERY TIME. 1 Star..."
"Despite what it says, this video player app does not work with Chromecast. I loaded an mp4 video and as it started I clicked on the cast icon and selected the Chromecast indicated. Chromecast opened on the TV and displayed big white letters on a black screen reading ""Video Player All Formats - XPlayer."" Meanwhile, the video kept playing on my tablet and the cast icon indicated it was casting. Useless."
I bought this app thinking its better then the built in app. But when i play a movie file the movie plays very choppy. Its not smooth. Then i try the built in samsung video app and with that app the movie plays smooth. I sent an email to the developer and no response. So i deleted the app. I was hoping i can get a refund. But who knows.
"Repeat mode doesn't work! It still transfers me to the next video after finishing the currently playing one despite enabling Repeat mode and disabling the ""Play Next"" option in the settings! Also, the Downloader is practically useless since it doesn't appear in the list when I tap ""Share"" on any webpage with a video in the browser! Another bug is that when I play a video and then lock the screen and open it again, the audio resumes playing but there is only a black screen instead of the video!"
Make this app simple. Don't complicate it. Start from beginning or resume put this option in setting. Don't show pop-up during playing video. It is very annoying.
"I installed this on my chromebook to play an mkv file, which don't play properly on the default video app. The video played very choppy and the audio just didn't work at all."
"After payment for pro version, it's still showing ads. Saying restore is successful but you are not a member. What's hell the previous payment for lifetime ad-free version?"
"I completely dislike the app just for 2 basic things; the Loop doesn't work properly, it was you to do it manual continuously . it's lock rotate vex me up"
"Please the subtitles need outline or border so they can be visible on white background, changing subtitle color isn't good enough Also the subtitle shadow is far from the letters. Also we need VTT and TXT subtitle function"
"The captions suddenly dissappear after the last update, although i didn't turn them off, and they appear fine on other apps"
It was awesome a while but now i am facing audio sync issue with video .....i compared with other video player audio sync is good but when i run in this player ...audio is not in sync
"When casting a MP4 video there is no sound. The video works fine on my Android or on my computer, but doesn't work for casting which is the whole reason I downloaded this app."
I paid for the remove ads in 2021.. now it says I'm not a xplayer pro member yet.. Dev please help
"I've been using this app since then because it provides better sounds, etc. However, last night I was about to watch videos on my private folder but I was devastated-only to find out that the only videos I've found there was the four clips I had just yesterday. I don't really remember deleting them because I treasure those videos but-hell happens. I don't know. Help me restore it, please. Thank you."
Its got lots of pointless features like superfluous subtitle options and an insistance on playing music in the background no matter how you try to permanently stop it. Plus how do I disable the useless playlist feature? I've got hundreds of folders and it takes ages to hide them all every time I move them around. And it can play videos in landscape but not audio. Is the developer too busy dreaming up pointless features to realise the basic failings of the app
"Any time I open a link or do something to temporarily remove the video like opening tabs, it says ""something wrong with video"" immediately after I come back to it. As in, anytime I press the tab/recent tabs button on my android phone and come back to the video I was watching, rather than continuing from where it stopped, it says ""something wrong with video"" and then gives 2 options (feedback and help). I hope I've explained the situation well. I DIDN'T OPEN A POP-UP WINDOW"
"â EXCELLENT ! = HW/SW Codec(s) compatiblity ð PROS vs CONS ð !!ATTENTION!! â DESTRUCTIVE ! = ð£ Fatal FLAW in Privacy feature(s) WITHOUT WARNING or NOTIFICATION, WILL DELETE ANY & ALL VIDEOS in directory(s) where user initially applied apps privacy feature(s); 1a: to make files ð private, & 1b: lock ð them. I.E. Upon selecting ""UNLOCK"", ALL videos in target container/directory (not [already] locked) will be permanently deleted & no record of the wipe is maintained."
Works great but don't loose signal ur music will fk up. N everytime I try to open playlist it shuts down n returns ta tha hone page. Pretty annoying. Gonna test some other Media players....
"It just stopped and reset my movie to show me a 2 second ad. The app is great but this just completely defeats its function. Why even use this app if it won't actually let me watch anything completely unless I don't touch my phone for the full length of the movie, including breaks? EDIT: Sorry, I've payed to remove the ad. So I can't reproduce the problem myself. Just play a long video, switch to another app, then switch back to this one. Your movie will start over from start (from 00:00:00)"
When I played videos in 2x speed audio quality getting worse in this player Please fix this issue
Complete trash. Wont even show the audios i have downloaded!!!!! Useless
The app is crashed all time while playing songs.
I will give zero star but there is not an option. My movie of 2160p doesn't play in it so this app is waste.
"fix the auto rotation problem while lying and watching video it began to rotate abd spoil the video viewing experience , when lock the screen its not able to moov the pointer"
"Could not test this app because it does not support LAN (you can set an URL, but this has to point directly to a video file. And not a location where your tons of videos are). This app is as stupid as most android stuff: You have sorted all your videos and music clips in hundreds of folders, subfolders and so on.. But in this app all nested folders are reduced to one level of folder hierarchy (videos) or into one single folder for all music clips.. 2000+ files in a single folder, yeah."
"It kept throwing me back to the main app screen after I opened a video, no matter what I did. The ads are also a bit too intrusive for me considering they're planted in-between my files. The rating prompt popped up only seconds after I opened it for the first time, that's a bit too cheeky for my taste. Plus the same prompt kept popping up every second time the app threw me back to the main screen - so I can't help but rate it like this."
The app wasnt bad not at all but listening videos arent the same cuz the audio is a little distorted
Please update this video player because need MP4 video to audio direct play no need convert as vlc player like that
Second time my review has been deleted! Why don't you spend that time actually optimising your app instead of manipulating the reviews! Do it again I'll be writing a report to google. The app stutters and desyncs with the audio on certain videos. It's so bad that it gives me motion sickness. I don't think it handles budget devices well. But I haven't had this issue on any other video player.
"We have the paid app and it's a great program. We use earbuds to watch tv with Video Player and suddenly it won't process the sound to the earbuds. Steps taken: uninstalled app, reinstalled app. Reset Chromecast. Updated app on phones. We can get sound with regular streaming but not with our buds. Consistent on all three tvs, and steps for recovery have been taken on all three sets."
"Cast to TCL TV which is better than it was, but no volume on some videos and slow loading makes it near worthless"
"They updated version n ruined the experience, no more playlist play with looping replay using the casting mode. I uninstalled it , go get another vid player this player has been nerfed. This is to force the user to watch unwanted adds each time you watch a video. It's bad enough to watch 1 or 2 at startup but it's been getting progressively worse."
"Doesn't do the job, when it asked me to rate it, it turned my bad review into an email. So the app doesn't play as many video files as well as vlc or have the ability seek as accurately. Then i check to see if you can control the volume from the chrome cast. They could not. The worst mistake was they asked me to review it and there it is."
"This player messes up my subtitles (doesn't display about 2 to 3 words in any given dialogue) and also delays the subtitles. There is no subtitle synchronisation setting to compensate for the same. And before you say it, yes, I've checked the video and the subtitle files on my inbuilt player and they work just fine, no delay, no word-eat-ups. I will only change the rating if this is fixed. Rest everything is amazing!"
"It loses sound coordination with using screen gesture especially back and forth. You don't have enough control on subtitles like time and size. I don't know exactly what kind of details you need to fix this problem, but as I was watching a video in mkv format, I skipt a part of video then suddenly the audio doesn't match the video. The app was still playing part of audio that I skipted. It looks like only the image was skipted."
Unable to start after upgrade
"I gave the review before i dunno why it gets ignored, this app's subtitle sync was always perfect whether i rewind or fwd the video subtitles would immediately appear but after an update sub sync got ruined. Either they dont appear for 20 seconds or subtitles for a 20 second later time stamp show earlier and i have to repeat those scenes again and again to get subtitles on right time stamp. Subtitle sync is ruined and it by default sets sub size to 20 instead of 15."
"This app is annoying, my private videos suddenly disappeared from its video locker, I hid those videos for a long time and then they suddenly disappeared, how can I recover them? Hello, I looked for what you say is .Private in your Video Player folder, that folder is empty, It's not my smartphone system that deletes my private videos, but your app, I've been using your Apps for a long time and my private vids been locked in there for a long time, then suddenly it was all gone, very disappointing"
"i can't play any video,if i tap any videos it will go directly to my home screen/app drawer and nothing happens, i can play music but video can't.and this new update is such a waste,it is better on v2.1.2.3,this new update video/music folders are missing and it show only videos and music,fix this developer"
"Very few controls, and some of them are not even working, like the subtitle customizations that doesn't remember the settings and varies on different videos. No permanent landscape option. Just a poor attempt at imitating MX Pkayer."
"Another perfect example of a greedy app developer and their ads. Kind of sad actually. Every god damned pause of a video. An ad. Slapped right across the whole picture of what you're trying to view. Absolutely worthless to me and what I do. Sad thing is, is that most app developers for Google play store are the same exact way. Greedy for that ad revenue. Instead of focusing on making a great app. Download at your own risk. Worthless to me. Notorious"
"ð ð  The nice UI is just a glossy coating over a lazy design. Digital artifacting & basic controls only. In Repeat-1 mode, at the start of each cycle; Zoom resets & ALL OSD CONTROLS GO OFFLINE for a period; so when playing a 1-3 sec clip u enter a vicious-circle screen-tapping battle that u r guaranteed to lose. (RE: yes after 4-8 double-taps, if ur timing is perfect (lucky), u might finally pause & regain control; but why has that been good enough for ur Dev's for soooo loooong now?ð¤)"
"I'm already buying it since few years ago. and i love it. but now days there's few bug, like i can't perfectly slide time line while playing videos . example , if i want to skip 10 second video from 00:02 to 00:07 its not work, it usually start playing from 00:02. also while im skiping start playing, skipping short video, theres crashing sound and its loud mate. it's annoying. please fix it..."
Don't know why but in my phone 1 hr video in mx player take 3% battery while xplayer take only 2% . That's fantastic. My problem is with music playing in this app. The equaliser sometime stop working or the song itself stop until equaliser is turned off . Some times videos with subtitles don't show the subtitle even if I turn on the subtitle. I have to once turn it on after opening other video then it work. Also we cant see size of video directly without going to detail
"I'm giving it a 1 star only to grab devs attention. I've been using this app to watching animes I've downloaded. But sometimes, the app shows that some eps have no subtitles. Only after closing the video and playing it again. The subtitles work again. Also, In most animes, more than one character talks in one scene, meaning subs should be displayed for all characters, but the video player shows sub for only one character. Please fix it"
"Ads annoying And thank u for your reply, i will uninstall this app"
"I paid over â¬6 to have ads removed & yet they are not removed. They are merely deactivated but could still be secretly running in the background. â¢||â¢ My premium window displays the following. 1. Remove all ads at once (it doesn't say deactivate all ads at once) 2. Activate all themes 3. No subscription, one-time purchase. â¢||â¢ Why is there still ad code in an application I paid twice the price for? Not to mention it is bloating the app with unnecessary code. (Remove all trace of ads or refund)."
This app will never gain a good rating? It freezes up to many times. So fix it or get rid rid of it. This app was caught being a very poor app about security and security it doesn't have. Malware detected it as a hazard app.. Do to all the problems it has. So fÃ­x the format from sticking an blurring the videos as well. This is posted as warming to google Administration. Should be took off line of products from third parties.
I don't understand why does it start to cast and then tell me cast faild for any video.
"Premium user... I use it mainly for listening to music. A request and bug fix I already asked several times for- I use it mainly for listening music and on the full screen it shows the number of the title, the artist name and then only the first few letters of the title of the song. Why not continuing showing the full title name in another row?! And a suggestion- could you add the option to show music lyrics (like Kodi does via their Lyrics Add-on)? Cheers"
Why am I being asked to install v2.1.7.1 & then have to update to v2.1.7.3 from the playstore? I paid over â¬6 for this application. I expect better premium support than those buying it today at half the price. I also want a completely ad free application. That means removing all ad/s code from the app or creating a premium version separate. I don't care if you say the ads are deactivated. Premium displays full removal for premium members. (I will request a full refund if my demands are not met).
"Go get vlc player, it's free and open source, and probably better! This Requires all files permission, media permission should be sufficient, but no, it acts like it'll work but no, this is a huge red flag. I like how they go so far to tell you how secure an app that has all files access is, how about we just don't need it to use a local video player, unless your selling any data you can get, I guess this is the play store but still, do not give all files access to a random play store app"
"The privacy section in the Google Play store is a joke. It's only for the illusion that Google wants to protect you. This app is clearly lying saying that they do not share data. If you go to the hidden privacy section of this app you will see another hidden setting to deny sharing your data. That is automatically set to ""I agree"" Developers like this app should be exposed for their lies and deceit. But it's up to you to protect yourself because Google won't."
"This app has randomly started importing videos from my folders. I've used an app lock by the same company to protect this app, so something strange is going on. I now don't feel safe using this app and feel Google needs to investigate that they aren't downloading user videos and data from devices that have this app installed."
"Doesn't have options to turn off subtitles by default. Also viewing ads isn't voluntary, they will be shown without consent. Very long loading times compared to other players. Asks you to rate the app 5 seconds after opening it for the first time."
"Deleted the app. Used it to play mov. videos that my official Samsung gallery can't play but it's filled with ads. I get that you need money to develop the app but make it less intrusive. The ads are literally in the middle of the video I'm playing. Everytime I do the slightest thing (pausing, zooming, changing brightness/volume) an ad shows up."
"Why am I NOT receiving the latest update? I paid over â¬6 for this application & I'm not been offered the latest update posted on the 15 Oct 2020 v2.1.9. (I am only been offered v2.1.8.3). I also want to know why there is no export/import option to keep my personal settings. PS, still having ad links even if they are deactivated after paying is NOT cool. Offer a paid ad-free version (which your app clearly states it is but is NOT) & a free ad-infested one. ðððð 0 stars until all is rectified."
"I really love this app, been using it it for months. But when I upgrade my phone, the picture become not sharp, I can literally see the pixels in my 720p video, while my old phone shows sharp same video. I have 720p video and it is not sharp. I can see the pixels and it is rough. Please fix. And keep up the good work, I really like the app"
"been using this 1 year, and buy premium edition. lately i have problem with scan device feature. this app cant find new folder video that i have copy to my device. stuck on loading searching icon. i have compare it to another app like, 'mx player', 'vq player', and these two app dont have any problem with scanning device feature."
"I have problem with the app. Everytime i fast forward or seek in a video, the video will go black and looks like a glitch. This players is also can't play 60fps video smoothly. I try to play the same video with other player and it play it smoother. This player also can't play webm video which kinda bad. I use this player because it has good subtitle setting so please fix this problem."
"Worked fine until the update. Now, whenever I try to play a video, a notification pops up saying ""unsupported device."" I'm using an Acer tablet, and up until this point, I haven't had any problems with the app. I am quite disappointed, because this app has been the best video player I've used."
"Has been a great player but for some reason, this app refuses to close in the background. I have the app in sleep or deep sleep to conserve battery but the app is the only thing still running when the app should be off. Drained 20% and the night before 40% of battery. Yes, I close all my apps and clean my ram before sleeping. Yes, I restarted and power cycle my phone. I haven't opened the app for 1 week."
"The ads have become too much, the app has disabled the back function of the phone, I now have to close the ad from the x button. Ok, uninstalling then, there are a lot of players that are less intrusive with the ads."
"Ads pop up every few seconds...cannot even watch the video since the ads pop up in the center of the screen. Response to developer: literally cannot be used with the way and frequency the ads pop up so how do you ""enjoy the app""? Even the response to the review is unusable. LOL"
"* Can't play mp4 file - The app suddenly stops after a few minutes since we start playing the video.... * Too much time to load files I'm exhaustedð©!!!!! @#*Please fix it ð¨ð§*#@ Please bcuz I like this player more than any other player....... {(But the oldest versions were very fast.... Why update?...... Except for the new features, the oldest versions are better.. )} The crash doesn't occur for all videos only for some videos but the video works fine with default player Mi Video Player Or MX"
"Laggy when connect to Bluetooth headphones. I am using sony Ch500 Bluetooth headset. But sound is not synchronizing properly. Its becoming slightly laggy and when I am fast-forwarding it, it is becoming slow at first then video is playing smoothly but sound is slightly lagging behind the video. It is not the problem with my Bluetooth Device. I have used the same Bluetooth headphone with MX player then it has not that problem. It is with X player only. So I suggest you to fix the issue soon."
"I really like this player and bought it to disable ads. BUT when I use it, even in background it drains my battery too fast on my Galaxy Note 9. From 100% to 60% - 40 mins in background!!! when I just listen music. Will change my mind when you fix this issue."
"The app itself is cool, the problem is, they show ads, videos based ads which use your mobile data. I can understand ads for free version but videos ads use lots of data and may cost more in the long run. The second problem, it scans folders containing .nomedias or .noscan files."
"Says it will play m4v, doesn't. Answer to dev. Uninstalled it bec already happy with normal media player. Just wanted to be able to watch one iTunes video (an ep of a BBC series which is damaged on my dvd!) The video was visible from the directory. Opened the player, looked for vid, selected it, there was popping noise, black screen but player operating. Video bought officially as it were, works perfectly on PC. Just hoped to watch it on my tablet (Android 7, plenty of memory etc). HTH"
I used this app so long time .but recently when I updated this last time ..it was not playing video better anymore. When I see a video suddenly it's stop to showing video ..when I click over the video again that will stop and not playing video ..too much annoying for me ..please solve this issue as soon as possible
"cold application start is painfully slow, also a unified folder management system for both audio and video files like MXplayer wold be more convenient and less confusing. lastly the share button which is used very often should not be embed in menu. unluckily this player is inferior to mxplayer, unistalled. another reason is that file opened from 3rd party file manager won't enqueue others files in same folder unlike mxplayer."
"I got this specifically to play MP4 files. But it won't even allow me to select the files. It just lists a few other video files, but there doesn't seem to be any way to select the files i want, which aren't among the half dozen listed. Uninstall."
Horizontal and Verticle videos do not get played accordingly automatically. You have to select rotate and then it gets played that way. So next video H or V gets played in same selected option as earlier. When you pause video the ads get displayed. That is highly irritating. So gave 1 rating. I uninstalled immediately.
Found the app very good except for one issue that spoils everything. Ads after playing media. I don't mind ads. i understand that they are necessary for the developers. However almost all ads have high volume sounds. My earbuds have been blasted like Team Rocket after a Pikachu thunderbolt. Fix this issue for 5 Stars.
Have been using the free version of this app for awhile and it was great for streaming mp4 video to my chromecast device. Upgraded to the paid version and now will not stream anything. Not even the same videos that were working perfectly before. Why?
I really like the app but the apps got too much ads which is very annoying and also the interface of the app needs to be improved. It looks outdated. Fixing both of the problem stated above will improve the app a lot in the long term.
"unable to auto detect and load the srt subtitle file located in the same folder with the same file name as the video file. l have to select the srt file manually every time I play a video. After manually selecting the srt file, it still doesn't display the subtitle. l don't know what the problem is. VLC player is able to do all I mentioned here."
Dont bother trying to watch hd videos on this! It cant keep up on screen refresh rate and will play the audio out of sync with the video! Waste of time. I went with Vlc and didnt have any problems with refresh rate and it was free too...
"I have the paid version. Background play is broken and extremely stupid how you have to pick ""play background"" settings every single time. It should be like that forever once picked but I have to do this every single time."
This is advertised all over Google as being able to change the quality on sms message videos from iPhone users to Android users. Which it doesn't it at least I didn't find anything substantiating these claims. If I'm wrong the devs could contact me and I will gladly change this review. Thank you
"Only way to repeat current selection is if you are in a playlist. Again, lack of control and playback options. Repeat should be a standard playback option, even in the buttons. AB playback is not the same thing."
"When we lock the screen,it pops up 2 locks in the bottom of each side of the screen. what the hell? I've seen first time in any video player where 2 locks pop up to unlock the screen lol. Giving it 1 star. Let me know when u fix this.. I'll give it 5 stars because I've been using this player from 1 year and it's been amazing but with last update,u just made me delete this app."
"Was looking for a lightweight video player to replace VLC, and this ain't it chief. First, what completely kills this app for me is that this app has its own brightness setting!?? So if you adjust your phone's brightness to 25%, this app will still have it at 100%! This complicated and unnecessary feature is non-negotiable, so if you don't like it. Too bad! I deleted the app right after that."
"The app refuses to function at all if you deny permission to local storage. This is garbage because I don't want to use your media browser. I have my own file explorer and gallery app, I just want a video player to play videos that I've launched externally."
It was the best for me but not anymore. I used to play music on this app ;the app did an amazing job. But now the sound starts to lagging when the phone display turned off (screen timed out). Please fix this.
"a great app,but I'm having few problem,first the app keep the video playback,you couldn't turn it off, that's quite irritating in some cases,second somehow if you download dood video from firefox,it automatically throw you to this app then just error,so you need to copy the link,paste it in chrom,then download it."
"This latest update has some bugs. I can't play .mkv video format. It is showing an error ""Something wrong with this video"". Also I am getting same problem for .ts and .mkv video format in Network Stream play. Please fix the issue or tell me how to get the previous version."
"Horrendous, artifacts appearing all over the screen from dvd/blu-ray dumps that I took direct from my own discs including brand new ones. Same applies to all c9dec formats I tried. The only + I can give this is usability as it has similar functions to VLC Player but that is also free to download and doesn't have ads"
PIP mode doesn't play back properly with most videos. The video will play but flickers and distorts. I used the paid version. I wrote them about a resolution but never got a response. Uninstalled it and replaced with MX Player which is working well.
"This app was once very okay,but since I started updating it's just as useless as anything,now the option to stop playing next video is not just working even after multiple updates and reinstalling.... this is so annoying,....0 stars"
"No it sure why the rating is so high .. 1 star because there is no way to view directory structure. Just lumps everything into Video or Audio, then you have to search the lists the app creates instead of the organized folders you may have created yourself in your file system. Also... no way is this a free app (unless you want to stare at ads all day while you listen to music or watch videos. Do yourself a favor and go download VLC instead."
"After the update, I am unable to stream any video online. It shows ""Unsupported File"". I've been regularly using this app, but now it sucks. I tried other links as well but everytime it appears as unsupported file. PATHETIC!"
Frustrating app to use as it says a goal and then removes it even when the goal was never going to stand I. E offside. If you're going to promote live scores at least show correct information instead of jumping the gun and then editing the score all the time!!!! Many matches have incorrect stats - corners!!!! Useless information until its amended. This used to be my go to app but whoever runs it now is not on the ball... Overall extremely Disappointing. 1/5 if I could give 0 i absolutely would.
"Used to be best app for results and stats for me. Recent update made it unusable. Tried to reinstall it but didn't help. App crashes every 30 seconds. Forced to use the web version. Fix it ASAP please. 4 months after reviewed. It's nearly May nothings changed. App keeps crashing can you please fix it? If I'm in Live games and I scroll down to find a game the app freezes and crashes. Happens constantly, on android Pixel 7 pro! Please fix it"
"You want users to accept a new privacy policy and terms of use, but when clicking to view them, it says that the request cannot be completed. So I can either blindly accept them or delete the account. What about outlining what the changes are? Until you fix this issue, I can't use your app. I think you didn't bother to read my review. Clicking in the updated policy links generated an error message so I cannot see what you have changed."
"I loved the older version, clean and easy to navigate but latest update has changed layout, way too busy now, this new linear style apps have now rather than folders is just an excuse to riddle the content with adverts for gambling, half the screen taken up with them. Definitely lost an avid fan,"
well at this moment awful... keeps stopping not loading need to find another similar app. been very good till last couple of months shame..you need to sort this out...infuriating!!! update!!! 2hours later after trying to follow important scores tonight have finaly come to conclusion ::::this app is now totaly annoying and useless.. have avoided say ing all night....RUBBISH..goodby ð¤¬
"You are currently failing to manage your success. Many of the fields in the statistics are no more displayed in many matches eg Total Passes, Tackles etc. There is no more consistency as to what is to be displayed. This is very disappointing"
"This used to be a great app, easy to use, very informative and looked cool. Now, cluttered screen, keeps reloading, it's a pain. It wasn't broken so why ""fix it"""
"Keeps crashing. Edit: thanks for the update, will revert to 5 stars when fixed. Edit 2: seems to be fixed now. Edit 3: back to crashing all the time (05/23)."
Need to change the goal difference column to a value. Instead of goals for and against. No one wants to sit and work out each teams goal difference. Maybe have the goals for and against in horizontal view
Too many goals later corrected as not being goals. Better to wait until goals are confirmed. So annoying when you think a bet has won for a new notification to come 5 mins later. Happened again with Rio Avenue goal 17/03 / then suddenly taken off as a missed penalty. Either it was in or not?
"Really unintuitive design, worse than the website. Why can't I automatically see the games, but have to open the league or the all games panel. And why don't basketball games have stats, except points, rebounds and assists? Oh yeah, there are no kit numbers for substitutes, so good luck trying to look up a player while watching the game."
when u have a bad connection there will be NO update until the ads are loaded. Please change your priorities of what to load first. In some countries there are plenty of spots with bad connections...
This app is not working right because it doesn't give you the right position on the golf leaderboard and on the n.b.a basketball it doesn't give you the right up-to-date with players scores
"Notification is really bad. When scores update, it didn't have any effect."
The only and big problem with this app is that the odds are not longer steady and and that's why it can't become one of the best apps.
"App is rubbish. Flashes up that a team scores, then 3 minutes later flashes again that it's a mistake. Would recommend not using this app."
"A very interesting application, with ease of use!! The graphics and design are very okay. However there are some things which do not add up and that's why I have rated one star! 1. Why don't we see the lines of some matches like Kenya, does it mean the support have insufficient data for it? 2. Why don't we see the substitutes, yellow cards or the full progress of Kenyan matches, does that mean flashscore underated Kenya or what? More than 1M Kenyans we will give it one star ðððððððððð"
"Love the app hate the adds. Now unable to use as it will not open, I have reinstalled but still will not open on my Android phone hence the 1 star any suggestions welcomed"
"Good app but could do with alot of improvement. Example other apps show batting scorecard in cricket, this app just the score."
Loved them app and had no issues but unable to open app since updating software and app on pixel 7A
My fav app but since I got a new pixel 7 pro phone keeps freezing and knocking off frustrating doing my head in have uninstalled and reinstalled too no affect
App should open on live scores. Have to click TWICE to see them and its not that quick either. Sorry!
"I was obnoxiously forced to install this app to replace the perfectly functional FlashScoreUK app. The text on this one is far too big, which reduces the amount of information on the screen at any time. There is also much less in the way of thick lines to make clear distinctions between separate games, players or other pieces of information. I will be searching for an alternative."
Crashes incredibly frequently to the point that I've started using other apps wherever possible
"It's user friendly. I love it, it helps me in forecasting game and it gives me an update on the football clubs which helps a lot in sport betting"
It's a good app but sometimes the scores presented are not correct.
"am not happy with the app any more, you guys made update and the new update keep hanging up my phone, this is not good."
"good app but they removed odds, some matches has but most of them not, for example tennis itf league"
Hello flashscore. This is the worst change ever. I love flashscore because of its simplicity. Whoever thought about changing it is not smart at all. But the design is OK. Unfortunately I don't use the app for design but rather it's ease of use. Now it's hard to use. Colours are beautiful but distractive. Yack. Now I can't focus on my analysis. Flashscore should be about usability not Colours and all that stuff. That stuff is meaningless. Kindly make the previous versions usable so I downgrade.
"App is normal, but sometime you guys give a terribly wrong live results. Deserve maximum 1 star."
"Oh blindness of the great! It's always good to make changes trying new things but for this, it's a terrible failure. The move you people just made is a reverse one. I mean this ought to have been an a 10 years back update. You just took us back with this change, the app is not any user friendly. For the Graphical User Interface, it's amazing. The rest is just boring take us back to the recent one. You really overlooked HCI concept. We can nolonger efficiently do matches analysis."
"I spent the whole week preparing my favorite games matches and they just disappeared when I have to start betting the pain ,soccer24 never betrayed me"
For some reason everytime i enter application all sounds on my phone get 20-30% more silent. Dont know if its a bug or its meant to do that. I await your response.
The font size is too big it makes it difficult to identify at a glance and i suggest each game should be colour marked for easy identification of home and away matches
"The worst app for sports scores. It is okay for football, but forthe other sports is terrible. Right now for snooker shoout out they are playing the final, but there is not even a score for the semi finals"
"Inconsistent and unreliable. This app, for example, when it's supposed to update the score live, often updates the goals scored in the first half together with the notification alarming the end of the match. So if you need to closely follow the game relying on the notifications while you are working, look elsewhere. Update: I know the difference between FRO games and normal games. I was talking about normal games when I wrote the above review."
"Edit: I will adjust my rating when you will deal with the painful amount of ads, i wouldn't mind to pay for a premium ads-free version. For 5 stars you will have to bring also match graphs like the other better apps have: SofaScore, AI Score, Bee Sports. Looking forward to changes that will actually be useful. New identity but still full of ads resulting in a terrible user experience. Look for ""Bee Sports"" instead, that app has decent ads and moreover shows useful graphs on every match."
The format of h2h is terrible. The one for the older version was far much better... Also odd format was better in decimals than fractions...
It shows all sports results and live score it's good app
"Flash score was running great, until one of the updates, that conflicts with WiFi. You have to re-boot the phone to get flash score to work. This error massage that says "" something went wrong"" it's annoying bug. It's a nightmare for a phone that automatically connects to Wi-Fi if signal is strong.. Just fix that bug and make flash score great again."
Was a good app but is now utter garbage. When I choose add a match to favourites it also adds other matches at a later date..
"The new design is straight trash. Colors are way too poppy, even in dark mode, is truly uncomfortable to look at. The thing they're replying about ""getting used to"" is major bs, you shouldn't have to get used to something that's uncomfortable for your eyes, anyway, get a new design team. What's up with sizing up stuff all around? Things that used to fit in my screen now requiere me to scroll, such as a 6 games tennis set, or the h2h section of tennis. Trying to find an old version..."
"The app version is different from the Web version especially when it comes to the basketball sport. They need to make the app like the Web version. To be more specific, things like rebounds, assists and points of players in basketball game"
Well today I deleted this app simply because I was focused on the match between Tunisia(my country) and France and it said that the match ended with a draw with a goal in the 98 minute while it really ended with a win for Tunisia . The point is this is a match in the world cup the biggest competition in football it has to give me the right result to gard their credibility at least.
Can't you just update the scores and position of your golf leaderboards
Hello! We appreciate your good work on sports statistics particularly in football. Honestly I beg you to back to older version and add to it speed and what you think good without changing it's appearance. I have uninstalled the new version and received an order version to someone who often neglecting to update the older version and again I started enjoying your app while I neglecting to update it. Worrying to back to new version again after update.
"Some of the games have already started and already half time but it still shows on the app that game hasn't started yet. Some other games have finished playing but it's showing halftime. This app isn't just good at all. At least fix it or revert to the old version. It doesn't update games on time. I'm comsiding uninstalling it because this isn't an upgrade at all, it's Just a downgrade. It is"
App constantly crashes! Is it too much to ask for an app to work for more than 5 minutes at a time
"I would have given it a five, the new format in landscape, makes it less interesting, one is interested or concentrate on one sport at a time. The sports listed on the left hand side reduces the space and the number of games that displayed on the left while you check the performances."
"Could be the best live scores app, but your server connection is so trash. Usual sutuation I cant just run it and this is not my internet connection fault. Loading any player profiles or match pages sometimes are endless, but if I just take step back to previous page and try to load again it will load almost instantly, but not always. Also always see fake scores in tennis, as often so I dont even believe your score info anymore. The only thing is working good are ad banners"
Amazing ilike ððððð easy to use
"I've used this App for years now and I normally choose my games and they would show without mixing with my teams. Please allow me to move back to the old setup. This new setup is irritating, even selecting a game from the list of ""my teams"" is now a hustle becasue the ""star"" is removed on the side. If its not broken do not fix it!"
"Please, delay several seconds the push notifications. It is very unpleasant to see on the phone that the tennis match is over, or the set, and you to still watch it on tv. TV has a little delay. So your solution is not to use your app instead of 3 seconds delay? Lol."
"Thanks to this new all I have stayed clean from betting for the last few days. What an unexpected wonderful therapy! Such a turn off! While you have added a few easy to access options, the interface is generally awful! But keep it the way it is at present cos I am praying I complete my betting addiction successfully!"
Very good app but try to show more livecores pls
"It is terrible, i removed it, Sometimes I don't get notifications and sometimes the scores are not live, I get it delayed. And in the past few months, I am not able to access it, it say all the time no internet connection, when I am certain there is a connection. Don't recommend it at all."
"Goal notifications coming in a minute or 2 late....uninstalling until it's fixed....sorryð¤¦ð¾ââï¸ PS: The app isn't optimized on my device. I'm thrilled with the new look but this bug is really frustrating... Okay, so I decided to give a shot it again today (8/8/22). Just to see if the issues I reported about has been resolved."
Was a great app until I updated it absolutely shocking delays on notifications I've tried deleting it and reinstalling but still not working correctly possibly best to avoid until they've smoothed out the issues. Now 21 days in and notifications come through willy nilly eg. Goal notifications after matches have finished etc please can you sort this out
"You've completely messed up the ""my games"" section by merging it with ""my team""... It takes hours to load when on mobile data and sometumes even fail to load, because it has to load both sections at once before presenting you results... This app has bexome difficult now... Revert it to how it was!!! I wish there was a zero star"
"After the forced change of the app installed I'm encountering nothing but issues. Last couple of weeks is the worst, I cannot load any scores, app loads infinitely. Earlier it helped to kill the app from recent apps, but now even that doesn't help. Reinstalling and clearing app data and cache didn't work either. Fix your app!"
"There's something wrong with ball possession, I don't know if it's on purpose or not, but I noticed that few times. Last night I watched a soccer match and definetely possession was way superior for that team but on flashscore was only 51%, I checked on livescore as well and I was right 68%."
"I have uninstalled the new app... Had the old one backed up somewhere, so I installed it back. The new app is way off... NOT user friendly, colour-wise, handling-wise, appearance-wise, otherwise. Everything is everywhere... No basic sense of direction. What was the need for a new app? Did 'we' customers complain about anything? Do yourselves a favour and get back the features (i.e Looks, colour choice and handling) from the old app or you may just be losing your customers in huge sum..ð¤·ð½ââï¸"
for the second time in 2 months this app used all my data in one night when i was asleep without it running in the background or updating. i tried to contact flashscore for help but they are not responding. unfortunately have to delete the app and advise others to do so aswell to prevent this from happening again. shame since i really like the content of the app
Not getting notifications sent through most of the time and when I do get a goal notification it's about an hour after the game has finished. App has gone completely downhill in recent times. Needs fixed ASAP!
"The previous version of this app was so cute and simple until the emergence of this 02-02-2022 version. The reason why I gave one star is that, checking HTH of teams were diagonal but now it's vertical. This app has now gone away from the reason why I chose it over other sports apps, I beg bring back the old version especially the HTH checking style. This app is the best I ever see though."
The latest update is erratic. The display is now different from the older version. You can nolonger distinguish between a home team and the away team. It is confusing. The older version's display was top notch and easy to use.
At a slow connection this app wouldn't connect at all and said no connection while other app still load even though takes some time. The app is getting heavier to load compare to the old one. This app should faster from each version but it is the opposite of it.
Something bad after the last update. The apps getting slower to open. Look like the apps getting full with some ads or unneccessary additional function making it slower to load. Sometime so frustrated to open the apps. Getting an hour to load. Please check your apps before many of us find another apps to enjoy our live sport result. ð ð ð ð ð 
"matches take forever to load,lost a huge live bet because of it ,the interface and how everything is organised is simple and good but my four other stars only count for speed,it needs to open matches in a fraction of an instant,had me waiting a thousand years for the match details to open to realise the betting company rigged things up!!"
Sofascore overtook you because 1. There is chat interactive menu for users in every match. 2. Your stats are scruid and incorrect which will normally change later after match has long ended. Your stats for example in total SHOTS in football are normally fake and changes later or may not change!
Reliable and user friendly
"You guys chose aesthetics over usability, doing analysis is so hard now. The head go head part of the previous version was much better. Sadly if you somehow manage to convince yourself that this is a better version than the previous one, then congratulations, you fooled yourself successfully. This is really sad, you have no idea how useful your app was."
This app used to be fantastic until the last update now it sucks worse than a toddler. The interface is trash and difficult to scroll through as you're bombarded with irrelevant football division. Please switch back to the older version or I'm deleting this trash for another Livescore app.
"I hate this your new version with a passion. Are you working for the bookies or giving score freely, because I cannot understand why you are making it difficult for us to use the app or webpage to read games. You have made it take more space that it used to. I prefer the older version. This version sucks. It is irritating. I don't like the User interface one bit. I don't know why the stupid upgrade. I prefer when both teams in comparison are in one line. I hate it now in block form"
"Maybe let customers choose which leagues they would like to view or save instead of forcing them into seeing every single league game when opening up the app, seriously!... there are way too many and even more so at weekends So once we have the choice to select which leagues we wish to view, then and only then will l change my 1 ð for 5 ð s"
"Simple ,sufficient easy accessible"
"I find it difficult to use this latest Flashscore,do to the fact that, after two three days of installation, it will just stop working, and when I tried to open it, it will not open... I will have to uninstall it, and download another one again.. Please u guys should do something about this."
"Can you please bring back the the favorites trash can please. I only used this as it had this. After keeping an eye on multiple games, sometimes over a 100 in a day, the last thing I would like to do, is to delete them one by one. It's very tidious. Do this and you have a 5 star. Thank you."
"Don't know what you've done to this app but since latest update won't even load, says no Internet connection. Strange as I can stream video in HD with my 80mb fibre broadband. Used to be the best scores app out there totally useless now."
"Hello!! Developer!! I was using your app for statistics and scores but the reason I stopped is that you only provide few dates of previous matches days,so try to provide all the previous matches dates.When this problem is being solved,I will be back to use your app and all the guys will enjoy that feature!!Thank you."
App takes long long time to start. It's very poor app as regards it's running.
Never used to have a problem now it is crashing all the time?
Very very easy to access.... The stats are excellent
Details of cricket matches other than India are not displayed.only summary is displayed
"This latest update is useless. Stop making updates if you guys don't know what to do, always ruining a working app with stupid updates ð¡ð¡ð¡"
"Absolutely good,coz it has all football statistics"
Best Football app. Wide coverage and good profile history of individual player's
Used to be ok but now I can't even get the home screen to load.
"I like it, flashscore is my best scoccer result checker."
It cant open on my device after installing the app.
keeps crashing on the Google pixel 7
"Why throwing is not available in today match again, it seem this your don't want to function again , please work on this before it condemn"
Where's the old app? This is very confusing and useless
too late and Long time loading
Nice and easy to use.
Very good app with good scores
"Everytime I try to open the app it says ""sorry this app is no longer supported"". I have to go to the app store and open it there, my app is updated and I have uninstall and reinstalled but no joy. I've had this app for years but this will be the end if not fixed."
"worst app ever! first of all, it was perfect like it was before the major update that changed colors from green to this abomination of Red and Black. second, i already had the flashscore app installed yet half of the screen announce to ""install the app"" so I clicked the banner and i was shocked to see there is another app with the same name and same utility. for this reasons i feel obligated to search for another app that respect their users."
Rubbish. Slow and every update makes it worse
"This one is boring, we need old version please bring it back and why change even though I need, you consult the customer first, am totally disappointed and honestly I don't want this app anymore, maybe you people should probably have provided two apps at a time this one and the old version app please help us, those who are interested in the old should go for the old one and those interested in the new should go for the new one, please you people should consider our rights and desire as customers"
"I used to love Outlook but now there are adds at the top of my folders and after using outlook for most of my adult life I am now being pressured to pay for more storage or else I can't send or receive emails. I will definitely be looking for a better email platform because this is ridiculous, ten plus years of having an account with them and storage has never been an issue but now, they only give you a small amount of storage for free otherwise you have to pay."
"May 9 2023 error loading message again is displaying... after another update. Oct 7 2022 I have multiple accounts connected and when I go to ""all"" it only shows one and not the rest as it has done previously and sometimes no emails at all. I now cannot even open any messages and get an ""error loading message"" notice so the ap is essentially useless because if that. I cannot move items to folders, it shows like they move but when I refresh, they reappear."
Absolute slop. MSFT has thrown away basic QA for new features that just get underfoot. You cannot copy a physical location in a meeting. So if you're in a foreign country you cant just copy the location for your taxi or ride app. Ive had to reinstall it twice. Notifications show up - sometimes. Theres no longer a direct help link. I wonder why. So frustrating that an app with a simple function can no longer do the basics.
"I got this app in order to sync my calendar to my main calendar, so I can see both work and personal calendars in one app. It would be great, except that the setting to ""sync calendars"" turns off every few days. Such a simple bug, and yet it ruins the whole experience. Microsoft is ignoring the open thread on the issue."
"The search algorithm is by far the worst I've seen in my 25+ years in IT. It randomly takes a long time to get messages sometimes (regardless of internet connection quality), starred messages don't actually show in the starred messages folder and the way they handle aliases from merged Hotmail account is horrible too. World love to not have to touch Outlook app on my phone."
"This app is awful at filtering junk mail, to the point that I got confused and clicked on a phishing email. Since then it has gotten worse. Also this app is only prompt with sending emails when it wants to. I was trying to log into an account that INSISTED I verify by email and it would not send for a full 10 minutes. Don't depend on this app! It is awful."
"*Since last update app crashes 20 to 30 seconds after I open it. **Since last update, i have not been able to sync my calendar with my calendar for work (office 365). Also, the app keeps shutting down for no apparent reason, I'll be in the process of checking emails, and the app closes without warning."
"I would rate 0 stars if I could, this is the worst email app on the internet. It sends invites from Microsoft teams to my deleted folder...it doesn't even recognize other programs from the same company, it doesn't let me download image attachments if someone else has replied to the thread before I downloaded them. Gmail does everything outlook can do only better and easier and it comes pre installed on Android, if you don't have to use outlook for work use literally any other email service."
"Not sure what has changed, but the perf on this app has been horrendous in the last few weeks. Opening an email sometimes takes so long my phone screen turns off. Contacting support, that just loads and loads and loads. I get notifications from my phone that the app isn't responding, asking if I want to continue to wait. I've been using this app for years. Something is broken and needs fixing. On a high end Samsung device..."
"Update: I don't know why, but it now deletes every email I open when I try to go back to my inbox. Every one, every time! I didn't change my settings, it started doing this on its own. Right now, Outlook is basically useless and unless I can figure out a solution I may have to move to Gmail. I've used it for years and it does everything I want. I much prefer it to Gmail. Mostly intuitive, easy to use folders, easy email creation, useful updates."
"On the new Samsung Tab S8+ when using the outlook app it has some serious issues with email filing.  1.) When swiping on the email left or right depending on how you have your swipe features set, it will randomly put the email in a random folder. Not consistent. 2.) When you click the folder to file it in, it jumps from Focused, to Other every time almost without cause. Then you have to click back in to Focused for no reason.   I can provide screen recordings of this happening if needed."
"My work calendar disappears DAILY. The last 2 weeks, my calendar keeps being removed and the only way to fix is perform a 'reset account' within the Outlook app. It happens multiple times a day. I've tried deleting my account and readding it, I've even tried deleting the app and reinstalling it, and it took less than 2 hours for my calendar to disappear again. I may have to stop using it because when the calendar disappears, I no longer get any meeting alerts which makes the app useless"
"Outlook now has ads that cannot be removed. I recieve 1,100+ emails a day, and the ads are IN ADDITION TO the spam and phishing I have to weed through. The app constantly crashes when sending emails. It also does not recognize email addresses when doing forwarding so I have to add them manually a few characters at a time. If you haven't moved to Outlook email yet, don't."
"App keeps crashing. Emails won't open. Cleared cache, didn't help. Uninstaller and reinstalled. Didn't help. Works fine on my pc, but I need access when I am not near my pc. This is not acceptable! Fix this! Samsung is sending me a message to put Outlook into a deep sleep because it is continuing to crash. This needs to be fixed. I tried to contact support, but no one answered me."
I don't know what they did but the spam filters aren't working properly since January. It doesn't matter if I use the app or webmail. I've had this account for many years but it's so bad I'm thinking of switching and of course you can't find anywhere to report it. Others have bitched about it in different forums. There's no feedback option in webmail or on the app. Don't download this until they fix it.
"This app used to me by go to for every email account since I could combine everything into one app. For the past 2 to 3 months, I have been receiving 0 emails through the Outlook app for 1 of my email addresses that works in the native Gmail app. No changes have been made to the settings, and no warnings or pop-ups have appeared that changes are required. I am very disappointed with whatever changes have been made on this app recently."
"Microsoft needs to study Android. This is for the Android app, not the Windows version. This app has limited functionality compared to other similar apps. This app does not display the entire thread of an email conversation, only a few recent entries. I have to forward a thread to my Gmail account to read it. Down to one star, Microsoft. Cannot easily edit a misspelled address. This app is horrible."
"No search function. The app failed about 8 months ago when an update was installed. I have created a ticket on this, and Microsoft said they were aware of the issue and wo rking on it. As of this post, it still does not work, and if you depend on outlook mail app as I do, be aware of this issue. As much as people use the service for work, this function is critical."
"It used to work fine but now it crashes every time I use it. It immediately says ""no sender"" under all my emails on the left and then crashes. I tried to email the developer but of course, it's a ""noreply"" email address so there's that. I use this for work so this is a critical error! I can access it on Chrome but the app itself will not work."
"Edit: It's been almost a month now and this problem it still occurring. I am VERY UPSET because I'm am not getting my notifications for my appointments! I will be looking into transferring my calendar to another program. Since the latest update, my calendar stops syncing with my phone. I have the settings turned on in the app and have reset the settings. But the sync will later turn itself off and I will miss important reminders of upcoming appointments."
"Get ready to pay for your email service if you use outlook. Its free in the beginning, but once you become reliant on it they lock your account and keep it locked until you pay for a subscription. Be warned, its all leading to a monthly subscription. Oh, and there are ads now. And you can't remove them unless you pay an ADDITIONAL fee."
"The app rarely works correctly and freezes most of the time. The Zoom and Teams function within the calendar invite never works and times out. I'll receive notifications that I have new emails, and once I go into the app to read the messages, there aren't there. I have to wait about 10 minutes for them to show within the messages. This app has been a pain for the past year or two. I would expect greatness from this company, and it has been lackluster, to say the least."
Microsoft has had issues for years (literally years) with their apps not syncing reliably. And don't even try to use their wear OS watch face. It literally never works. I've tried it with multiple phones and watches over 5 years and if I'm lucky enough to get it to work it usually spontaneously stops after a few days. How on earth can such a large company make software this unreliable?
"Pathetic!!! It remained archaic and dysfunctional for many years. Search NEVER worked. Contacts NEVER worked. Sending email NEVER worked. Loading new messages is problematic. Freezes up. It is totally pathetic and worthless. Why do the Outlook developers still have jobs? This is an email app that belongs in 1995, not 2023. Little effort has gone into Outlook. It is the most useless app or tool on the planet. It literally does not function."
"It's ok, but you don't have a choice. It's buggy sometimes, and once in a while, it'll just delete stuff, like drafts you started on a PC. Other times, you delete things, but they don't actually go away. Oh... Still no way to print emails. People have asking for this feature almost a decade now."
"Terrible spam filtering. Used Hotmail for 20+ years, had a whitelist while they were figuring out how to stop spam, then went back to a blacklist when they did figure it out, and it's worked fine for years. But in the last few months, filtering has stopped. Floods of obvious spam with non-ASCII characters go to the Focused inbox. Forced to whitelist again (through browser because you can't in the app). Also adds an unremovable Bing option to my browser content menu. Incredibly aggravating."
"I've been using this app for years and never had any complaints, until they added ads?! Now my inbox is lovingly topped with an ad every time I open it. Usually the ad pops up right as I'm about to open the top email too, which is great! Microsoft, Why?.. Like actually, why? Is this seriously the business model? Do I need a subscription to access my email ad free? I have enough junk in there as it is, I don't need your ads too."
"This is one of those ""only reviewing it because I have a problem with it"" reviews. I can't find the IMAP account settings. I have two options, reset or delete, not change server settings. (If the change server settings are not there, then they should be easier to find.) Why??? To not confuse people? I guess if this app does not cater toward power users, then I will have to look to an app that does."
"Junk keeps getting in my inbox when it's blocked, reported as junk, and phishing. Already contacted support and all I'm told is look at this guide like I haven't been looking and trying already. Hope they don't mind losing ad revenue, because their own system is flagging Microsoft product emails even when I manually put it in as a ""safe"" sender..... Please fix this I used to love the app till the last few updates with barely any of the actual issues being fixed."
Started not receiving emails last couple of days. I got notifications of new emails but clicking on them did not show the content. The emails stopped syncing following this issue. Add/remove account or reset doesn't fix. Clearing cache doesn't fix. I had to do a full reinstall but issue came back after about 10 hours. Email is the CORE purpose of this app. My company forces me to use Outlook and now I cannot work off my phone. More people below reporting this problem. MS PLEASE FIX IT ASAP!
"Review is based on previous versions before updating today: Often I'm working hard to word something carefully before I send something, pause to talk to someone in the room before holding up the phone again to proof read, add more, etc and all my previous composition has vanished. Very frustrating. I've seen it happen 3 times in a row on a single email. Recently, I wondered if it was triggered by my screen auto rotating. Text was there, lowered my hand, raised it back, saw rotation, gone."
"The last few weeks this app started freezing randomly but mostly when opening emails. I also believe this is related to the sudden extreme battery drain on my phone. And, lastly, Outlook is created thousands of duplicate contacts in the Android Contacts app ... just in the last hour about 950 new duplicates were added."
"I'm downgrading my review to 1 star due to the Developer contact email being a noreply address... Really?? That's what you think of us? Also, doesn't live up to the Outlook name by any measure. Search, especially if for Contacts, is a joke; alert options in Calendar are limited to 4 choices, and the alarm can't be set to be heard on a phone in a pocket or purse. Looks like it was developed as a summer intern project rather than a serious business tool."
"After 30 years of satisfaction with Microsoft's email service, my opinion of it has taken a nose dive. My inbox stays full of phishing attempts. The emails are from similar or even the same emails that I constantly keep blocking. I reached out to the web version and they said that they don't know why they keep coming through but they couldn't help. They said I had to contact the developers of the app. I've emailed them and never got a response. I'm reevaluating my use of any Microsoft products.."
"Keeps making UI changes so people can justify their jobs. No idea why, but suddenly the + for a new email has become a pop-up list. One press has become 2 presses. I'm sure I'm not the only one who doesn't use the calendar, teams, etc. Also wants to archive from the notification when I want to mark an email as read instead. Update: now it tries to push you to the Edge browser. Looks like it's time to uninstall it."
"As many have stated recently, I have used this for some time with all smart phones with no problems whatsoever. Now, there's an ad at the top that you cannot get rid of(besides deleting the ad). Ads show up after opening the app, as well as a new ad every time you close an email. EDIT 2/23: Recently the junk mail filter is just about non existing. Email notifications every 3-5min that are ""this message has no content"" junk, all day every day. After a week of flagging junk/phishing as well."
"The mobile version of Outlook gives users easy access to their inboxes. Calendars may be accessed and quickly updated, messages can be drafted and sent in a pinch. Unfortunately for those of us who use RSS feeds, there will be problems. There is currently no way to add a new feed to your inbox nor is there a way to read your current feeds. Edited to note that the application will not push notifications for sub inboxes which can be frustrating."
"Extremely unstable. Typically won't load emails or change mailboxes. Restore the reset button that was removed a few months ago. At least some of the features would work after using the reset button. The Iso version on my other phone works great. As it is now, I need to carry my IP 14 Max Pro just to use Outlook mobile. Less focus on adding features and more focus on reliable functionality would be super cool."
"Edit additional- everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, is now going to inbox!!!! Edit-Update to One star! My contacts are going to junk folder, but still show as contacts!! Some junk mail going to my inbox. Not cool!!!! Easy to use, with one glaring exception. I have to continually mark several emails as not spam. When I then mark them as other, then select the option of all future emails as other; they still go to spam. Extremely annoying and time consuming! There needs to be a fix."
"Awful. The app used to work fine. About 6 months ago it would randomly stop syncing. The only solution was to uninstall & reinstall. This last time didn't work. The app installed but I can't add or access my account. I get a ridiculous error that I'm not online ð. I've even tried accessing via a browser. Same issue. The crazy thing is that Word, Excel, Teams, & One Drive all still work perfectly. I need Outlook for work because I'm away from the office a lot. This is so frustrating ð¤ ."
"Widgets need to have a dark theme. Needs a weekly view in the calendar. The email is a jumbled mess and difficult to see my reply versus what has already been sent. Drains my battery quickly. Often slow to respond and takes a long time to start up. Locks up. It seems bloated and uses a lot of memory like the PC version. I wish Microsoft would write efficient software. If my work didn't use this, I would uninstall it."
"Stay away! Super glitchy. Almost ready to abandon my email address I've had for 20 years just to get away from this. Repeated nonstop notifications for read &deleted emails as well as dimissed notifications. They are just never ending. I have worked with support. Reset the app, reinstalled the app. It stops for a short time and then just starts up again. In message boards across the internet you can see hundreds of people having this same issue. You'd think they would have figured it out by now"
"Awful. Messages don't load until later in the day no matter how many times I open the app. Half the messages that do show up in my inbox say ""this message has no content"". Also, suddenly when I open a message that appears to have loaded correctly it automatically scrolls down to the end of the email. Messages will suddenly disappear from my inbox only to return later (sometimes) and when responding to a group email my message won't send at all because of a problem with just one of the emails."
"Including ads is one thing. But designing the ads to look like unread emails at the top of your inbox is straight-up predatory and misleading. Update 11/22; Junk messages now appear with a sender name but no address, so I can't even verify if the sender is legitimate. Terrible app, switching to virtually anything else I can find, ASAP. Update 1/14; The app now tries to push Microsoft Edge over the user's default browser. Garbage app, use virtually anything else if you can."
"Very, very glitchy. Always freezes refreshing. App crashes whenever trying to open an email by tapping on the notification instead of opening the app and looking for it manually. UPDATE: This app is just getting worse and worse, it will go DAYS without syncing regardless of app restarts, phone restarts, nothing changes. For an email provider who places so much emphasis on being ""for business"", it is completely useless for that market being as unreliable as it is."
"Outlook is the worst app for emails. I've used Hotmail for 20 years, and also have a separate work email. Difficult to navigate. My biggest complaint is I can find old emails with ease on a desktop, yet it's impossible to find important emails just a few days old on the app. Happens constantly. Not in junk, unread, focused, or other. Terrible."
This app is ALWAYS crashing. I need it for my job. Half the time I can't see essential emails because it crashes. It's not just an issue on my new phone. It did it on my iphone 11 xpro. I thought it was glitching so I bought a Google Pixel 7 pro. Still crashes. I have cleared the cache and uninstalled and reinstalled several times. Honestly if I didn't need it for work I would not use it. My coworker has the same issue so it's not just me.
"Unbelievable, in a bad way. No way to ensure that drafts are saved, and it will delete them just by switching to a different app for a quick copy-and-paste. Deletes attachments too, just by scrolling up and down. Can't delete the advertisement. Confusing text entry box at the bottom instead of the top like in an email with several replies. Interminably long refresh time. . Oh, and they just got hacked and gave away my Gmail password. 2023 update (four years later ...) Still crashing...."
"App does not work. At first it just refused to sync emails (in and of itself making the app a brick). Now after over 20 restarts and complete uninstallation of the app it just says that my account doesn't work with outlook anymore, a statement at odds with the fact that I'm currently using the desktop program with the same account. It's not a connectivity issue or the phone not being up to date. The app no longer functions."
This app has gotten worse and worse. I have to manually close out of the app anytime I want to switch between shared inboxes or even when trying to switch between inbox and sent in my OWN email. Sometimes closing and reopening does not work and I have to force stop the app. I've already tried deleting the app and redownloading and that helped....for a day. I'm becoming increasingly frustrated with outlook. The desktop and web version aren't much better either.
"I have had the same email address for the past 30 years. With outlook for past 7yrs. It was okay, a default program without any bells and whistles. But now there is a ton of spam. It seems that there is no actual sender. Blocking sender only seems to cause double the spam. I find myself deleting 10 spam for each valid email. I'm done with outlook. I have deleted the program from my phone."
"I am in literal disbelief about how bad this app this. I am using a new phone, and other email clients have worked well. Any time I attempt to actually do anything on the app it just freezes until I clear the app again and reload it. I don't even know what else to say because I was only planning on using this to send and receive emails; nothing fancy."
"As others have reported, I keep getting a blank white screen, with only the blue outlook banner at the top of the screen and a menu bar at the bottom of the screen that says ""reorder"". Only fix is to reboot the phone. Also, as others have reported, occasionally get the ""no internet connection"" even though I'm home connected to my wifi and all other apps are working and connected to the internet. Finally the latest UI update (Feb '23) which brought the ""new mail"" menu is horrible."
"Terrible. When I try to send an email and am typing, the screen keeps automatically scrolling up to the top. So I'll write a word, then it scrolls up.. then I have to scroll back down, then it scrolls back up.. It's just terrible. A basic feature - sending an email that requires - gasp - scrolling is too much. Done with this. Better options out there."
"UPDATE: On November 29th the app started working like it did before! No shutting down, no glitches. It was like nothing happened. I very happy and watching it. I have no Suddenly my Samsung A13 stopped being able to support Outlook. When opened it will close within seconds. I have tried deleting, restarting my phone and installing and still the same problem. I had to install Microsoft Live on my ho.e page and hope this will also work for my office emails.....ARGH!!! No solution or help anywhere"
Receiving email is fine. Sending email is not possible if your company requires an email signature. Every other instance of this application allows full email signatures with logos. The Android version does not. This is an ongoing issue that I have reported regularly for over 5 years with absolutely no progress from Microsoft. This is an intentional degradation of function on Android devices compared to the iOS/Mac/PC/Web versions that all work properly.
"Tons of junk mail with Microsoft Outlook. Microsoft is known for selling your email to 3rd party garbage lords. Scrolling in emails is broken and very frustrating. There always seems to be some major issue with this app. First out was notifications, then it was emails disappearing, now I haven't been able to scroll within emails for a long time."
"The inclusion of ads alone warrants a one-star rating. Ads have no place in an email app UI from someone as big as Microsoft or Google (who appropriately doesn't include ads in the Gmail app). The ads are extremely obnoxious and intrusive, and are also deceptively integrated into the user interface to boot (appearing in the inbox and designed to look like unread emails). Each app update also seems to remove the most convenient features. Why was the ability to swipe between emails ever removed?"
"Sync nightmare. This weekend, it suddenly dawned on me that I hadn't received any emails in four days! And my Contacts list stopped sync'ing as well, so instead of 200+ contacts, I only had the 11 stored on the phone's local storage. Can't figure out how make everything work again, so I'm switching back to Samsung Email and Calendar."
"The wearOS version of this app is terrible. Emails are plain text only. Some messages are unreadable in plain text. Brining rich text to the app would be a benefit, and I know this because I can access the web app from the galaxy watches browser, and it's a better experience. Finally, the watch app does not function unless the watch is connected to your phone. The app won't work over wifi or LTE on it's own. This is a glaring omission in my opinion."
"The app recently updated and now I no longer get new mail notifications. All settings for notifications are turned on, yet I have to open the app and wait for it to sync to see if there are new messages. This is horrible. I need to know as soon as my work emails come in. Now I have to keep opening and checking it every 5 minutes. Please fix!"
"It should more or less replicate using desktop Outlook. It does not. Perhaps most annoying is fonts and signature choices. There isn't a font choice, and sending a work email from the app, the font displayed on desktop Outlook is bizzare. You also can't insert a logo into signature, or have a different signature for initial and replies. CEO for whom I work really cares about this stuff and discourages people from using the Outlook app."
"The UX violates me. (1) Composing a new message starts with cursor in 'To' field then, while typing, drops to message body. (2) Hitting backspace while swipe-typing inconsistently either deletes a character or a word (Gboard). (3) Send button becomes disabled randomly. (4) Default signature is quite unexpected and annoying. (5) Can I turn off auto-complete? (6) Replying in thread where I wrote most recently sets 'To' to myself; this is inconsistent with the web client which sets 'To' to another."
"-It doesn't have an option to send later on the Android app or on the browser mobile view. I have to go all the way to desktop mode on my browser and use the send later button there. -It doesn't have an error or success message after downloading a file. There's no way to tell if a download was initiated after attempting to download an attachment. -It can't perform a ""Send Now"" on an email that was scheduled to be sent"
"The ""focused"" inbox is almost entirely super obvious spam from accounts I've flagged multiple times. The ""other"" inbox is full of all the ""professional"" emails I have attached to this account. Microsoft is nothing more than a husk of a shell of a joke now. Especially Outlook. I would never recommend Outlook to anyone looking for an email client. I actively tell people not to get one unless they like useless spam in their most important inbox folder."
"I absolutely hate using any Microsoft program. It is so complicated for absolutely no reason. I have an assignment for school where I have to make a flyer and email it to my teachers and every time I would double check and make sure that the document was ok, it would completely ruin the flyer that I made! It took me literally over an hour just to try to keep Microsoft from messing up my formatting. The only reason I use Microsoft products is because of my college."
"Can't delete folders, and when I use the website to do that, this app continues to show the deleted folders, which is very frustrating and makes it difficult to run an efficient mailbox and make use of other great features like Rules. This limitation puts a cap on productivity and makes other mail providers more attractive for anything beyond ""casual emailing""."
"Others seem to be having the same issue as me: the inbox does not update. I get notifications, and can see in notifications the subject, sender, and preview, but only there. Meanwhile, despite resetting the account, my inbox has not shown new emails for several days now. At least the notifications tell me to check my email elsewhere... but that's not the point of the app."
"App was awesome for years then a couple months ago, on my Samsung Flip phone, my business phone, it stopped working. When you touch widget to open, it gets stuck loading only shows a blank screen. If I swipe out of app to close it then reopen, it will open and show contents of whatever the last email box was that was opened. If I which boxes, it freezes and I have go through close and reopen process to get to the desired box. Roll back android updates to 6/15/22. It works fine on iOS."
"I had to take Outlook off of my phone. After working with my provider and making sure all of my phone was configured correctly, it would not work. For some reason, every time I tried to open it, it said the certificate did not match. I asked the IT supervisor if he had it on his mobile, and he indicated yes, and it was working. So, he had me delete everything off my mobile and do a clean install. When I picked my email address on the app, it wanted me to sign in to Microsoft. That should not be."
"Facing issue with Microsoft Outlook, where I am getting notification for read mails as well. Even after clearing the notification, it re-appears at random times. I tried to connect support from within the application as per your FAQ, but the 'Contact support' options is missing under Help. Either update your FAQ or add the option. Further I tried to connect you via your mail under `Contact Developer`, that mail too bounced. Expected better from something offered by Microsoft."
"This is the most important app on my watch, and would be the best app, if there were adjustable settings - especially to turn off All Day Events because they (Outlook ""Up Next"" Complication) consume the entire watch face for the entire day. If there is an all day event, my watch will never tell me the next appointment. Love that my color categories come over from the desktop. PLEASE FIX / REMOVE the ALL DAY EVENTS! Only solution is to manually remove all, all-day events from Desktop :o("
"I'm running Android 10 while using my LG Reflect. Upon repeated installations the issue refuses to correct itself. Please fix your Android Outlook app. It keeps crashing. It won't stay open. No error messages. No screenshots. Fix your app. Outlook running on Android 12 works flawlessly with all 8 email accounts running on it. Microsoft, talk with me, Are you still supporting Outlook on Android 10 with 7 or 8 email accounts?"
"Outlook would be great if it were actually reliable: it takes eternity to update and when I open the calendar for over a minute it still won't update. I use the Teams app for calendar functionality nowadays because that actually loads the few bytes of text I'm looking to see (meetings today), but the calendar widget which basically never refreshes is still an Outlook feature!"
"It randomly locks up and stops receiving emails or updates for no reason at all and the only way to get it to working in is to uninstall and reinstall the whole thing. The app has a reset function, so the developers seem to know this problem is happening but that reset does not work. IMHO the app is just not being QA'd on Android the way it should."
"What a complete pile of garbage. Installed, removed, installed, removed. You can't ever get past adding a new account. Even after adding an account, verifying the account with the app, entering passwords, and completing the robot test you just get to do it all again. You never actually get to seeing any emails. Back to the old POS Gmail app I suppose."
The mobile version is ok.... just ok which means it kinda sucks. It would be great if it had the SAME functionality as the full version. Outlook is a program that even decades later remains heads and shoulders above the rest. So to get this is disappointing. I expect better from Microsoft.
"Emails randomly moved to ""focused"". Whatever that means. It sends non spam emails to the spam folder. It even sends Microsofts own messages about suspicious activity to spam. And because there's no way to change my security info in the app, it's taking that much longer to deal with these repeated suspicious log ins from Russia (the email named where the activity was coming from). So much for user safety. If you don't just have to use this app, please avoid it."
"POS app. I had to install it when Microsoft removed the authentication methods that Google Mail app supports. After using Outlook for a few weeks it started crashing every few seconds. Microsoft recommended solution is to remove the app and reinstall (a real pain when you have multiple accounts you have to reconfigure, and then setup all your settings again). Then a couple weeks after reinstalling it starts crashing repeatedly again."
"This app needs to be reviewed it keeps in doing the samething over and over so I started using my Yahoo instead. The Emails do not download . Also, in order to look for emails I have to enter inbox, deleted, or spam on the search box, and when the emails download, I have to delete one by one, instead of doing several at the same time, nor i can empty the deleted, spam folder, at one time. Also the deleted, spam, and inbox mails, appear all at the same time."
"Since the last update, some emails are failing to load. So I've downgraded from 2 stars to 1. It can't get much worse. Frequently crashes and takes forever to load. Causes the phone to run slowly. Poor layout makes it difficult to use. I've used other email apps that perform so much better. If I wasn't forced to use this app for work, it would have been uninstalled years ago."
"This app is driving me insane. It constantly refuses to enter text I select, especially when the text is formatted as bullet points. Then it suddenly spazzes out and does like 10 random commands in quick succession. Sometimes it ends up replacing text, sometimes it just outright closes whatever I'm working on (I presume because of a crash). I will switch clients if this continues."
Very basic email app. Cannot manage folders which is a pretty essential feature in my opinion. Attachments open in outlook with a massive banner across them saying 'open in 365'; no option to use another app without downloading the attachment and then opening. I use this app for my work emails because I have to but there are many better apps available that are better in every way.
"Too much negative option marketing, too many greyed out buttons, ads in my inbox that have no unsubscribe option and difficult circuitous programming to make any changes. Unless you want to receive marketing. Then it's all very accessible and clearly laid out in bold with highlights, a neon sign and a dog with a top hat holding an arrow sign. This foray back to Outlook lasted 2 days. Samsung email does not do these things. All with more user friendly options to reduce file sizes... etc."
"Incredibly sluggish and unresponsive on my Pixel 6. You'll tap to open an email and the entire app stops responding. Then you'll try to switch to a different folder but the side panel will be blank and not display anything at all. All of this depsite fully clearing all the app's cache and data, and even fully removing and reinstalling the app. Beyond useless when you can't even open an email or switch between folders properly!"
"After the latest update, notification keep popping up for emails that I have seen or read. I don't have the option to turn it off. The options availabale is ""Showing this notification in 15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hour and 2 hours. This need to be fixed. Now it's worst, even after I permanently deleted the email, the notification still popped up. It's been 8 months since the review above and still it's not fixed. 2 days after deleting the email, the notification still pop up on my android phone."
Using this app since it came out and was always 100% satisfied. Unfortunately since like half a year the search function doesnt work at all and notifications randomly reappear. I usually get at least two seperate notifications for the same mail separated by a couple hours. Unfortunately i'll have to uninstall and find an alternative.
"False notifications of new messages The app keeps randomly showing notifications of new messages that I have already read. The messages are old. The time of the messages shown in the notifications is the tin the notification, not of the actual messages. Research has shown that this problem has persisted for a long time. Resetting the app does not resolve the issue. Reinstalling also doesn't. Please fix this soon."
"Laggy, buggy mess. When I launch it one of three things happen. 1. It opens the same email every time and I have to exit out of it (even if I delete it) that seems to randomly change every few days. 2. It opens the wrong page such as calendar or files even if it's a fresh launch. 3. It just loads nothing and stays blank. Even when I can get into the app it takes forever to load and just lags the whole time. I only have about 15 emails in my inbox as well."
"App keeps getting worse. Now, it won't open links in the default browser, and there seems to be no way to change this setting. The app often becomes buggy, in a major way. The latest bug, for example, is that it doesn't open an email, instead displaying âerror.â Help is rarely helpful. Resetting the app doesn't do anything. Even uninstalling and reinstalling the app doesn't always work."
"Awful app. If I didn't have to have it for work I would delete. Personal email account apps work great, this is buggy at best. Incredibly slow to load when opening email. Have to wait before being able to send. Send button is greyed out for a considerable time at completion of email. Often get notification of an email or the first line on the front page then open it but can't see the latest message without searching through the whole chain. Appalling app. So much more to say if I had the space."
I've used this app for a few years with multiple email addresses on multiple phones(android and apple) and they both have issues with using the search function. It often does not allow me to search for emails in any way. I have reinstalled many times and that does not solve anything. I would assume after a few years they would solve this bug but it'll probably never happen.
"App is not functioning. New email notifications come but there is an error and will not open. New emails are not showing up on the app at all - for the last 48 hours. I had to open outlook in a browser to see anything new. Please fix the email feature. I don't need meetings and upgrades, I really just need my email. The refresh outlook email function also does not seem to work. Thank you."
"None of the recent updates have fixed the very annoying notification errors, which have been around for about 4 months. That is, I still get notifications of deleted emails, and the only way to stop this is to actually delete the notification. Now, the app refuses to display all my emails. Microsoft support doesn't answer my questions over 5 days with even an acknowledgment. Tried phoning, but that was even worse. As a paying Microsoft customer, I'm more than disappointed."
"--- since few weeks the app is very slow. Opening outlook take time, opening emails as well. It's impossible to use it. Installing again didn't help. Pity it is not possible to mark events via app. It would be fine to add birthdate for contacts (not possible in non server-exchange). The icons are fine, but I miss a lot - it would be fine to be able to use extra ones."
"Horrible! Unfortunately, I have to use outlook for my work emails. I deal with quite important time sensitive information, and Outlook is so bad at loading up. You get a notification, but the email doesn't open up. You refresh, and nothing works. Happens to all my colleagues. it's quite a common joke about Outlook at work. Would have given 0 stars if that were possible. Alas, I have no other option but to use this app."
Not very happy!!!! Trying to send an email via the outlook app and it keeps saying that I have no more space!! I've deleted EVERYTHING in my one drive and now showing 0.2% of space used yet it still won't allow me to send emails!!! FIX YOUR ISSUES otherwise I will delete and move servers!! Most frustrating thing I've had to deal with over the last 2 weeks and I'm in charge of a team of 200 employees!!! Would rate lower but won't allow me to go below zero
"Disastrous! After the latest update of my phone, the app is frustratingly unusable. Unfortunately, I am forced to use it for business purposes. The app will randomly crash upon opening it. Notifications would come when an email arrives, but when I enter the app, it would take up to a minute to actually show content, and even then there would be no new emails shown until I manually force a refresh. It would not sync with the actual Outlook on my Windows. Garbage."
"Some things don't work very well on this app. Suddenly I'm getting a lot of spam and even receiving notifications for emails that go straight into the junk folder... Why? Edit - still having the same issues, but now it's a lot worse. I have installed a third account (not an office 365 account) and I keep being inundated with notifications for emails I have received days or weeks ago. Incredibly time consuming and frustrating"
"I do not recommend others to use it, I have downloaded this app twice and facing the same issue, I recently sent an email to one of my colleagues which says it is sent successfully, untill I check it in sent files, there is nothing, I have to search all the way to get it by typing his email username, and it was mentioned draft and I do not see it in drafts folder as well, at first I thought it could be my phone that causing this problem but it is still the same after reinstalling it, fix it plz"
"This is a very flawed app. If you want to watch anything at 2x speed, the audio sounds abysmal. Every voice becomes extremely auto-tuned like it's the mid-2000's. Also if you go any higher than 1.65 speed the video either stops playing completely while the audio continues, or it loads one frame every 6 minutes. If you only watch at normal speed, the audio sounds fine but tends to de-sync with the video whenever it feels like, so it's not good for anything, really."
Most media players allow you to select a song in your folder and then you can go to the next song or you can back up to a previous song but not this one. VLC won't let you skip to the next song and instead you get a message that it's the only song in your playlist even though you haven't created a playlist with just one song in it. Counterintuitive and terrible. Also add the entire music folder into a playlist I created called All Music however I can't find it anywhere.
"Very inconvenient. The player lacks one of the most important feature is to remember the last playback and the ability to resume playback where you left off. Instead you always have to navigate, select what to play each and every time. Its especially dangerous on the road. The player has to be able to play from where it left off whenever you press the play button. Or when phone connects to car stereo and automatically starts playback, but this player cant play upon connect. Have to select."
"Very clunky user interface. When playing shuffle mode from a Playlist, if you stop and come back, it starts shuffle over. Sometimes I briefly see a ""continue playing"" song x,y,z but the message disappears too quickly to click. Also sometimes alters the pitch of a song being played slightly, making it sound out of tune (always slows it down). Very annoying. Also often ""stutters"" the beginnings of songs."
"This software has become garbage. I can't get it to do the simplist of things. Playing through a directory of audio files doesn't work. It shuts off during songs. Won't go to the next song. The interface is horrible. No way to jump ahead in a song. Standard buttons like fast forward, reverse or a scroll bar aren't present."
"I have a pixel 6 and the app put something in the notification bar. When I tried to swipe down, the phone would get caught in a refresh loop and eventually crash. At one point it said the os does were corrupted but luckily when I tried again it booted. I began removing new apps one by one and recreating the situation. Once I removed VLC, it stopped crashing. I did try to connect to a networked drive but it didn't work, but unsure if that might've had something to do with it."
"I used to love this app (used it for years on phone and computer) but after upgrading my phone, I learned that certain folders are banned from reading media according to them. I used the default folders and it still won't read my video files. I have to dig each one out individually from downloads each time I want to watch and there's no way to tell which folder is banned. Not worth the effort, I'm sure there's better apps at this point."
"While the desktop version is perfect, the mobile app is one of the most uncomfortable music apps out there. Very easy to accidentally erase tracks from playlist just by touching them. Good chance that it will even circumcise some of your tracks to 30 seconds in length, why? Every time I start it, it refreshes all the tracks and videos, taking looong time, while I just want to play one small file already in playlist. Lost lots of files because of this app, not happy!"
"I was forced to upgrade my phone (samsung s20 using android v.12), and this app won't even stay active long enough for me to figure why it won't work - it crashes instantly and consistently. I downloaded VLC (v.3.5.3) a week ago because I used previous versions on all my older phones with no issues, but this one won't work at all. It's never worked. UPDATE - I waited for an update, and receiving none, I tried un-installing it, then reinstalling it. It seems to work fine now."
"Absolutely no where near what the computer program is. The app is incapable of separating video and audio files for playback reqiring deletion of video files to use as an audio player only. No ability to mark files to not play, it is play or delete the file, nothing like remove from library. Additionally it randomly stops requiring starting the app again. When the screen lock is on if you unlock the phone the music resets to the last song playing when the phone was locked. The app sucks."
"No longer plays after screen lock. Yes, I've changed the setting for video, but there's not one for audio. This makes the app completely useless as a media player, which is its main purpose for me. Uninstalled. Which is sad because I've used VLC on multiple devices for over a decade. I cannot send debug logs as I have uninstalled it. Galaxy Fold 3 with Android 13."
"Just sick of this app that used to work well and then needed to be ""improved"". Remains a 1 star. How this app can't restart an audio book after being paused for 2 hours, but then will restart it all evening, like 12 hours later when I don't care anymore. Just infuriating. Make more ""improvements"" while this app still can't play music without start/ stop/ pausing/playing everytime! It's been years and multiple devices and it can't even start and properly play music files!"
"App works great except for the fact I cannot get it to stop scanning my device for media. Turned off the option but I constantly get the notification it's scanning again. Let me know when you fix this bug as I won't let any app on my device that scans automatically. Lost a customer, been using VLC for years but no more. The idea that you have the right to scan my device without asking, at least other apps ask toinvade your privacy, but not this one."
"After scanning all my files and telling me they're there, it can't play any of them. When I finally find a round about method of getting them to play, there is no ""currently playing"" playlist. UI is cumbersome to the point of unusable. Vlc normally has a good showing, not here."
"You guys f it up. Now folder play for music doesn't work, it tries to play pdf jpg zip and get stuck on all files. Never the music in your download folder. It was so nice before, i never update so i don't know when the issue started. But it's worthless now. Looking for an alternative, i don't remember the version no. That last works"
"Used it for years and then suddenly stopped working. This is why I HATE updating apps! It'd been acting weird for the past few days, in ways it usually never does, so I decided to update it. Well, now it won't open at all. It's the only player I use on my PC, and I've been a VLC user for so many years that I cannot even remember when I started, so this is extremely disappointing. I don't know what's happened. Even the native music app on my phone sucks because it inexplicably has ads."
Music now stutters at regular intervals on both this app and on my PC. So i had thought it was my bluetooth headphones. i tried my PC with a different pair. Same result. Its VLC. Windows Media Player doesnt have this issue nor does spotifies local player. VLC is busted its not fun listening to music for it to pause for a second to buffer every 3 to 5 seconds in a song.... for all my music
"The Linux and MSWin versions of this are fabulous. Not so the Android version. It can't remember from one time to the next what music/videos are in storage. If you try to add directories to the playlist, the app hangs. If it's supposed to index files, it HANGS. If you go into the settings to tell it which directories to index, it won't let you select any of them. If you ever see a ""Loading"" message, that is the equivalent of ""Hung and Dead"". Reduced to ONE star until it's fixed."
"How do you take an app that was one of the best around and turn it an utterly worthless piece of junk? This was my only music app for, literally, years. After the update, it consistently cannot find my music or playlists. One day I see all my music, one day there's no music, another day I may see some of my music. I kept hoping there would be a fix, but I'm not seeing it. Time to walk away from the train wreck. Uninstalling."
"I love the app on the Windows platform. But despite the hype, this is NOT a complete port to the Android platform. It lacks many of the most basic functionality that can be found in the worst media players out there. Case in point, VLC cannot remember what you played last or where you were at. Imagine trying to listen to a 15 Hr. audiobook when you have to manually find your place every time you pause or close the app. (App crashes constantly on Android 11.) This is not only very frustrating, it renders the app useless. VLC should have tested the app before porting it."
"You can't rewind an audio file to the beginning, because the stupid app extends the play bar to the very edge of the screen. My phone touch screen can't reach the very edge, and so I can only rewind my audio file to 4 seconds into it, instead of at the beginning. Very infuriating. Lots of bugs with this app. It needs a lot of work, and some common sense. Find a different app in the meantime. I usually use Music Speed Changer, which lets you easily make clips from the audio file."
"the user interface is seemingly intentionally designed to be as annoying as possible and potentially to cause epileptic seisures. if you don't move the mouse for 3 seconds, it automatically forces you into full screen. there was a basic explanation of how to do everthing in the beginning, and it is all so inconveniently designed. just put buttons for everything at the bottom of the screen and give the OPTION for full screen. the key is to give the customer freedom so they can actually enjoy it."
Although the app is a well-made app overall. It has glaring flaws that make it unusable. At random points it will develop a flaw which makes it start the music file or video file in the middle of the song or video. The only way to fix this is to completely clear the memory of the application. The frequency that this happens is increasing.
"I have used VLC for more than ten years -- on Macs, PCs, Linux, and Android. Beginning with this version, I can no longer manually load subtitles, which makes the app unusable on my Android devices. I am currently working on removing it from my tablet and manually installing an older version. Sorry, but this has gone from being the best media player on the planet, to becoming a major fail."
"Issue with app. Love VLC, however, listening to audio files (books), it will randomly pause and I'll have to go into the app and hit play again. It will also clear what's being played if it was paused for more than 2 min if not the app on the screen. The odd thing about this issue is that it will clear what you were listening too and you have to go to folder to reopen it, and find your place, however, if using headphones and hit the play button. It will play were it left off and reopen the file"
"The player itself is great! I like the interface, and I use VLC on all my devices. However, the Android version keeps ""parsing media"" and removing songs or entire albums from my library. Since this happens across multiple android devices, I can safely conclude that it is not a hardware error. Often times I'm forced to uninstall and reinstall so VLC can read my whole media library again. This has become a weekly process, and therefore I give this app one star. Would give zero if I could."
"Used to work great; now it's unusable. :-( VLC is the most amazing media app for PCs. It also got really good on Android. But a recent update now causes it run super slow. It takes 20 mins to load my media, even though I turned off auto rescan. It won't even recognize my SD card during this wait. I used to open the app, and folders I'd favorited would be ready to click and play. Now, I have to navigate between tabs for video, audio, browse, and playlists to find what I need. Please fix VLC!"
"Playlist Organization Changes are Bizzare! I would like to revert back to previous version but can't. Which means the auto update system forces the user to use each and every new update. So specifically, when you search for a video to add it to a playlist, you have to scroll down each time just to enter the addition. The playlist now forces users to view their playlist in thumbnail mode. This takes up a lot of space forcing the user to see thumbnail images for each playlist name. More."
"Worked great for a while, then I didn't use it for a week or two, tried using it again to play my videos and when I paused it, 20 minutes later came back in to see it STILL PLAYING, but it wasn't the video, it went to playing only audio. Not cool! Now I can't get it to work at all. Time to find yet another video player. Maybe one with continuous play mode and not have to click to the nexxt one again and again each time it's opened."
"Cumbersome and Frustrating. Unable to play music from controls of a connected Bluetooth device. Unable to resume music from pause if pause lasts longer than 30 seconds. Shuffle all button no longer functions despite no app updates since it last worked. Not even in the same galaxy of utility and polish as the Windows app. I need this to do one thing: play music, over Bluetooth, in my car. For that, it is unfit for purpose."
"Doesn't remember where you left off in playlist or even where video or audio was paused, go to start it back up and it starts from beginning of track. If listening to a video and you lock screen, video stops. It will not continue to play in background. When you go to restart video, it starts from beginning rather than where you left off. It's a shame, makes it hard to use, very unacceptable."
"A disaster after the last couple of updates. When I choose a movie from my media list the wrong movie starts playing. Thumbnails are all mixed up. The wrong thumbnails are on the wrong movies. I lose sound in a movie and nothing will get it back. Oh, wait! I can get sound back when the picture goes black for absolutely mo reason. I tried reinstalling it. It didn't help. They want access to my media files when I reported the problem. VLC's days are over and they don't care. Neither should you."
"This app has some major issues. 1. There is a significant audio delay when one uses an audio Bluetooth device. This is the most important issue 2. I can't delete videos in the app 3. I can't rename videos in the app Other video players I have used have none of these issues, which means they can be fixed. Edit: Oh how rich of you! Renaming files is ""intrusive"", job of the file explorer, but you're perfectly comfortable with deleting said files. The Bluetooth audio issue is most important btw."
"Long time user, very unhappy. The app crashes continuously after updates, especially the last one. Every time the app updates I lose years of playlist work, which just happened, with no way to retrieve my playlists. I'm now looking for a better audio app. I've used this app for probably 5 or 6 years now but I can't anymore. It just constantly crashes and freezes and deletes my playlists, which I put hours and hours into. I wish these updates would have never happened, they ruined the app for me."
"I updated to the newest version and does not perform as good as the previous one. Keeps on dropping out the playlist when you switch between car, speaker or headphones and, you must start the Playlist from the beginning. Please, fix it or let us know how we can switch back to previous version. Thks."
"The same serious issue remains. While using the fast forward/reverse bar inevitably the playback will freeze. At times the playing resumes on its own after a delay of several seconds. Other times it remains paused even after waiting more than a minute. I experience this with my two newer model Samsung devices REPEATEDLY. I don't have this problem playing the same mp4 files with other players. You've had years to fix this bug, and despite numerous updates--NOTHING!!!"
"Android widget broken with latest update. I've used this app for years, but the widget now gets stupid after pausing. When trying to restart a music playlist, it flashes ""multiple media cannot be played"" repeatedly as it looks to restart and find something to play. You guys seriously have me considering another player soon if this keeps up. Thanks for years of open source heaven. Hope you straighten things out."
"Update: Installed older version 3.1.0-RC4 and soooo much better! Original post: Every version is more unstable than the last. Audiobooks that I listen to all the time now skip around at random or VLC simply crashes. Feels like VLC is possessed by evil spirits. I keep updating, hoping that these things get fixed, but they only get worse. Uninstall/reinstall does NOT help. Deleting playlists doesn't help. And the User Interface gets more confusing & frustrating each update!"
"Recent update stops continuous play. I have to open my phone for it to start the next song. Have always had an issue with it cycling through the same 20 or so songs when on random with access to entire library list pulled up. Looking at the other reviews the October 2021 update messed up a ton of things. Might want to get on that, I'll update my review if things are corrected."
"designed for video, not music; playback rate is slightly unstable and I can hear it warping the pitch of my music. It's pretty subtle but I'm not the only one who's noticed in these reviews. It's open source so I could fix it in theory but it seems like a pretty weird bug and I have no idea why it's happening. I'd recommend just using foobar or something."
"This piece of trash always scans for directories despite me turning the feature off and crashes about 2 minites into the scan, if I try and go into the options to disable scanning bia individual directories it says I can't because it's scanning. So it's in a constant loop of scanning and crashing and there's nothing I can do to stop it, it's horrible software and hasn't been fixed in a long time. Not giving this another chance ever again."
"Recent update prevents closing VLC after playing media: can't close it from the app window, can't close it from the notification bar. Weak. Watch out if you have a time limit on your porn consumption. Also: Adding multiple songs to playlists is a crapshoot. You may or may not have to add each song one-by-one. Even if you do, VLC will frequently start up with empty playlists or with incomplete playlists (missing items). Pretty lame, dude."
"The newer updates have made using the fast forward/rewind, volume control, pause/play, etc into a nightmare of triggering issues. I'll try and swipe the volume up and oh look I've fast forwarded. If I try to go further away from the fast forward trigger area for volume up I pause it. You have the rewind/fast forward as a single click trigger instead of the original double. Makes controlling the player a nightmare now."
"Doesn't work with the latest versions of android & firefox. It no longer comes up as an option for opening video...even when it is installed. Have found no solutions to the problem. Problem presented itself right after a major update to the phones OS and after updating apps...including VLC. Can't determine where the problem is (with OS, with Firefox/Mozilla, or with VLC)....or how to fix it."
I'd give it zero stars if I didn't have access to my songs even though I have to go all the way through the directories then go to my external SD card then click the music link to play anything. FIX IT!!!! I Put the whole library on the front page of the app at least 3 times probably more I've lost count & I had to calm down before writing this because if I didn't it would be filled with f-bombs and other curses. I loved the VLC player a lot WHEN it works
"Can't stream from my computer to my Samsung Tablet. Always SMB Authorization pop up. Sometimes clicking ""OK"" or ""CANCEL"" will help, but not all the time. After two weeks of troubleshooting...it worked. For one day. Then it started again. Do not use if you're streaming from PC to any Android device. Very disappointed. Honestly, maybe it's time the devs start taking some money and hiring some full time developers and releasing more fixes and updates, too many ""meh"" responses from devs."
Unnecessarily scans and parses media just to browse and play files and takes forever to do it. Can't browse files until it's complete. Well over 20 minutes of scanning and parsing is ridiculous. What is it even doing? It should not take that long to generate thumbnails. It would be better if it just did it when the folder was opened and I should be able to browse and open files before it finishes whatever unnecessary task its running.
"This app needs to work out the bugs quickly! It used to be able to start back up right away whenever I would get a phone call. If another app happens to make a sound, it makes this stop streaming altogether. I have to reset the connection after every sound whichever app may make while I stream radio. It used to never stop a live stream even with the pause button, but that was at least useful when you take off the headset. The option to not detect removal of headset doesn't work"
"Since the November 2019 update, it won't scan almost 200 folders worth of music in my SD card, despite deleting and reinstalling app (during which it froze after downloading). It was my go-to for listening to my own music (hell no, neither Google nor Apple is getting subscription money for tracks I haven't released yet!). Going back to the factory app (LG). I rode with VLC since before HTML5, but no more. 2020 edit: new phone; stuttering, speed fluctuations playing music. Disappointed again."
I have used vlc for years without any issue. It's the go to for viewing videos. I used to use it for audio playback as well. But that now sucks because EVERY SINGLE AUDIO TRACK FOR EVERY ALBUM IS DUPLICATED. This is on both my android phone and tablet. Uninstalled and reinstalled but it still keeps duplicating all audio entries even though I verified only one of each file exists
"I simply cannot understand why VLC is still unable to fix their ongoing problem with the audio. I play a video or music file and the audio suddenly drifts up a pitch or two, then suddenly drifts down a pitch. This happens a lot when playing audio files. PLEASE FIX THIS! I'm going back to MX Player."
"Can not play movies in their original aspect ratio, always stretching pictures vertically and want to use exactly as my phone's screen size. For example original movie has black bar on top and down but this app always want to eliminate it and use full screen that results is awkward. I tried all setting but there is not advance setting in new versions. I tried other apps like MX player to make sure this is not my phone's fault , but other apps play well in original aspect ratio."
I use it to play voicemail files because it's the only app I know of that can play the files. One thing I absolutely HATE about it is that it takes over my Bluetooth media and it's like pulling teeth to get it to give control to my Google Play Music again. Had to uninstall it. Now it's taking over default media player and won't let other apps play music.
"Seems to have an issue with dropping/resuming streams. Other apps I've used for IP streams don't have an issue maintaining connection and then retrying IF it does drop. I am sitting on top of my router and testing this, and every station drops after a minute or two, then eventually will not start again.  This is not a device/connection issue. Other apps work fine. I gave VLC a shot because they are a trusted name. The playlist editing features are also weak, can't even reorder things.  I'd expect much better from VLC. For streaming stick with Xiaalive, and for on-device or cloud use google music. Done."
"The playlists are useless after the first time I play them. The next time I open that playlist and select a track to start playing, it skips through that track instantly and often skips through several more after. It will then refuse to play any of the tracks it skipped through or has previously played. Extremely frustrating. I'll need to find another app."
"Wouldn't stop glitching. I set it to lock in landscape, but every time id tap the screen to bring up playback controls, it would just switch to portrait mode instead of bringing up controls. If it weren't for this, I might've ditched Kodi for VLC but that really ruined the experience for me to not even be able to watch or control video playback correctly."
"VLC version 3.1.7, I've emailed developer with no response, using Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and this keeps crashing after about 10 minutes of music play time, new version interface sucks, not as convenient to go through music and it keeps rubberbanding back to the beginning. I love the PC version, hopefully developer team will listen to reviewers and make some changes or email back their consumers. Cheers!"
"When I pause a video in Vlc, switch tabs and then go back to vlc almost all the time the app freezes, the audio is never in sync with a video file, I have to adjust the audio sync even though no other video app does this. if the issues i wrote down were fixed this app would be perfect. I enjoy using VLC on windows, it's a shame the android version isnt good. I'm on galaxy s10 plus."
"I deleted the app. First it changed my ring tone settings which are ALL personalized that way I know when to ignore spam calls. And the spam ring tone song was deleted from my phone. Took me 20 minutes to get it back, thank goodness. The nightmare, half my gallery disappeared. Read the permissions. ""It needs ""modify or delete the contents of your USB storage"", in order to allow deletion of files and store subtitles."" Permanently from phone not just the app! Consider adding a trash box!"
"File list not working, keeps crashing every time I try to watch a video, and prevents my tablet from connecting to the internet. Just verified, finally, it is 100% VLC blocking my wi-fi. Don't know what screwed up with the last update, but it turned to total trash and is unusable as long as my internet won't work while it is not force-stopped and wiped out of the cache."
"I'm not sure when it started. Update after update hasn't resolved it. When I watch a video on VLC with headphones (not earphones, those are seamless always) whether it's wired or bluetooth, the audio is weird then cut off/silent for a few seconds every time I press play, at any timestamp. If I start a video from the beginning, I don't get to hear the first few seconds no matter what I do. To note: I tested the same video files on another player, and it didn't produce the same problems."
"It would be great if it worked properly. When playing a live stream it doesn't retry on a network change, so if the Wi-Fi reconnects or mobile data changes between EG 1xRTT, EvDO, and LTE it just stops playing entirely. This is really annoying. Streaming is literally the only thing I use it for because compared to the Windows version this is useless. I'm on an LG V20 which has the high end DAC that supports many sample rates and I'm pretty sure this VLC just uses the Android 48kHz default."
"I've used this app for years and until now I've never had a problem. I'm not sure when it started, but every time I loaded up a video, the VLC icon would spin the entire time like it was trying to load. Even though the video was already playing flawlessly. Annoyed, I tried reinstalling it and now it won't even open. Truly unfortunate. It's the best media viewing app on the store.. or at least it was when it worked."
"Last update ruined it, playlist ui is larger causing you have to scroll more, and songs in playlist are being completely unplayable due to some sort of bug that jumps to the end of the song, sometimes chaining or getting worse where 3 songs will be 'played' and it even persists after closing the app. A step backwards. Hope the bug is fixed. I play music from my micro sd card for storage space."
"Why? Why the new update?!!? It's so limiting now!! Instead of rewinding to the begining of the song and exiting out easily, i have to go back in the app and find out how I'm supposed to turn off the music!!! And the layout for the music tracks and stuff is AWFUL!!!! I can't find the equalizer anymore and playing audio while phone is turned off is a pain in the ass now!! Plz fix this since its unbearable to deal with. The update was admittingly a HUGE letdown."
"Andoid ver. used to be really good, but now it has annoying glitches. I can no longer choose between ext. & Int. SD, All Folders & Playlists it displays as ""Unknown"" (though it scanned all storage for music!) The ONLY way to find songs is alphabetically. The controls DISAPPEAR when playing a song. I can no longer choose: Folder/Playlist, Repeat song, Repeat all (in folder/playlist), pause, stop, play. And to Stop, I MUST REBOOT PHONE!!! Please fix!!! (Android 8 Oreo, Galaxy S8 a)"
Been having a similar issue to some other people. Up to the most recent update when you play a song it will play for about 30-60 seconds and then suddenly stop. And app reverts to main screen like you were no playing anything at all. I noticed in my Android phone's notification tray that at this point (when it stops playing) that the app is doing some level of indexing but I can understand for what. Android 11.x on a LG V60. Already deleted cache and set all permissions that seemed logical.
"I wanted to like this app. I use it on my laptop all the time and it's great. The mobile app, not so much. It doesn't play all my files. The ones that won't play on another app play on vlc but vlc won't play other files. My old Sony experia music app played them all with no problem. Loading takes forever as well. And it won't just play all your files, you need to create a Playlist. Overall not worth it, it's getting deleted."
"years of using vlc on every platform.Now won't replay a played file if finished, even with shutdown. Can workaround by using through file program, but can't playlist that way. This most recent downloaded version has to be the worst disappointment of lack of functionality I've seen. Playlist is a pain and miss the record option in mobile version. Can play wide range of file types, sound boost & multiple speed playing doesn't warp audio into higher registers- the only reason I'm still using. Fix!"
"I've been using VLC for PC for many years and hoped this app would work similarly but found insurmountable problems with it. When trying to listen to or download recorded radio shows, it hijacks the stream without giving me the option to save it. Keeps playing in background even after closing the source web page and the app causing me to have to shut off the phone or uninstall the app to stop it. When trying to switch to the app to access the file, the app does not load to foreground when tapped"
"I picked up this app ad an audiobook player. Went in, found my place in the book to prepare for later. When i opened it later and pressed play, it began the book from the beginning. Rushed and found my place again, not happy. I set a 15 minute timer. After the timer went off, guess what. Playback unavailable. Pressing play starts the book over again. Now, Im finding my olace again and looking for a new app to listen to it in. ""Editor's Choice"" was way off with this one."
GREAT VIDEO PLAYER FOR ANY FORMAT!!! but why the one star??? because I just found out that it is the only app that has been going through my snapchat files + old pictures off my SD memory card... ES File explorer tracks activity of files being created. VLC has created it's own folder with thumbnails of what it has been viewing. i'm talking about pictures from 2+ years ago which I havent bothered to open in the last week yet they manage to view them as well as saved snapchats recent and long ago.
"Please for the love of God fix the scrubber bar so that you can COMFORTABLY access the WHOLE THING on mobile. The dot to drag it around is tiny and oftentimes you can't even drag it to the very beginng or end of the track because the dot goes to the edge of the screen. Increase size of the dot, and make the scrubber bar shorter. Also add skip forward/back keys in player, having to hold the skip track buttons is an unnecessary step."
"VLC for desktop computers is great, this bizarrely barely works in comparison. If I pause something for a bit, it can't resume playing and it just forgets the podcast I had loaded up entirely. Have to reload the file and find where I last was. It can't display file names right. Just multiple frustrating basic failures with it. I will uninstall."
UPDATE: Downgrade from 5 stars. It crashes so frequently whenever I use the casting function (chromecast or firestick) it is rare to get ten minute uninterrupted play. Happening for months now. Casting from other apps works fine but I miss VLC. Please release bugfix!!! old review: Perfect for most users. its wealth of features configurability and lack of ads low resource use and it plays in the bg? how much better could it get?
"The new UI is terrible, very hard to navigate compared to the previous version. Why do frontend developers insist on reinventing everything when users are already accustomed to a solid working interface? Scrolling through different sources involves both vertical and horizontal scrolling, and the text is constrained inside tiny icons. What happened to a good old list where I can see all the text. Also ran into crashes in the first minute of using it, trying to edit a UPNP favorite. Please revert."
"I've only used it for audio, but the program shuts down as soon as it is paused for too long, or when another app is opened. And the file (if opened via an external program) is not stored in the VLC play history, yet if I reopen it externally in VLC, half the time it starts from where it cut off. only positives are that it's nice to be able to jump to a certain time stamp, set up a sleep timer, and adjust the playback speed, but the rest is bad enough that I will be uninstalling this app."
Unreliable. Audio does not work while Chromecasting half the time and randomly stops playing the file throughout. I have reinstalled this app several times hoping it has been updated but problem has been persistent for over 6 months. It also seems to leave something saved in your hardware without your permission as somehow the files resume where they've left off even after uninstalling and reinstalling.
"SUDDENLY, after years of success with this app, it RANDOMLY sometimes starts a song file by starting 2 seconds into the song but only playing a tenth of a second of it, then blank space, then picking back up, 2 more seconds into the song. Whatever you idiots did to this app, WHICH WAS WORKING JUST FINE BEFORE YOUR RECENT UPDATES, THANKS. I am now your biggest and most vocal critic. I even factory reset my device and downloaded a fresh version on VLC player, and, yup, same malfunction. Idiots."
"Don't get me wrong; vlc is my favorite media player. However one programmer's shallow, unimaginative, lazy thinking can (and very often does) ruin a formerly excellent piece of software. This version's utter obliviousness to the user's need for the software to _hold the user's place_ (in an 11-hour file or 40-item playlist, e.g.) for more than a few minutes' pause, is enough for me to abandon this technically far superior phone for one whose vlc version does not 'feature' such forgetfulness."
"This is the default free video player for both Windows and Android. It works okay but also has major issues. It rescans my media library randomly throughout the day when I'm not using the app and even after I force close the app. Very suspicious privacy invasive battery draining and just ridiculous behavior. Tons, and I mean tons, of bugs and issues. In theory this is an amazing app. In practice it's extremely frustrating to use. They need to stop feature creep for a year and do some upkeep."
"Make sure you back up your SD card. This app corrupted mine and I lost all my pictures and videos. It's buggy with several features that just don't work such as designating only certain folders to be scanned and creating playlists. The only good part about this app is that it does, infact, play videos."
One star because music just starts playing when you connect to bluetooth and no option to stop it. But an option to resume or not after a call.... really dumb design whoever made this should NEVER even made a resume on connect. In the first place. Mosy of the time its on the middle of song that wasnt even playing. Thank you and i assume this will never be fixed.
"Love vlc desktop, hate this app. It has the SAME issues like other ones. Go to use the shuffle feature and it doesn't shuffle. Won't shuffle when I press the forward button on my car or from the widget. It works half the time. But Samsung default app works fine and other devices don't have an issue. Problem is the default Samsung app sucks for using it as a folder player and blacklisting certain folders."
"Glitches at nearly everything I do. The glitch is the app goes all black screen with no interactable button or function just have to restart the app and doing it all again. It happened whenever I added a track to a playlist, deleted a track from a Playlist, creating a Playlist, browsing my track list which yeah I have a lot... +1000 some of which apply to various activities I do."
"WTH have you people done? I need the prior version. Lan browsing didn't work, but at least everything else worked well. It takes 20-30 seconds to open any folder, and kicks you out of the file browser after you select a file. You just turned one of the best media apps into one of the worst."
"Music is only playable in 2 cases: if I browsed my memory and directly clicked to play a file, or if I browsed the storage from within the app. Music can't show up in the audio directory. I once saved a playlist, but its music is unplayable. I already have my music folder from my media library settings enabled, but the phone shows me that the app scans for a while, and no music to be found. My phone is new and very fast with 8GB of RAM. Surely the app is faulty."
"Used to love this program on PC then on iOS and Android. However nowadays... only the shadow of what it used to be. 1st the subtitles SRT files won't work. When trying to, the video freezes and becomes black. 2nd When I search a video in the search box, click Enter, the thumbnails of the videos I want to watch appear, but then I click on them they play a totally different video. Just imagine I wanna show a video of a hot air balloon to someone and instead it plays an adult rated film. ?!!?"
"1) While listening to music the start time in timer is showing negative value. 2) When using play as audio as video file, it still plays in video mode. Please fix these 2 issues. They are so annoying. Edit 2: Every new update new bugs keep coming and devs are not even bothering to fix old bugs. Vlc used to be such a great app, they really made it so trash now"
"You know this app could be better if it could STOP removing my self songs that i have in each playlist. It makes no sense for the app to randomly remove the songs in my playlist without my permission and making me waste my time adding them back to the playlist. It's not like the Windowa media player, it doesn't remove songs from the playlist without my permission unless I do so"
"After years of flawless use of this app, it now does not see, and will not play my music that's on the sd card (the phones built in player plays the music, so it's not a sd card issue). I've never had a problem before, as that's where my music is stored. I will have to find another player."
Using this player with other devices seems working fine but when I used Honor X9a phone to cast from my phone to our android TV it seems like it's not working properly. The video will cast but after a few minutes the video will restart again from the beginning which is always happening when I used my new device. It's weird since its working fine on my Xiaomi device.
Used this for many years. After this recent update the sound doesn't match the video. It like one of those Chinese movies with the English sound track added. You have mess with it to get it to work right. I'm done.
"This new version crushes all the time and freezes when u're playing a 1080pes video resolution. It takes too long to play/load a playlist and sometimes it's always bugging and it doesn't support subtitles, like, it completely cracks! Why it don't support 720 and upper quality?"
"Wow really cool that the app scans folders automatically except when it constantly scans folders except the external storage ones making them disappear completely, then I have to manually scan everything again just so I can see the external storage media appear again, it even happens mid song, extremely annoying and constant"
The app was okay at first then it started behaving strangely. I opened it and couldn't find any of my videos and music I tried to refresh but it wasn't responding now I can't access any of my videos and music. Really heartbreaking.
I finally had to end up uninstalling it in order for it to stop playing after disconnecting it from Bluetooth because it wouldn't close and kept playing music. There's a lot of bugs in this that apparently have not been addressed.
It was a great video player app. But after recent update there is a glitch .I cannot rotate video . It plays in portrait only. Please fix this issue as soon as possible.
"On fresh install startup of app, The app crashes every time on startup while showing scanning media on notification bar, to be honest I always deselect let vlc scan media on startup but it still scans it please fix, I can't open any movies at all because of this. The app crashes."
"VLC keeps including every file on my phone in its media library, even when I've set it to only one folder. It keeps automatically scanning my ENTIRE DEVICE, even when I turn off automatic scanning. Casting has a 90% chance to crash the app. I just want to watch my anime, man."
"As far as I can tell, there is no point in getting this app. Half the time it can't hear your piano, it's constantly advertising the guitar version, and worst of all, you literally cannot get past the first course without paying an OBSCENE subscription fee. Once you know the first 5 notes, clearly you're ready and willing to give them money ig ð don't get it, just look up some damn youtube tutorials."
"The reason for the one star is primarily because the SPEED at which songs play in the lessons and songs section seems to have increase 4-5x from before. No newby is going to be learning at 5x speed. This makes advancing through lessons impossible. Even a 60% speed seems to be 1.5x of before. This is on top of the numerous MIDI issues and sound recognizing issues. Starting lessons are good, but that's about it."
Billing nightmare! Every year I go through the same thing with this app. I have never been able to cancel my subscription through Google pay it doesn't even give me the option. Yet every year they charge me and I have to end up disputing the charges through my bank. My card gets locked and I have to wait for a new card which then screws up all my bills that are on auto pay. It's a joke. This app is a joke and the developers are a joke. I do not recommend.
"This is a decent app for true beginners; ie, children who have never had any experience with playing a musical instrument before. The free trial does not offer much to anyone who has progressed further than having proper posture. Note recognition, even after I read the provided info to help with the issue, is awful and only works if your device volume is off and your keyboard turned up all the way. I was billed $90 after free trial instead of monthly. I have emailed them, hope for a refund. -Ren"
I'm just starting out leaning piano and I thought the app was very helpful. I wish I could continue using it but sadly I don't have the money for the premium subscription to go beyond the basics Edit: after getting the free trial I decided I wanted to cancel after not being able to finish a lesson because it wasn't registering the notes. I tried to cancel several times and got an error message. I emailed the company and got an automated response and they charged for the full year subscription.
"Worst teaching app I have ever used. Only has a practice mode is if you screw up on certain parts and then it entirely ignores your other mistakes. The progression moves way, way to fast. The courses need to be stretched out longer. After the first lesson, and of course after paying for the damn app, things move much faster with no way to slow the tempo. The five minute workouts are a joke and are not designed very well. Overall, I would recommend avoiding this one. Needs a lot more work."
"Very confusing and frustrating. When I try to sign back in, it won't let me. It automatically goes into ""practice mode"" when I don't have to and when I play the right key, it indicates I played the wrong one even though I place the phone right by the speaker. Goes very fast and I cant learn at my own pace. Practice is very frustrating as a person who is a perfectionist. My friends have had the same frustrating experience. Trash app."
"Fantastic app for all levels of piano learning. Combines awesome visual, audio and repetition for amazing progress. However, it doesn't work and when you ask for help support just says your piano is out of tune our app works fine. Problem is I plugged my keyboard into the app via USB and it makes the same mistake. I asked for a refund now they won't talk ð£ to me ð¡ at all."
"So, I understand that you cant always make everything free and that an app is a very expensive thing to maintain, but I would like if you didnt have false advertisement. I wanted to learn how to play piano and was quite intrigued by this ad, especially the free part. Then, after about 6 lessons I was told I need to pay. I wouldn't have minded paying, but I just deleted the app since you are scamming people for free downloads. You should change it from free to free trail, it's just annoying."
"The app is well thought out but the premium thing just sucks. $89.99 a year? Come on. It says in app purchases but the whole app needs to be purchased if you even want to learn the essentials. I've played piano at a very young age and I know that sheet music is still better than scrolling music. Sometimes you can't even keep up with the song and overall, it's not a good app for beginners. I would recommend Yousician because it has lessons updated every day, and you don't have to pay for it."
"It was good for the first 30 seconds but after that it got annoying. Especially when it puts you in practice mode. It has a constant beat that goes on and will drive you insane. If you try to exit practice mode, you can. but if you try to get back on. It restarts your lessons. (wich sucks when your one lesson away from the next one). You dont get to choose a song you want to play until after the basics. and to the people who download this, dont. Just search your songs on YouTube. It works better"
"When I first downloaded the app, I completed the free lesson and decided that I wanted to purchase a yearly subscription. When the app prompted that I subscribe, (in order to begin the second lesson) the app said that the yearly subscription price was $6.00. Don't get me wrong the app is great for learning to play the piano, but when I looked at the charges on my debit card, I found out that i had been charged $71.99!"
"This app is a sucks!!! It makes you pay to do anything beyond beginner, its microphone is useless, and it just doesn't fit my level!! When I turn it on it always tells me to turn on my microphone, although it's already on. It then constantly gives me reminders on how to play the notes, yet never picks them up! I think that in order to truly use this app you have to either plug it in to an electric keyboard or put inside a grand piano!! I hate it and its worthless!! I wish I could give 0 stars!!"
"This game sucks. The timing is very slow. I've been playing piano for 2 years and I wanted to skip over the first three notes quickly. When the first song came, no matter how high my volume was, the notes were counted as wrong. I was brought into practice mode multiple times and when it actually heard the notes and let me play the song, it would not register the notes AGAIN. This was my 2nd time downloading it, still a disappointment. Do. Not. Install."
"A great idea that fails at a fundamental level. I started with the first song example. When the song plays the expected input from the onscreen keyboard is behind the beat. When it goes into practice mode, the metronome is 100% accurate. Back to song mode and it's off the beat again telling the musician they are incorrect. (20 year music teacher looking for apps for my students)"
"Takes FOREVER to download, and it's very hard to use. The person who does the voice-over sounds like a dehydrated horse. When you're playing the song (even if you're a beginner) if you don't push the key the exact SECOND it's on beat then it starts over. Not to mention that the keyboard on the bottom of the screen is tiny so you can't even see what key to push. My first bad review."
"Seems like a great, well designed instructional tool. . . For about 25 minutes, then you need to be prepared to shell out 75 dollars for a 3 month subscription, there is no 1 month option. Highway robbery, offer a 1 month subscription to dip the toes in at least. Don't be fooled, everything (absolutely everything. There are zero (0) free courses after the intro) is locked behind an exorbitant paywall, just use youtube."
"It's an ok app, (you do have to pay) but no matter how close it is to the speakers, I couldn't get it to recognize the note, even at full blast volume. Also, sometimes when I make a mistake and start over on a song, it thinks I messed up again when my hands weren't even touching the keyboard, and it sends me straight to practice mode."
"I've already wrote a review but it didn't post, I'm not sure why. After the 7 day trail this app charges you 89.99. So I'm guessing they charge you up front for the whole 12 months. However, that was not made clear when I was subscribing to this. This is a really neat app but I'd rather be able to pay $7 a month and cancel when I'd like. There are no options on the app to cancel. Only an email. I'm disputing this with my bank."
"I paid $90 for this app and it works so poorly. I wish I could get a refund. A couple examples: - When two of the same note are played in a row, it recognizes the first time you play the note as both the first and second note, even if you stop playing the note long before you should play the next note. This makes it so you can't play the notes properly or it acts like you made an error. - The app will often say that it can't hear my piano BEFORE it's even time to start playing"
"Within 3 days i finished the basics, I don't have any money to buy premium. You could at least give us more courses and teach us to use both hands without having to pay. I also can't even play the song cause the volume turns down completely and I can't hear anything. The notes skip and just go to the next note even when your not playing anything. If you were thinking about getting this app don't waste your time. All this app does is waste the space in your phone."
"There are 3 things I do not like about this app. 1, it wants you to pay for everything, even to play music. If you want to play piano normally. 2, I have an electronic keyboard, and even if I turn the keyboard volume up, it can never pick up the sound, or pick it up correctly. 3, if I wanted to skip the stages, I couldn't because I didn't have premium. I am an amateur pianist so all of the easy things I cant move past because of no premium. Wouldn't reccomend this app."
"I really enjoyed this app, very helpful and fun. HOWEVER, when I subscribed for 7.99 PER month I got charged $90 in the first few days. I did not agree for the full annual payment. I also would like to get a refund but there was NO option in the app to do so. Based on the other reviews this seems to be a COMMON problem. I hope they get this fixed and are more clear when we sign up."
"GARBAGE. The app is literally trash. I could not hear me playing sometimes so I had to start the song over again. And sometimes it even said I made a mistake even though I didn't. I do not recommend this app unless you want to waste your money on songs that you can bearly hear because I forgot to mention that they turn the volume down automatically. The reason they do this is because the apparently want to hear your piano or keyboard better. Sincerly, A simply piano customer."
"MIDI does not work as advertised. The song will stutter and not progress as long as the cable is connected. The app fails to make sound during this time too. The cable would be essential if it worked, because the app cannot identify chords correctly using the microphone. I'm cancelling my subscription during the free trial."
"This app was awesome up until Friday. Now it just stops picking up notes, turns everything red and is super frustrating. I've been using it since December with no issues and now it is almost unusable. I was really doing well with it too which makes it even more frustrating to think of starting over with something else. I tried tech support but they had 0 answers."
"Installed on Samsung Galaxy Tab notebook. Traps you in the app. Not easy to close or log out or cancel the subscription. Don't need that kind of manipulation. Unnecessary. As far as learning to play piano: I already play piano. It is a pretty simple teaching method and if you continue the app I think most would be able to learn to play. The level would depend on how much you ""want"" to play, and of course the level of your dedication to learn. It takes time."
"I play the correct keys but it just won't register. It doesn't teach when you play the keys. At the end start or the middle of when the line comes across the quarter note? Also, at least give us ads to continue and not have to pay. Youcision is way better with it allowing us to continue the lesson but you have the option to pay if you want to play without any limited time a day. Uninstalling and just sticking to playing by ear. Which is honestly a lot better."
This app is a joke. First of all if you have to play the same note one right after the other the app automatically picks up the note for you as if instead of playing it one time you played it 2 or 3 times. Causes you to fail and is very frustrating. There's more but I only have so much space here. Upon your subscription ending you lose all content that you already paid for and earned unless you pay again. Sports illustrated never ripped magazines from my hands when my subscription expired.
"The first part was great...and by that I mean the intro was great. The intro made the app seem easy and fun, but once I started playing it was the opposite. On the very first lesson I would hit the CORRECT note (and I know that it was the correct note because I have taken piano for 5 years) and it marked it WRONG!!! From there on the app was really glichy and kept on marking things wrong!"
"Bad in app customer support. I made an account with an email and that didnt work. I cancelled the trial and it gave me an error message. I contacted support in the app but that didn't help since you can't really talk to a person in there. I made another account with my main email and it worked flawlessly. App charged me twice for both emails. Again, I cancelled the first but the app gave me an error message and apparently kept the subscription open."
"Within the app, it didn't hear much of the sound and had to keep recalibrating, resulting in me having to keep redoing lessons because of a technical difficulty. I tried to cancel the free trial, and couldn't even figure out how to! And when they charged me, I thought it would be around 7 dollars a month, and I get charged 89.99 for the full 12 months. I requested a refund for the money, haven't got a response yet. Dissapointed in what could have been a great app. Hopefully will get a response.."
"I have to change my review. There is a bug in the software that keeps the program from recognizing the notes you are playing, especially on the left hand with chords. The answer is an MIDI cable apparently, but my keyboard doesn't have that capability, and I was not informed I would need one before paying my subscription. After a month, I can barely play anything, as the program keeps saying I'm not playing the chords. I am sorry I got this program now."
"It started as a good experience for my daughter. She started to enjoy it but then we decided to cancel the subscription and that is when the horror story began. This people don't have Customer Support, only automatic replies. I've sent multiple emails to cancel this subscription and according to what they send as instructions to do it, they don't work. Not even in App Store or in the App itself. Total Frustration!!!!!!"
"The practice seems faulty for the on screen keyboard. I could add random notes or mash the buttons and it'd count as a clear, which makes me not ready for when the song comes along. You only get two courses for the on screen keyboard, one course for an actual keyboard, then any other content is locked to premium. So if you are looking for a skill to learn for free, this app isn't it. It makes me appreciate that something like Duolingo will give me courses for free so I can actually learn."
"Theres something about the app that makes it infuriating to use to learn piano. This app made me dread wanting to practice my piano. You cant move at your own pace, and when you mess up over and over again on the same song, you will start to get more frustrated by the minute then if you were just to search for somewhere to get lessons, or just use the internet to help you self teach your self piano. Besides, you would be able to move at your own pace and play the songs you want to learn."
"Doesn't teach how children how to actually play music. It gives points for hitting the correct note but doesn't take into consideration when the note is played, if the note is played the correct number of times, and the tempo at which it is played. My 7 year old got all amped up because she was getting a high score but it sounded TERRIBLE! She was just banging the keys and randomly getting the correct notes but her score kept getting higher and higher. If your child has ADHD DO NOT use this app!"
"A It is a great week one tool. Eventually you will miss key features like: the app ignore some notes, if you faceroll the piano, the app thinks you are doing a good job, because hey! he pressed the key! It keeps jumping from practice modes, and will not let you choose. I waited some days for a response, but to no avail. I advice spening your money and time elsewhere."
the note recognition is very bad. it would say its a note next to it or something that sounds nothing like the note i played. my piano is old but its in tune and still works. i first thought it was my phone's mic but the mic wasnt bad. i asked a family member if i could test out both our mics and it was the same result. Please work on that. i was stuck at the same level trying to fix it for half an hour.
Enjoyed using it for the first five minutes. Other than the poor audio pick up and silly childish songs. Then the rest was locked behind a subscription. Would not have bothered with it had I known. Neither should you. Waste of time. Just sit down and watch a few videos and buy some old sheet music from a thrift store. Much easier and much more rewarding to learn that way.
"Our children absolutely despised this piano app. The app does not ""hear"" the note counts or notes correctly. The learning mode with the metronome does not seem to be adjustable for the tempo. We encouraged the kids to try it out for a month, but the app is more frustrating than fun. I wish I could get a full refund. Do not purchase this app until you fully sample it with your kids."
"DO NOT PURCHASE I am extremely disappointed in this app. I signed up for the $7.49 12 month subscription + 7 day free trial. For some reason I was charged $89 and in their disclaimer as you sign up it states ""no hidden fees or commitments"". There was no detailed terms and conditions. I tried to find a phone number to call but of course was only provided an email. I am currently waiting to hear back. I fully intend to file a complaint with the BBB, it sounds like Im not the only one having issues"
"UPDATE: if you are playing the acoustic piano, the later lessons are literally unplayable. You can play it correctly over and over and over and over and it won't let you progress because it won't recognize that you are playing it correctly. I am not able to progress. DON'T BE FOOLED IF IT PLAYED OKAY IN THE DEMO. Once you get to faster tempo and chords, this app WILL NOT work."
"Disappointing! The app seemed so promising & I wanted to learn to play my upright piano right away. My piano is slightly out of tune (so slight, a newbie like me wouldn't know). But the app would not let me advance because the notes were not exact. I understand this is not an issue for those with keyboards. I will invest in tuning my piano in the future, but there should be a function to calibrate the app to the user's piano so beginners like me can get started."
"You play the notes as they scroll across the screen but there is no 3/4 or 1/2 speed. You are just learning so its hard to keep up. Once you fall behind, it stops and takes you back to practice mode for just that section rather than the whole song. I end up playing 10 - 15 notes before having to start over. It's extremely frustrating and makes it impossible to enjoy playing."
"Ads are deceiving as hell. Number 1, it's not free. Almost none of these piano practice apps are, so don't be fooled. Yeah, they'll give you 10 minutes for the same select levels every time, but it's useless without pay. Two, PIANO IS HARD TO LEARN, so when they say ""3 months later"" and someone's a god at Piano, that's absolute ð§¢ It will take a while to get better at piano (I'm saying this as a beginner), but it's still worth it, so don't be tricked and instantly demotivated."
"Its been 6 days and I have called, emailed and contacted them through the app to get my $90 back and they will not respond. The phone number they provide goes to a message that tells the customer to email them. The app does not work. I started with a lot of excitement but it evaporated quickly once app stopped picking up the notes I was playing on the piano. Before this I was actually doing well and felt encouraged by my progress, but my progress was seriously disrupted and thwarted. Do not buy!"
I really thoroughly enjoyed the App prior to buying the subscription. It's been a month I'm trying to get a refund because I cannot hear the music as I'm playing my piano which makes the learning process inefficient. I've contacted support and went through all the troubleshooting but it's still not working even deleting the app and redownloading it has not worked. I'm still waiting for a refund.
Horrible. Have been trying to cancel for over a week now. Originally cancelled before trial was over. But the continue to keep attempting to charge my card. I have emails support numerous times with no response. The directions given on the site to contact them do not work as there are no such options when you select contact us. Avoid at all costs!
"I downloaded this app to test it, and I am somewhat disappointed. The deceptive ads for this app make it sound like it's worth installing and that you can learn songs for only 1 month. Guess what? It's fake. You can't learn songs for 1 month. It takes time and patience. The way this app teaches doesn't make it better. It teaches songs. It says ""Songs before Technique"" when in reality it's more like ""Technique before Songs"". I'm a piano player on Level 7 by the way."
"Just as I thought, you didn't learn piano in 3 weeks. Saw the ads, i owned a piano. So I tried to use the app. It made me very frustrated. Uninstalled it, then installed it again. I wasn't that frustrated. But, I didn't want to pay to get to learn songs. And, it doesn't teach you that well. I wouldn't want to use this everytime I wanted to learn a new song. The first two courses were good. But, the next one was a song. I forget what's next. Same with other apps. I've really heard this app alot."
"I honestly hate this app... First the app asks you 3 questions, Beginner: Middle: Advanced! I have had so many years in learning the piano, and it does the simplest things... Also, when I play the piano that is not built in the app, example: when it says to press the middle c... I do, and it says it's wrong... I would not recommend this... Horrible! I think it needs a lot of changes... I would recommend Flowkey... It is awesome!"
"At first I loved this app. But the further you progress, the worse the app becomes. When trying to learn chords the app cannot pick up the notes individually so it thinks you're not playing them and will make you fail the section and redo it over and over without an option to progress. This app would be incredible and so worth the money if it either had better audio technology or an option to over ride the audio and learn without it. 1 star also for the non existant customer support."
"Everything is locked. Horrible App. It is so bad you shouldn't waste your time. I just want a good piano app that doesn't make you buy everything. Ill watch the ads if ot means the music is ""free"". Very bad app. I don't want a stupid free trial. Most people do the free trial and forget they have it. I just want one app that doesn't try to sell me something."
"It was hard for my daughter to stick with it independently. She struggled to get past certain lessons successfuly. I tried to show her how and ended up being worse than her. After a couple of months never used it again. It was saved on her tablet, so I didn't remember I had it. Without warning got charged $150 for a second year after not using the app in the first year! Very painful investment. I was declined a refund request. I think it's unfair and unfortunate. Disappointing business model."
"Poor customer service. Hard to reach - only thru a chat whenever they respond. Email is unresponsive. The 800 # on our credit card is an automated message. We paid for the subscription and bc of user error we had to reinstall the app. The whole app reset as if we hadn't paid. It advertizes a monthly $ amount but doesn't disclose that the *annual* amount is charged. We saw the charge on our credit card. As for the app, we were progressing well but it did have glitches. We are out! â"
Disappointed. I downloaded this app to help me learn piano and was really excited with how easy it was to follow and how much progress I was making as a beginner. after completing the free section I decided to subscribe for 7.99 a month. Then on 6/10 I was charged 89.99. I don't have the money for this kind of charge. hoping for a refund.
This app is advertised as being able to show you how to do all of these cool songs on your piano or keyboard and it says nothing about the fact that you can only do basics for free. I was staring to get better and u went to mlm over on to the next level and I needed to get premium. At least make some scores available or make more advanced things premium.
"I would probably have loved using this app. However, as others have said, they do not communicate. I sent them several emails, the only response I have ever gotten is a canned message saying it'll be a while for them to contact me. They make it literally impossible to cancel your free trial, by not communicating and giving incorrect instructions on how to cancel. Their phone number goes directly to a message saying to email them."
Kept renewing despite cancellation. I cancelled the membership and it still auto renewed. It's not a cheap membership so naturally I wanted to fix the issues. There was no customer service available to talk to about the issue. Just computer generated responses that don't help. There are better apps that won't continue to steal your money. Stay away from this one.
"I have already learned the piano, and I was hoping to have a cool experience playing the songs I love. But, this app turned out to be a scam, I can only play part of one song with 3 notes. I have to get a premium membership to be eligible for other songs. This app will teach you 3 notes and that's it, unless you want to pay to learn more. This app Is not something I would recomend."
"The ads make this app looked really helpful and convenient and you're excited to start. And when you download the game, it seems like the real deal. But after you finish the basics, you realize that you need premium to do literally anything else. All you can learn is the notes C, D, E, F, and G. The ads are very deceiving."
I tried this app nearly every day for weeks.  It could never here my upright piano so it would repeat the same tune over and over.  You can't alter the tempo so in my case I was playing loudly and over and over until my hands ached.  I only progressed a few lessons.  I called tech support and their answer was to use it on an electronic keyboard plugged directly into my tablet.  I don't own an electronic keyboard and it was never my goal to play an electronic keyboard.
This app works great! Yes it is but for me only works in 1 day after signing up for 1 year. This is very unfair why is simply piano won't even let me in.. it won't even load.. it's very very very annoying! Now I'm trying to cancel my subscription but it won't even let me. What the heck is that about!!
"I signed up for the free trial understanding that the fee was $7.99 per month. no where did it say I would pay 1 fee of $89.99 for the entire year. I emailed them to request a cancel and refund,waiting on a reply. You need to make it clear when signing up that after the trial period is over you will be charged for the entire year. Please cancel and Refund the $89.99."
"So first of all all you can do is basic stuff without paying lots of money, and second my piano isn't perfectly in tune so it doesn't detect the right notes. If you want to learn how to play three notes for free this app is perfect for you. If you have a piano that is in tune and you are willing to pay a lot of money its great as well. Otherwise I would not recommend simply piano."
"This app has become a pretty iconic music app from its advertisements. I've been playing piano for 5 years, and wanted to use this app. Im currently at the basics but it wont pick up the right notes. I'll play a D4 and it'll pick up D4 and a D5 somehow. My phone is right against the speaker, so this was very irritating. Sometimes it picked up nothing at all. I suppose they spend all their money on advertisement rather than the actual app."
"Lesson section is absolutely awful. Takes all the fun out of learning, adds unnecessary stress and frustration. App does not allow you to go at your own pace. Always focusing on playing songs faster and faster. Wish i didn't renew my subscription. Lost all hope in the learning aspect of the app."
"This app did not work for me at all. I got stuck, unable to play a song midway through the second lesson. There is no speed control to slow it down. The company is very responsive and the fact that you can do the first lesson without signing up is great. They force you to use the on-screen keyboard for the first two lessons. I think that is a huge mistake. The app is highly rated, so it may be that their method just doesn't work for me. Getting stuck at level 2 is something that shouldn't happen to anyone. If my ability is THAT low, the program should still have a way to work with me to get me past that."
"For best results use a midi connection - I thought. I regret subscribing. I tried the easier lessons in the trial for 2 days and then went on vacation. After coming back I made progress to some of the songs and that is when I realised the problem. I noticed that there is a 1 second lag between key press and midi sound recognition, despite connecting a midi USB cable. This has made following along lessons really hard. I really would like to cancel my subscription and my money back."
"Having the subscription model be based on 3 month increments is reprehensible, not to mention the absurdity of charging approximately double if you select the minimum 3 months. I would get a month try the app (1 week trial isn't enough), but there is no way I can justify getting 3 for nearly 80$. You won't get any money from me with this type of pricing strategy. I wouldn't be surprised if others felt the same."
"I was very excited to use this app. I had heard a lot of great things about it. I got past the intro and to the first lesson, playing middle C. I hit the note, and nothing happened. I tried for 30 more minutes, using various techniques to try and make the app hear the notes my keyboard was playing, and it never registered one note. I don't understand why this happened, but for now I'm deleting the app."
"Some of the lessons are so annoying to complete as the timing and speed of some songs are too much. Example killing me softly and Ariso , they don't even help you with practice for you to be able to play this song without raging."
Absolutely horrible. Should be able to slow it down more. Don't recommend at all. I don't care about reading sheet music have turned it off and was hoping it would go by lettered keys. This just makes it 50x harder. Off to find a proper app.
I got the impression you have to pay subscription to access extra features and all the sheets. Turns out only the very beginning is free and after that it's a really expensive subscription. That was pretty misleading.
"This is one of the apps that u seem to actually like but then you find out that you have to pay for literally everything. I am a child with no money and my parents don't make much. I was hoping to actually learn something other than video games but then I got shot in the face with the ""with the premium pass"" for literally every thing. Experiences like these is why gamers stay gamers. To busy to do anything, but once they do try something they have to pay for it right after starting to like it."
Terrible experience and time wasted. Note recognition is terrible on moto g82. Recognizes once and then it needs louder and louder and then stops recognizing. Do not waste your time they start saying buy this app from the very first 3 minutes without showing any value. Uninstalled.
I thought it was a good app and I was actually learning. It was when it said I had to pay to keep going that I thought was stupid. The price is ridiculous and making people download the app because it's free and giving them one lesson then saying to continue you have pay. Don't waste your time unless you're willing to pay.
So my subscription is meant to be 8.49 a month and you have just taken the yearly amount of me which I can not afford. I have cancelled my subscription and will not be renewing it. Please can someone contact me about a refund before I phone the bank and the police. My details weren't even changed on here and you've somehow still managed to take payment on a bloody Sunday!!!!!!
"Cannot access songs right away. The app keeps telling me ""Almost there - Keep going to unlock tons of fun songs"". Keep going where? What the hell does that mean?"
"I didn't even get to use the app; it just played that small review of what you can do with the app, and then it remains on that screen for like, forever. There is no option for me to get out of that screen/review. I honestly expected more from this app. Please try and fix this problem."
It was a great app at the beginning but in the end it only taught me how to play the basic 5 notes and then I have to pay to be able to he taught more and I don't have the money so this was a great app if they hadn't added the paying on there for the lessons I'm Uninstall this because it won't work for me
"Got a deal offered for a yearly rate. I accidentally selected the monthly, realized I messed up and canceled to go back. The option is no longer there at all and when I contacted costumer service they said they couldn't do anything and the yearly rate was almost TRIPLE what the advertised rate was. The rate offered was $59 and the rate they told me was $149. He even stated that he saw the offer extended to me but still couldn't do anything about it. SHADY BUSINESS.....BEWARE!!!!"
Good but I don't want to be paying high prices just for the piano so now my child can't play anymore. You need to turn down the prices. plus my child is crying rn because of this so FIX IT! Plus it recognised my child's voice because they were singing because they loved Dance Monkey and the app thought their voice was a PIANO! RU CRAZY(I would rate a 0 if I could). Uninstalling
"I do like the app, but I can't give more stars since there are so many features lacking in the Android version compared to the iOS version. For example, 'Play' features a Feedback mode in iOS where you can play in your own pace. Since the code and design for these features exist, I wonder why they are missing here. Edit: After two years of silence, and no news about upcoming updates I can only reduce to 1 star. They should focus more on usability than on new pop songs. Not renewing subscribtion."
Poor communication. I bought this last year. Be aware it automatically takes a payment every year. I have tried cancelling but the app crashes every time I select to cancel. I left a 'message' telling them I want to cancel but cant . So now they've taken a second payment for a second year that I did not want.
"Gave it another try, as they had a song I really wanted to play. Instead of playing a tune I liked, I spent a frustrating hour switching from ""training mode"" to ""play with music"" (literally 1 for 1) on the same, slow boring tune... calculating when to hit the note accounting for the lag between phone & piano. At least with yousician, you can play any song in practice mode, bypassing issues: noisy environment, app lag, or piano volume too low (for those of us who have neighbours and thin walls)"
Well it was great for the first level but then you have to pay to contine its not expensive but there are similar apps that you don't have to pay for so just go to them really
"Rubbish app. Paid for a year's membership, hardly use it because the app doesn't recognise the correct notes I play. What a waste of money."
I couid not get into the app as it would not allow me to put my age in the age portion of the profile. I tried to put my age in multiple times. Poorly constructed app.
"You need to buy premium if you want to do ANYTHING on this app. You get one basic lesson, which only teaches you 5 notes. Then you need premium to do anything else. Waste of time"
"This app is absolutely rubbish, you have to pay for premium to learn anything that's not piano basics. If I could I'd give this app a zero."
I was trying to get back into playing the piano but this app made it such a slog. The practice songs would not register when I played the notes on the proper tempo which made them frustrating and tedious to complete . I didn't even bother going past Joy to the World because it would unjustly count against notes I played correctly.
"Usually it cannot hear ur piano. Although I press the key strongly , but it also can't hear it, it makes me feel harder to learnð®âð¨"
I was very impressed by this at first but as I am progressing I've noticed that I can hit almost any key and it thinks it's right. If I'm having trouble with one particular part of a song I have to practice a larger part of the song or the whole song just to practice the part I'm having trouble with and if I don't hit the replay button before it gets to the next training part I have to do it all over again. I think the option to scroll through the training would give it 4 stars.
"This app is really poor and I don't see how it encourages learning. Tried playing along & even though I can play basic tunes, I was constantly at odds with the stupid blue line. One note, it was right, next I played at same point of the blue line going across & it was wrong. No help given as to when was right time & appears to need to be so exact that it's barely useful for beginners. I only used the free app & there's no way I'm forking out over Â£100/year for it."
absolutely horrible. this stupid thing needs a subscription to do everything...literally. it's like a free demo until it asks you to get a subscription. I'm not spending my money on this trash piano app....really? and plus it doesn't even have a section where you can free play with the piano that's recording. honestly guys don't waste your time thinking it's a free app.
"The app is wonderful but my experince with their ""free trial"" is horrible. If its a 7 day free trial why was my account immediately billed $80? Im definitely disputing the charge because thats just not right. I only wanted to see about the trial and see of I wanted to buy it in the future not have it immediately take the money out the minute I chose to do the free trial"
"Playing/paying for 4 months. A back button next to reset would help a LOT when training for the harder parts of songs. For fast songs, I hate that the app continues with lots of errors at the end of a practice bar. Eg Maple Leaf. I want to play the bar perfect before continuing. Connecting to the piano's midi port helps, but I'm cursing at this app ATM. One star until improvements."
"Yousician is definitely a better and cheaper choice than this app. I attempted to try the free trial so i could see how the lessons were, and it didnt even work. I subscribed and the premium options still weren't unlocked. there aren't even as many lessons on here as yousician."
Annoy me every single time I use the app to subscribe? Also. I was premium. The app is frustrating. When premium expired I attempted to use the app in free mode. Not a fun experience at all. I have zero clue if you can even play a full album. Or what's even going on. It's just an unpleasant experience all together. I wanted to like it. Because Deezer has a few songs my 8 years sub to premium Spotify doesn't have. But alas. The app is infuriating to use.
This app is still janky. It has days where it doesn't play all and has bootleg versions of songs. It doesn't have many songs. ..It hardly plays. It crashes often and have super long delays at times. It stays stuck on loading. I have uninstall then reinstall 3-4 times to get it to play Some of the songs are knock remakes and bootleg imposter. They double charge me twice a month for 3 months now. I use to love this app. Disappointed. Fix it Deezer. I use to give you 4-5 stars.
Second time cancelation. Just discovered I've been billed for 8 months. Expect your music search to span from genre across the globe with sounds like a good idea but makes any search extremely difficult to find music from your own country without results that usually are not in your language clutter. Had to document this cancelation for Google after being charged 8 months after my last cancelation. Not happy with this site at all.
"Decent music service but redundant to other more popular services. The only reason I use this service, and the premium version at that, is because it is suppose to work with my Fitbit. But, it doesn't. Syncing playlists takes hours. Signing in to your account is spotty at best, as is the Bluetooth headphone connection. It's certainly not worth the premium fee, and really not worth the frustration even if it were free. I'd stay away if you can."
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! The music cuts out, and if a playlist downloaded, it just skips over some songs and then it just won't play them. Worst music app to ever use. If I could give it 0 stars I would. I don't understand how a song that was downloaded and working one day just suddenly has an issue the next. Or how an entire album just can't be played."
"I'll admit it, There was a lot of music tracks to choose from, but once I had set up a playlist, it pretty much played anything BUT the music in it, only ""similar"" tracks. While I understand nothing is perfect, I would appreciate it if there was a setting that let you turn that on or off, because I prefer to listen to what I choose in a playlist, not what it recommends based on it... unless that's a feature you get with the subscription, which I don't have money for"
"Can't give 0 stars, so one it is. Same old story. A couple of years of exceptional music surfing, etc., etc. Then that dreaded ""update"". You know the one. The one that has your app acting like it's been messed with one too many times! And lets not forget that wonderful ""upgrade to family plan"" popup. You know the one. The one that stops your music 10 seconds into EVERY F#@@ING SONG!! Oh. BTW, I'm single."
This used to be an amazing app but lately ð¤¦ââï¸ Stop recommending songs that I do not care about!! It's one thing to have adds but a completely different thing to play random songs that I don't have in my playlists or favorites!!! This is outrageous! I am getting really fed up with it! Please take that feature out because people don't care to listen to music that they did not choose!!! Not to mention that when I skip the stupid song that you recommended it take away one of my daily skips ð¤¦ââï¸
"Even though I have notifications turned off, the ratty thing is sending them to me. The app is good for hanging up a time, or two, every single day, too. Inconsistent sound quality, despite the apps settings. Not impressed. No, I'm not contacting you, either. You obviously have a glitch if notifications are being received after being turned off. So I blocked them within the app itself."
"Deezer use to be the best, but now it absolutely SUCKS. As a loyal customer, I have had this app for many years. Until recently it was the best musical app around. I had no problem with the price of it's service increasing, but I never would've thought the quality of it's service would decrease with an increased price. I can't listen to downloaded music or just play music in general, without getting a message that says ""Error: This content failed to play. Try again""."
"Edit 10/24/21 - When playing a playlist or artist it will throw random songs in there that are not by that artist or in that playlist. Recently has stopped playing after every song unless you have the app open on your screen, if it's in the background it'll just stop and takes a few tries to get it to play again. Now it won't even let me save new songs. Used to be good but is now unusable. Updates have not fixed the bugs at all."
Trialed the free version to see if I would want to upgrade to the paid version. There are ads after every 2 songs. Every. 2. Songs. Really hard to get a feel for the app when the flow is constantly breaking up so often. The recommendations are awful as well. Listened to several hard rock playlists and it kept jumping around genres. There's far better apps out there.
"What a bunch of trash. Spotify is better. Even soundcloud is better. ""can't select a specific track without purchasing"" Don't waste your time. Btw it was for sleepy piano music. Edit: I think apps should say in clear big words in the description of your app. Instead of a robotic response like. Deezer does not make you pay. For any feature on your app yea bud it does. At least when I tried it. If you want money don't make it where you have to buy access just to listen to a specific track. ð"
You think for what they charge a month they could have an app that doesn't just stop playing music randomly. It's extremely frustrating I had to keep going back and reopening the app just to listen to music. This app has closed unexpectedly for the last time! No more will I pay $15/mo for something that does not work. *Update* Followed the steps from the dev. comment absolutely nothing has changed. App still stops unexpectedly. Extremely frustrating!
"I would have given this 5 stars, but the app just got really glitchy today. It doesn't play any of the songs AT ALL, even though it was working fine not even an hour ago, and when I click on a song, it skips to the last one in the album and STILL doesn't want to play. If your app is gonna act all glitchy, I would like a cancel and refund on my subscription."
I'm so sick of this app. It used to run so smoothly before I upgraded to premium. Then I went back to the basic plan and now I have buffering issues where it gives me an error message and the music will quit playing until I click the retry button. It does this with every song. Even when I'm on wifi it still gives me this message. I can use Spotify with no issues but this app will continuously stop working. Definitely do not download and waste your money. There are better apps put there!!!
"Wanted to like it; ended up hating it. The mix function is essentially unusable. Over half of the songs I get are in a genre that is the polar opposite of the genre of the song the mix is supposed to be based off. And that's my one complaint. Got nothing else. I just want good solid radio without having to touch anything every few minutes. Didn't think I will ever say this sentence in my lifetime, but even Spotify has a better radio function."
"Will be looking for new song app. I Look up songs, create a list, and they still play what they want. I've listened to 10 songs of their's and not one from the list I created. You play adds after every 3rd song as well. Why create lists, when you can't listen to them. I know it's free, but come on now. Make me want to purchase it, not delete it. Stay away from this app."
"Disappointing again and again. Half of my songs are unable to listen to. I tried to delete cache, re-download, repair files, clear the storage and re-downloaded everything again. This is not the first problem I had with this app. I'm trying out Spotify for a while now, highly recommend everyone to go there."
"There's a constant error that reads ""Error: Failed to play. The requested content is not loading"". I'm sending the screenshot to the link below only because Deezer is one of few high quality music file supplier and I don't want to load my playlists over to Tidal. Please fix all the failures to load. App is updated and I reset my phone a lot. This also happens on my Astell and Kern DAP all the time!"
"I have been looking for a completely free and offline music app and so when I saw this on the play store as ""free"" and ""completely offline"" I was very disappointed to go through the trouble of putting all my favorite songs in a playlist and then trying to download them, and it says that's a premium feature. Every reason why I got rid of Spotify is the same on this app. It's just stupid how I have to pay for premium just to listen to music."
"wasted potential. you know, not everyone can afford a subscription but i understand the lack of features on a free version, but the fact that i can't even select what I want to play is ridiculous. to play a certain song I have to shuffle the entire album, and if I accidentally skip the song I want to hear you can't go back to previous song, and that to tue fact that you can only play like 5 or so song per album and it just frustrates me. I get its a free version but that's just ridiculous."
"Loving the Flow on this app, as well as downloading playlists to listen when I'm not streaming. Been saving my soul on this deployment. edit: not sure if it was something on my end but looking online I noticed I wasn't the only one getting an ""error: failed to play. Requested content is not loading"" the only workaround I've noticed is if I download the whole album or playlist then itll play songs but streaming is almost nonexistent. Cancelling my Premium"
"By far the worst app and music subscription I have ever tried. I have a huge library of music i listen to. So when i tried migrating all my music. It only allowed 2,000 songs in my favorites and the rest i had to put in playlists. The app is so slow, takes forever to load, I even did a full reset on my phone and then realized it's the app. The only good thing about this app is the hifi quality. Overall worse app and subscription. I'll stick with spotify"
It worked in the beginning when they were partnered with cricket but after they went separate the app is constantly having issues. I constantly have to uninstall and reinstall to get the songs to play because they always read something along the lines of 'Error: cannot play.' And gives me the options of retrying or quitting. I'm tired of doing it and its inconvenient. This is not what I pay you for.
"I paid for unlimited streaming and having my music throttled for skipping tracks (ex. flipping through an old playlist) isn't unlimited. That ""it's a Sonos security feature"" is garbage. Also your interface with Sonos is terrible. You can only use the very limited sonos app, but can't cast from the Deezer app, so forget switching between your living room to another bluetooth device. I was looking for a new service after Google Music shut down and this is not it."
"Well that was a waste. Have to sign up for a subscription to play a song after sign in. No. Going back to Spotify. At least they don't force you to pay right off the bat. We have the option to listen for free with a few ads here and there, or go premium. Uninstalled ð¡ *update* What I mean is, it wouldn't let me see the 'free' section at all. I selected my band I wanted to hear and tapped play. And it threw up the subscription pop up. And I couldn't go any further. So thank you anyway."
"If you like a music streaming app where 50% of the time the next song ""failed to load"" or you have to go to the next song manually because it won't automatically go to the next song, then Deezer is for you. You will also like Deezer if you like an app that doesn't load the correct album cover for the song playing then just glitches and ""loses"" your current shuffle list so you have to start over and reshuffle. I, for one don't like any of that and say Deezer sucks. ð"
"I had a trial subscription and Deezer worked perfectly. That expired. The day after I signed up for the 99 cents Premium Account for 3 months, NO MUSIC WILL PLAY. Every song just continues to load or say wait a few more seconds but no music. I've Force Closed it, cleared the memory, restarted my phone, nothing. I loved Deezer up until now, told some people about it bragging on it. Very disappointed in this app now."
"Horrible. I am impressed with the audio quality...HOWEVER, whenever I launch a song track mix for the song I like...(like start station for pandora).... it will play the same 5 songs over and over even when I select ""do not recommend"". Also the related songs which are supposedly added to the ""station' aren't even related! I tried a song station for a Christian song I really like...and it started playing explicit rap and hip hop songs....one of them in Spanish."
"I used to like Deezer, but over the past few years.., (I have been a loyal Deezer premium subscriber for many years now) it's just a HUGE HASSLE! Won't play most songs on a lot of albums that are available on other music services free versions. No option to sign in to my paid premium account on the app I downloaded on a new device, because only option is to choose a premium service. NO SIGN IN. So, I can't add my new device if I can't sign in to my account! Think I'll just cancel my subscription"
"I came to this app to expect offline listening since I was traveling on the road for a few days with my family, and it turns out my internet connection cuts off every once in a while in my car, but the last thing I did NOT want to do was pay for offline listening with the premium option. I understand that this app wants to make a bargain with good deals and such, but I can't get a break with so many music apps that say that you can listen offline, when you have to pay for it. It's disappointing."
Nothing but issues with the cast button. Seems as if all these music players use the same caster. Tidal amazon both stopped casting to my vizio sound bar. It picks it up but won't complete the transfer. And this one won't work right with nothing. I've tried Chromecast I've tried Google home and I have tried my Vizio sound bar with Google audio built into it. And if I do get it to play on Google home it just stops and if I play it on Chromecast it says that somebody else is listening. ð
"This was one of the only two music apps that work with my Fitbit so I tried it but I hate the app for 2 REASONS. Reason #1: I tried of the music scan option to get tracks I liked, half the time It didn't even recognize the tracks that I was playing and I couldn't test the what the song sounded like see if it was a correct match and they're all from the same album which is terrible for a song recognition. Reason #2: playlists are terrible in the app when I hit play I get random junk."
"The most annoying bugs, that make me feel frustrated: - An add is shown in the top, everytime I do a coldstart. I use premium subscription, this is unacceptable - Play button doesn't work after restoring the app from background, need to re-run the app to make it work Anything else seem fine to me. This could be a 5-star app, without these bugs"
"3 months ago the Playlist wouldnt play in the correct order & would only play a handful of songs. Now, whenever I have my Playlist on, if I leave the app open with the music playing and then go back to the app it will stop playing the current song and skip back to the very beginning of the Playlist, every, single, time. If I try to scroll down my Playlist to select a song it will force the page back to the top of my Playlist. Every few months there's a new issue that makes streaming impossible."
"Malicious practices of spamming you with a chain of 5-6 of the same ads in a row for every few songs. Full screen ads that prevent you from closing the app. Renders your phone unresponsive during the ads, so you're forced to listen to them. Plays songs that arent on your favorites/specific playlists unless you buy premium. Total shitshow of an app."
"""Would you mind telling us what we did wrong?"" Yes. I made many reviews on here and sent feedback multiple times. Xbox crashes always. Phone cannot control playback on xbox. I should be able to search a song on my phone and have it play on the xbox. Why even link my account to xbox at that point? Force me to leave a game just to skip a song. Favorite button doesn't register. Plays edited versions of explicit songs I already favorited. Needs a ""play only explicit version of songs"" option."
"6/17/21 Now It tells me that my downloaded music isn't available. I made sure everything was updated at home and then switched to offline mode for my flight. No songs! Fix it!! Starting to hate this app! Always doing something weird to interfere with my music listening. Latest is when I try to change storage location to sd card, it gets stuck on the location window and will not allow me to go further. Fix it please!!!! Stop with the amateur hour."
"0-*s. worked great in the beginning then it asked to update. After that, it just started to freeze up for no reason, It takes 4ever to start up and only displays the songs that are in my library b4 the 1st update. Always saying that it's downloading songs when I don't have app open. Takes 4ever to change to a different song and longer when searching for new ones. Will be my last month with this subscription. I'm tired of this extremely slow srvce. 2 bad only have 500 chrctrs to describe app."
"The app is disappointing. I got my hopes up only to be let down. I continuously got an error message that content can't load. And no matter what, the issue was not fixed. So now I will be looking elsewhere for my music needs. Every time there is an update the app glitches out and I have to keep resetting, reinstalling, and troubleshooting. Sadly is it only good replacement I have found for Google music"
"Come on Deezer, do I really have to go back to Spotify? Worked great a first, loved the ""Flow"" feature that seems to mix all liked artists in a random playlist, BUT. But for the last six months or more Deezer constantly fails to play the next song or stops halfway into a song. If Deezer can't play songs consistently it has no value, despite at least three updates, still same problems. I guess it's back to Spotify even though I like Deezer variety better. Fix this error playing songs."
"I finally did it. I cancelled my subscription after adding everything to Spotify. I love Deezer, but they don't have as large of a catalogue as Spotify. Spotify premium costs the same and has all of the songs that Deezer has removed from their service. This feels similar to ending a bad relationship, but I feel a lot freer to listen to more songs that Spotify has. Thanks for a good 5 years, Deezer."
"was one of my favorite streaming apps, until about 6 weeks ago. can't seem to play more than 2-3 tracks at a time before getting an error that it can't retrieve the next track. have to hit retry and it starts playing again. canceled my subscription. not worth it to have to stop what I'm doing every five minutes to restart the music"
"Terrible customer support. Was charged during free trial. Was after a specific service 360 to see if I liked it. Wasn't clear it wasn't available. So tried to do it and then find out I was charged. They tried to offer the ""free trial"" after the fact but would not return payment. So IT'S NOT A ""FREE TRIAL"" I PAID FOR IT! Cancelled my subscription because of this extremely poor business practices. Beware... There are other better services out there. Please check into other 360 offerings"
"I used to love Deezer but now I constantly have issues with getting songs to load. Songs can take up to 5 minutes to load. If I jump over to YouTube Music songs play fine but Deezer just continues to be stuck loading l. When I try to force close the app Deezer gets ""stuck"" in my notification bar and won't close. I have to restart my phone to get it to work again. Extremely frustrating. I cancelled my subscription and went back to YouTube Music."
"I have been a premium member of Deezer for years and was In love with it, until recently. I have downloaded songs that obviously the file it corrupted and will attempt to ""repair file"" but nothing happens. Also, what happened to the ""delete song from the playlist?"" That was one of the main features I liked but now, once you download a song, your stuck with it forever! More issues but out of room to explain.Seriously looking at other music apps at this point. Deezer, why change a good thing?"
"This was working great until the recent updates. The past 2 or 3 have been horrible. I haven't been able to play my playlists. When I click on them, all that plays is song ads; I listened to 10+ songs straight that weren't on my lists. I'm using the new reinstalled update right now but so far none of my lists play. There r also error messages regarding logging in, the server and API authority. Before this new update, I complained in-app about the playlist problems. The error messages r new."
"The app is so janky and buggy, that it makes it nearly impossible to have a consistent listening experience. It will show the wrong album art and song titles, it rearranges the queue on it's own, and half the time it says music I search for is unavailable, even when I have it downloaded to my device. I am not pleased."
"Terrible. The selection of music sucks, it's way too difficult to navigate, and it's always crashing or straight up glitching. I remember removing a song from my favorited playlist and it was still there even though I exited the app completely. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else like Musi."
"The app doesn't not funtion anymore. Instead of playing music there is a loud squelching noise that is like horrible feedback. All othere app on my machine play fine but not deezer. Tried uninstall/reinstall and it still happens. This seems to have started with your ""new updated deezer"" from a few days ago. Please fix or I will have to cancel service ASAP."
"Terrible. 1) Deezer won't load all of my songs. 2) When a track plays it plays the speed at 2x. 3) When I choose from one of their ""mood"" playlists, it incorporates songs from my personal playlist that aren't on the original. It's just awful all around. Don't waste your time."
"TELL ME WHY when I make a playlist, it starts to play songs i didnt choose at all?!? I selected a handful of songs, and it starts to play irrelevant music with no way to close out of it or skip it. I was looking for an easy-to-use no bs app and i guess ill have to look somewhere else. So frustrating."
"Loved the app during trial. When I had to use free version, it was as if they were vindictive. They would play 2/3 of a song and then switch to a song totally out of my genre (dance to country). Because of their poor business tactics I will never purchase their subscription ( like I was going to do when I got paid). Thank God I figured this out before purchasing. Sorry some of us live paycheck to paycheck! Times are tough and right now is not the time to be taking advantage of people."
"How is Deezer different from Spotify? It isn't, its actually worse. Know how you have some control of your music in Spotify? Not in Deezer, It doesn't matter if you go to the artist, your playlist or favorite songs list, it plays whatever it wants, whenever it wants to. Every other annoying thing is the same as Spotify. I'm sorry, I'm a bit of a venting mess about this app and Spotify, I hate them. I recommend SongFlip (I'm in No way being paid to say that) Try them out and decide for yourself."
This app was brilliant and sound quality amazing but it's started playing randomly and I like to start at the start. Particularly on favourites and albums. I have deleted and reinstalled but no change. Must have a bug but if it can't be resolved I will have to cancel my subscription which quite honestly I don't want to do
Terrible! I used Deezer Premium for 2 full years now. Today I noticed that they suddenly changed the subscription price from 6.99â¬ to 10.99â¬ without ever informing me about extra charges. I have no idea how long I've been paying 11â¬ for it. I am unsubscribing immediately and quitting this terrible service.
"Constantly stops playing. The app will play one or two songs and then display an error. It's infuriating. I have followed all advice on reinstalling, clearing cache, and even replacing memory. This was once great, but now it's trash. I'll be moving to Spotify shortly."
"Love this app and the platform until it crashes at least 2-3 times a day, randomly stopping any music playing and disappearing from recently used apps. Frustrating when you're trying to use it for focus music at work, over strong and fast wifi. This never happens with Spotify!"
"What a disappointment. I came here from Spotify premium to try this app's HiFi content but I'm disappointed at the slow buffering time of the songs. How am I supposed to appreciate your Hifi content if all I get is ""Loading... Almost there. Only a few seconds left"". Good thing you have a 30 day free trial cause there's no way I'm gonna pay for an expensive premium plan and can't even listen to HiFi music properly."
"This app deserves 5 stars. However, they changed it so when you click ""favorite tracks"" they play whatever they feel like with your favorites mixed in. I have 5 country songs, the rest are christian (mandisa, casting crowns, matthew west, ect.) Well, to promote their subscription they play techno or anything they want, so i click ""do not recommend this artist"" and it now counts as a skip. I am about to delete and just use the radio. There is no ""christian"" or ""worship"" genre. Sad."
"Whilst I love the app itself and the choice of music and podcast, it seems impossible now to listen to downloaded content and often I cannot even access it, the app treating me as if I would not pay a monthly fee via Orange. Subscription cancelled at Orange and it won't let me subscribe directly. Guess need to switch to a keener competition..."
The Samsung smart TV APP has the worst UI as a matter of fact it shows it was last updated on 10/05/2021. Another thing there are so many songs without lyrics by this I mean songs that other music streaming services have lyric your app doesn't have.
No add to queue/play next.. if I loose WiFi or data I can't even use the app for the stuff I've already downloaded. Just two very important features which make this completely unusable at times.. cancelled premium and going elsewhere
"Deezer doesn't have the option to skip tracks you don't want to hear anymore. Spotify is a million times better. I did write support as advised here this is what I got: 1/ use the don't recommend option. Nope this only means they won't recommend the track in mix 2/ use the next button. Nope this is manual skip. Not only deezer doesn't have a skip option, but the support don't even know what it is. Don't believe the guy posting like robot to contact support, falsely implying skip exist in deezer"
"Been using deezer for yrs and loved it, subscribed to premium. I recently found out that I was in 3 data breaches!! Was never notified about any of this! Started digging even deeper and found they have been sharing all my info with FACEBOOK and others. Tried to stop the sharing and wouldn't let me. Also tried to cancel and it's been hell!! BE CAREFUL AND CHECK YOUR ACCOUNT ALL OF IT!!"
"Very UNCLEAR how to delete your account. The Community page references an ""Account Settings"" section you can access from your browser and delete the account there. Well, you CAN'T find it on the page. Here are the steps I took to delete my account: 1. Google ""Deezer Acount Settings""; 2. Click the ""Account Settings - Deezer"" result. Don't be deterred by the convenient ""No page information is available."" The page IS clickable, Deezer just prevented Google from creating a page description. A**holes"
"Been using the app for 2 years and it's still full of bugs. Plays one song in favourites shows failed to play error for next song. Edit playlist move song, song plays in the wrong order, swiping down does not refresh it. I have to delete and reinstall to get it to work then download all songs again."
This app is so annoying at times it makes me want to stop paying for it. It takes forever to load my downloaded music and it deletes some of my music too. My music will just randomly stop playing or the app will close out on it's own. Not worth the money. If I could give it no stars I would.
Junk don't download. I downloaded this app to get points from Adgate. I did everything they requested and even signed up for the 30-day free trial. Deezer refused to give me my points through Adgate. Do not download they will not pay you your points. This is the first and only app that has refused to pay my points.
"All other music platforms cost R100 or less for family packages and somehow Deezer thinks it's worth R130. With increases most likely to continue as it is not a yearly increase, but sporadic. The only reason I am still with Deezer is because it is a mission to move over to another platform. But if these increases don't stop, it might become worth the effort to move over."
"Frustrating!! I get an ""Error: Failed to Play"" after every song. So i have to reastart the app. I clear the cache, i uninstalled and reinstalled but nothing is changing"
"""Error: Failed to Play"" ""The requested content is not loading"" Every single song for the last few days, tried everything including reinstalling. I was looking for a HIFI alternative to Spotify but clearly Deezer isn't the answer when the service is down for multiple days on end."
"I left one star in September 22 and i leave one star again in December 22. Now my playlist is playing backwards. (Still the same in March 2023. Ridiculous). It doesn't play your most recently added in descending order and when you change the direction, you're starting at the very beginning of your playlist and the recently added becomes last. It completely ruins the flow of my playlist and is really annoying. I've complained and nothing from Deezer. I'll be going elsewhere."
"Unreliable and therefore annoying app.. been using it for a year or so, after so many updates app just doesn't work reliably, drops out, no sound coming out many times, annoyed so much, uninstall looking likely.. thumbs down Deezer"
"NAO PERCAM SEU TEMPO COM ESSE LIXO. Deezer Ã© um lixo. NÃ£o importa se estÃ¡ usando Wifi ou 4G, leva 3 horas pra carregar uma Ãºnica musica na pesquisa,LIXO. Deezer is worse and worse. Thinking seriously about replacing it with Spotify. Deezer takes a lifespan and a half to load the content you search meanwhile on YouTube app, which I haven't even subscribed in, it happens in a snap."
Premium user. 1. Why does Deezer forget last track played in Android Auto once i disconnect from car and play direct from phone??? 2. Why can't you work out random play. Instead Deezer mixes up your music but in the same order every time.
"Some issues keeping it from 5 stars. 1. Some songs you don't have 2. Songs in my library change to 'clean' versions and some songs say they are not available on my country but I have it saved in my library. Other than that Deezer is a keeper! NOTE - Had to change my rating to 1 star due to the app constantly pausing the music for no reason. I then have to manually pause and play to resume music. Everything worked, what happened??"
App doesn't work. Asking to reload all the time when you trying to open. It's time to move on to different platform. Thanks for all years of good music ð¶
"Just installed the Deezer app and tried logging in on my Android TV, only to find I need to upgrade to premium for it to work. Uninstalling. What a total waste of time and data."
"Your app keeps crashing every 30 minutes or less!!! I cleared the cache, uninstalled and reinstalled it again, still had the same problem. I have a good internet connection. and the phone has 8Gb of ram. I don't have battery saver on. And Deezer app has permission to work in the background. so you need to fix some bugs."
Recently theres been an update where they will play 5 or so of the songs on your playlist then play every other song in existence. Spotify does this too and it's the main reason i use deezer instead of spotify but now I'm contemplating deleting it. I wouldn't reccomend this app.
"After the update, the android app home page shows me that I was listening to something that I would never dream of listening to, and it suggests listening to things that have nothing to do with the type of music I normally listen to. I don't know what you were doing, but your algorithm went crazy. I'm frustrated but also annoyed by the inability to make an honest application. Honestly, I'm thinking of switching to Spotify because at least there the algorithm works as it should."
"""Hmmm Something went wrong please retry"" press red the retry button and I get "" Hmmm Something went wrong please retry"" it's the same thing each time I try to use the app, I guess I'll just cancel it immediately before it charges me 10.85 a month for something that still doesn't work. 6 months now , still saying"" Hmmm Something went wrong please retry? I'm running android 12 on a brand new 1500 dollar cellphone and I've got unlimited Verizon Internet, this app just doesn't work."
"Have had to edit from 5 to 1 star... After Christmas every time I use flow I get exactly 3 Christmas songs every 10 ""regular"" songs. I have unlinked all Christmas songs and albums but this has no effect... Flow is now completely useless and was the main reason I used the app"
Was good but not now. Had a premium subscription which i can no longer afford. Now if use app there is an ad after every song i listen. Thanks but no thanks dont mind some adverts but that really is taking it to the extreme.
"Terrible I just lost all my songs this is really a Terrible experience beeeeeeen trying to send an email to reset password but still can't receive it, tried logging in to my old my old account it says can't login with phone number this really sucks"
"Was amazing since more than 4 years till recently, struggling to play music. I am using a samsung running android os 13. It shows loading with the spinner and remain as is. Even after a clear cache or clear data! Please fix that"
"Not for me, playing songs and artist never heard before and don't have a choice unless signing for subscription uninstalling. Radio Garden app is much better 1000s of online stations any genres and no ads my #1 choice"
"What is going one with the app? In the last several months, app crash almost always on opening. Only mitigation so far is re-installing, which I did 10 times now. But now, I am just going to delete"
"I used to enjoy this app! But now I seem to have lost all my music! As nothing loads, when I click on the app! Do yourself a favour and don't download or rely on this app to play music!!!!!!"
"App keeps crashing after 5 minutes. Tried restarting, and then unistalling. Tried clearing my cache. Nothing fixes it."
"I totally regret to having signed a 1 year premium account. The app has too many bugs, zero android auto funcionality and had no major update for years."
"Was super excited to start using deezer then discovered i cant play an album in order or exclusively one artist, there is always an unwanted ""mix"" and no setting to disable this Onto the next streaming app"
"App on pixel watch is broken. Unable to download a playlist. The download constantly freezes at the end. Customer support is useless and continues to tell me to take the same steps I've taken several times prior. YouTube Music, here I come. Edit: Customer service proves my point by responding to this review to ask me to try and option ove tried already and the problem persists. It's a joke."
"Generally alright but too buggy to recommend. Flows crash if you try to skip too many songs. No button to play the previous song most the time. The ""play next"" option appears inconsistenty; I should always be able to set something to play next. The app spends noticeable time loading the next song."
Today is the day I give up on Deezer after almost 5 years of paid subscription and almost 10 years of having an acount there. From January 2023 they changed the fee without any notice from 4.99â¬/month to 10.99â¬/month. A more than double cost for the same services and the same bugs they have in the app and i cannot stress this enough without any notice.
"used to be great. but lately, proper glitches. can't be bothered explaining why, doubt it will improve."
Errors everytime. Nothing plays. Rage mode. This app is terrible... Deserves 0 stars its so bad. People pay for this garbage service have some pride and make a better app already. Edit: Still trash pausing and loading every second damn if you guys went bankrupt that'd be great.
This app sucks they really push getting the premium account with video ads and the increasing number of advertisers including the ad for premium it constantly kicks me out for no reason
"I've been a premium user for 5+ years, during which time I've felt like the user experience on Spotify has been gradually eroding. Lately, they're pushing their ""AI"" technology and trying really hard to make Spotify more of a visual/social app. It's been very off-putting, if your goal is to enjoy listening to music. But the nail in the coffin was the recent removal of the option to make a radio station out of a playlist. This was truly the best feature, and enough of a loss to make me cancel."
"Spotify has some of everything that I love to listen to. However, the app is always pausing on its own. Half of those times what was playing restarts or goes back by minutes. That is unbelievable annoying. I can't get through 20 minutes of content without it pausing 20 times. I've tried everything. Still the problem persist. I even tried the free trial for premium and then paid 1 month. Still terrible experience. It always paused and reset on me. Wouldn't pay for it again."
"I love listening to music often, especially on here because the user experience has been great. But recently the UI had just been terrible. Get the smart shuffle out of my normal shuffle button. It causes a delay and I don't want it anyway. Also, the playlist folders. Why am I not allowed to move playlists out of folders? I have tried googling solutions and nothing works. I don't want to have to make duplicates of all my folders and lose the dates that I created the original playlists. Fix this!"
"This app was amazing until the most recent update to make it like tik tok. No one asked for this and it's harder to browse for music and find new songs. I find myself listening to old playlist now cause the single swipe to ""browse"" music is so clunky and bad. If you're going to do a major change like this that completely changes the way the app is used. Please allow people to go back to the old navigation. EDIT: Thank God they changed the home screen back to the way it was."
fix the video issues already. All of a sudden again after it seemed like the problem went away. I can't watch videos while I'm connected to Bluetooth in my car. I'm not driving. I'm Just using the radio. Every other app connects to Bluetooth and plays video just fine except for this. Ridiculous. It has nothing to do with the car and it's Bluetooth system. It's an add-on Bluetooth adapter. I don't care if the video plays on the cars nav. Just play on my phone so it stops going to sleep.
"If you don't spend money on premium this app is unbearable. The ads are annoying but they don't really bother me much. My problem is that it constantly ""suggests"" new songs according to your tastes, but 1) they're never to your tastes, the picks are terrible. And 2) it's impossible to disable the feature, even if you turn off autoplay. As soon as you change to a premium plan it stops, which means Spotify knows how much users hate it but keep the only way to disable it locked behind a pay wall."
"The music queue is the most non-intuitive, confusing thing I've ever dealt with in a music app. U can't go back and forth in the queue, once a song has played u have to do gymnastics to get it back in the queue. I don't even know how to play the song I just listened to, it's like it disappeared. On top of all that, I'm on wifi and the quality is choppy, like an old cd."
Too limited! I use a Samsung phone the s22 ultra plus and it's just way too limited. It's ridiculous. If this works best for apple phones then just list it as such. I have no issues with that and I'll stick with Pandora. You can't rewind songs or put in a song and have it play it. It's kind of frustrating. I don't want to pay for any music plans. Only thing I like is at the end of the year it gives you that year in review ð¤£ð¤£ð¤£ There is also way too many ads! Pandora has half as many ads.
"If you're using a PC, this app is great. The ads aren't excessive, the app is usable 24/7, it's easy to use. But when you're on mobile, everything turns for the worse. There are usually two ads on a row when you open the app, and once they're over you can't even listen to the song you want. It just picks a random song in the same genre. If I want to listen to a specific song, it won't let me. Then after 30 minutes, there is two ads again. This app is a complete waste on mobile."
"The updates are making it worse. Some like lyrics are great additions. They add it the experience and don't get in the way. Others like smart shuffle, which you can't turn off, get in the way and make it harder to enjoy MY playlists that I created. Sometimes I want to shuffle my playlists, but please don't add in music that is not in those playlists. I like discovering new stuff just not in my playlists. Also, the new homescreen I feel is pretty hard to use and just worse than what it was before"
"Edit 4/21/23 - very happy to see the homepage back to normal. Glad Spotify took our feedback into account! The new homepage layout (3-2023) is absolutely awful. If you're going to change the layout, at least let it be customizable. Where did my recently played list go?? This is ridiculous. It wasn't broken, why ""fix"" it? I have been a loyal premium Spotify user for years now, but if this is the new homepage.... I'll take my money elsewhere. It is awful, hard to navigate, and super frustrating."
"I was a big fan of spotify for the longest time but over the last year it has had a steady decline. Spotify has multiple issues when it comes to connecting to Google home/minis. Sometimes you're lucky if it stays connected with your music, and other times it will stay connected but run the same song for literally hours with nothing playing. I'm also not the only one with this problem. The forum I found about this happening was from early 2018 and there still hasn't been a fix action!!"
The free version of this app is absolute garbage now. I didn't like it 5 years ago when it's ads weren't correct. Now they limit you to 6 skips and when you search for a song and click on it all it does is start a shuffled playlist with that song. So now you can even listen to the music you searched for and selected. I was planning and getting premium again in a month and I just wanted to add a song to a playlist.l but now this free version pushes me away from this app.
"Spotify needs to stop putting out releases that aren't tested. Once one of the best apps on my phone. Now I have numerous issues of one song playing on repeat, hitting random and it playing the same 6 songs on the Playlist over and over again. The ""smart"" shuffle seems to be the ""feature"" that broke this app, it now makes turning shuffle on and off a painful process especially when I don't have internet connection (but my Playlist is saved to my phone). Overall this app has become riddled w issu"
"Something happened to the ""home"" screen and now it's like a feed that autoplays everything, even though I've turned off all autoplay options I could, and there is one huge item per screen, instead of a compact list of recently played stuff. When developers make changes like this to the UI and don't allow users an option to put things back the way they like to use it, it's not a good sign for the app. Please allow us to make the UI usable again. This is absurd."
"I had to cut back spending due to pandemic and other stuff and switch back to free....what the frickin hell did you do this app? This is absolutely terrible. I have absolutely no access to the 40 hours of music I've put together...unless I put it on random and deal with ads every 2 songs. Trying to edit it is like pulling my hair out. I gave you people a lot of money over the past 10 years, this is not how you treat a loyal customer. You better fix the bs free version nonsense."
"New Update is horrible, instead of the app conveniently placing my go to playlists at the top of the home screen they're trying to look more like a Netflix home page with a ton of useless irrelevant stuff before you can get to the stuff you actually listen to, if you can even find it. Just because you think you need to change something to stay current doesn't mean you're right. I'm extremely disappointed by this I may just switch to Amazon music."
"What once was a functional app has now become a phone throwing game. It tells you you're not connected to the internet when you are, forgets which songs you have downloaded, etc. Ridiculous for a paid service to be so horrible. It used to work. I guess they decided it would be cheaper to not let anyone stream. Once upon a time you could control songs from the phone's drop-down menu. Not anymore. Just keeps getting worse."
The app worked great until the update. If they go back to the old Spotify I would use it again. The update made it so you can't pick what songs you want to listen to in a playlist. I used to be able to rewind songs and skip them. The update has changed that. Was 5 stars when I started to use it a couple months ago now I can't control what I listen to so 1 star.
"The app always turns on when I connect to any Bluetooth device. Car, ear buds, or any speaker will automatically play the last thing I was listening to as soon as it connects. I checked online for a fix and it looks like this has been an ongoing issue for YEARS. How can a huge company like Spotify not fix something customers have been complaining about for years. They need to hire new developers because this app is annoying. JRE was the reason I hesitate to uninstall, but I'm doing it anyway."
"Why do you keep making the ui worse? Sometimes when I click a song after searching for it, I just want to add it to my Playlist quickly. A few times i have tried to click a song to add it to a Playlist, only to be met by over a minute of ads, so i just close the app. And why can't you list all the songs that are on an album? And when I do tap a song in search why does it take me to an absolutely awful Playlist you made instead of the album or artist page? Fix it. I'm no longer a premium member."
"Save for the misleading ""free trial"" when signing up, everything has been working fine for the app until a few minutes before writing this on the 11 May, 2023. Tried watching a video episode of a podcast, but I couldn't full screen the episode, nor could I like the song, add it to a playlist, or even view the episode information, or any other episode's information, without either getting a ""something went wrong"" message or a ""Go online to see menu"" message. Nothing I do is solving this issue."
"Ten years ago one would pay for a song. Now I'm essentially renting the ability to play music. What's frustrating is spotify can just up and decide to change the prices and rules whenever they so choose and the money I've stuck into it is gone. What sets me off is how sneaky and greedy they are. ""Premium members don't have commercials"", but that only applies to music not podcasts. You can have a 10 minute podcast with 4 minutes of commercials. It's disgusting."
"I can't even play a single song without it giving me a random song that I don't like or never heard of. Same thing with listening to albums. It shuffles the albums and puts random songs at the end. If you want to turn off shuffle, you have to pay. It's ridiculous how money-thristy Spotify has become. Nobody can listen to music without shuffle, ads, or the ""get Spotify premium"" pop-up. I don't recommend this app. Everything has to be paid for and it's annoying."
"The ""TikTok UI"" update has virtually broke the app's functionality for music browsing and discovery. I want the home page of a music app to be like a music store, with tables of albums, genres, and artists to sift through and discover. The new home page is more of a billboard taking up my entire screen to yell at me about podcasts. It's really bad and I'm considering cancelling my subscription for a competitor if this doesn't change."
"Moving to Apple music. This update just ruined it. Now I can't play music from my favorite songs, and I can just hear the preview. And when I click to play it, there is a different song playing and always an ad. I haven't gotten that many ads before. infact, never. I'm warning yall, don't get the app. The whole update just ruined it."
"I had a good experience with the app at first, but today, I was unable to choose any song in my playlist. It told me that my free trial had ended, but I never wanted to try premium, nor did I ever sign up for the free trial at any point. Because of this, I'm forced to shuffle through my playlist with all my favorite songs on it, with 600+ songs on that one playlist alone. I used it yesterday and had no problems until today. Extremely disappointed and dissatisfied. Thanks a lot, Spotify."
"Spotify is a great app on Desktop. Nice and easy, pretty lightweight and intuitive. Spotify sucks on mobile. You can only play your liked songs in Shuffle unless you pay Spotify a monthly fee. You only can skip a few times in shuffle, and having a playlist is a joke cause it will play ""suggested songs"" (not a togglable feature btw) before you even reach the end of your playlist. If it was like the desktop app then I'd use it, but I think I'll just stick with YT Music for now. Just disappointing."
"Always throwing in the same song to whatever mix I'm listening to. Recommended mixes are not interesting or varied enough. Interface is cluttered with stuff I don't want. Albums are always at least a couple clicks in, app only cares about the songs with the most clicks. I don't want recs based on my playlist, I've made playlists so that I can hear those specific songs. I want to find new stuff. Another household user who has no playlists gets all the good stuff going with his algorithm. â¹ï¸"
"Your updated ui is terrible. The goal of a music/podcast app is to maximize the amount of time listening and minimize the amount time looking for music/podcasts. Having everything in a vertical column of single tiles defeats the purpose of both. Spotify is a music/podcast app. It's not supposed to be tiktok for music. I've been using Spotify for years, but I am switching to YouTube music."
"There are so many glitches. Sometimes it stops in the middle of a song for no reason and all you can do is restart the song and it stops in the middle again. It's a vicious cycle. You have to use a skip to get to the next song but the next song does that too but you only get six skips an hour. I don't want to keep listening to the same partial song. When the ads come on, they are the same ones everytime. I'm deleting Spotify."
"It reminds me every time I open it to ""allow it to run in the background"" and tries to take me to settings... no matter how many times I set to be available in the background, it still shuts off every time I navigate away from the home screen or if the screen just times out and goes dark. Talk about a battery drain! Hopefully this is fixed soon because I'm not paying for this garbage for another month."
"I switched to Spotify from Amazon music because Amazon music kept crashing and not playing songs. Now, after the update, Spotify keeps crashing. When I do get a song to play, after 30 seconds, Spotify stops that song and goes to the next song. I just want to go to the gymð­ Also Spotify keeps connecting to some random Nokia with the remote control feature. I have my own wifi with a password that no one else has access to. My Bluetooth is set to only my devices."
"Use to be the best. I recently updated my app, and even with perfect internet, I can't play a single song past the first 5 seconds without it suddenly stopping like my internet has gone off. This use to happen on occasion and it would required a regular app reinstalling, but this time there's no solution. No notice as to what the issue may be, and nowadays there are a ton of other music apps that give me way less problems than Spotify."
"It's super glitchy. Stops playing at random moments and will often repeat the same cycle of songs. Also, customer support has not been helpful. They just say to restart and reinstall, which I've done several times. Reading over how many other users encounter these same problems, I gotta say, it sure seems like the problem's on Spotify's end Edit: and, of course, Spotify responds asking if I've done a reinstall ð"
"While Spotify is a nice service, the app is a steaming pile of garbage. Only 6 skips without premium, you can't look at specific songs without it being shuffled into a mix, and your Liked Songs has a chance to turn into Suggested Songs at any moment. While this can all be fixed with Premium, this can also all be fixed by using Spotify on any other device. I write this after trying to listen to my Liked and getting Suggested instead. If you want to listen to music on mobile, YT Music is better."
"I've used Spotify since 2011, have been along for the ride as it has grown and evolved. The new home screen has me lowering my star rating because the quality has gone down. It's trying to rip off reels and tiktoks. For the first time since using this platform, I'm beginning to question what other music service I'll use instead."
"I've been a paying Spotify subscriber for nearly 8 years now. The app used to be fantastic, but now the listening history has disappeared, and the controls is almost never on the home screen or the pull down tab. These features are imperative to my use of Spotify. I've done everything that ""Spotify Cares"" on Twitter (seemily the only source for ""official"" Spotify assistance) has recommended to me. Seriously considering terminating my subscription because of the lack of functionality."
"Unusable on Sumsung Galaxy s20 FE. Additional info. Was semi-stable, I mean, it struggled to load & play without packet loss regardless of high-speed data or roaming cell signals. Very choppy & UI would freeze when moving between search/settings. That's before the last few updates. Since the updates, it will initialize the app but never completes the cycle, meaning it's the Spotify logo followed by an endlessly hung-up blank/black screen. I wanted to like it but ultimately had to uninstall it."
"The pc version is great, with no difficulty, but on mobile, you need a premium to do ANYTHING. 6 skips per hour, random songs added to playlist only after you use the 6 skips, cant turn off shuffle, when you tap a song it previews it and does not play it, to play a song you need to play on shuffle, you cand rearrange songs, you cant turn off the suggestions, you cant see the next song. Those are just some of the problems and all of them are not problems on desktop."
"I hate how my mixes change between random shuffle and list where I can choose. It keeps changing to shuffle and a few hours later the same day it changes back, and other times it will change back in 2-3 days. It changes so frequent it is highly annoying. I also hate how the layout if the app keeps changing on the home screen pick something and stick with it. I really don't like podcast suggestions. It would also be great if the app worked offline."
Random is not random at all. I would love it if they were better integration to download music to your watch from the phone app. The app doesn't run very quickly on a watch and navigating is difficult. No option to choose skip ahead/back times for playlists. Catalog is good and I like how playlists are made.
"Horrible app! Constantly crashing while playing songs. Today alone, I haven't been able to make it through one entire song. Wouldn't even consider paying for premium if it can't even work in free mode. I asked some people at work, I know, and they have the same issues with premium. I'm going to check out some different apps."
"I have been driven by frustration to write this review. There are like 3 ads at any given time that they play and they are some of the most obnoxious ads ever. I don't mind ads and in no other medium am I driven to mute or skip through them like I am on spotify. This is especially true for music based ads, there is nothing more jarring than listening to my music then getting a musical ad that is completely opposite my genre of music!"
Up until 2 weeks ago I was able to use spotify mobile app. Now I can't log onto to the mobile app. I have uninstalled and re-installed repeatedly. And getting any help from Spotify is useless as well. I have a premium account. I'm paying 9.99 a month. At this point I am going to cancel my account and just be done with spotify. This last two weeks has been horrible horrible horrible
"Just a bad coincidence I guess. I lost premium then after 1 session of listening to podcasts I try to open the app the next day and it just doesn't open. I then tried updating, still wouldn't open. I guess not allowing it in background is all of a sudden a problem when I don't have premium. EDIT: Yes I did reinstall, and no I'm fine. My life is not drastically changed by not having this app."
I returned to this app after using desktop Spotify with ad-block (best way to use Spotify btw) but it's still the same as before. Listening to your playlist without shuffle is only for premium users which is SO ridiculously stupid. You can only listen to the short clips for songs if you try to click on one directly. And you can skip 6 songs for only one hour??? If I REALLY wanted to listen to music on my phone I'd use SoundCloud ð
"Web Player suddenly has no volume, which is more than inconvenient, as I listen to my playlists on my computer at work. And syncing with the app on my phone is a constant hiccup. Please fix it! I have 6 people on my premium plan that this affecting. Not worth paying for a service if it's not even going to work properly."
"frustrating - settings continually change at random. quality, volume, and most importantly where my songs download frequently change, resulting in poor quality of music, and worse an overload of internal memory, which happens weekly at random. I have to change and redownload my music to my sd card, only to have the app switch it back to my internal memory resulting in a crashing phone and a massive redownload, frequently. This also happens with the integration with Waze. PLEASE fix this."
"The new interface is completely unusable. Instead of showing me a variety of music I listen to it forces me to scroll through, one by one, a bunch of podcasts and ""suggestions."" It makes me think their plan is to force artists t pay to be at the top or whatever. Please bring back the old interface or at least let me choose to revert."
"Music will not play fully it plays the first 10 seconds then silence been having issues I've signed out and in multiple times I even restarted my phone uninstalled and installed the app again and it's still not working. As a person that's paying for premium service I'm not getting it, ya need to fix these bugs in your system, as of now I'm shutting down my account and saving my money on something that doesn't work. Looking for alternative streaming options that will be consistent everytime."
"The new layout is an annoying mess! Ever since the update, the music will just STOP in the middle of a song. Also, where's New Music Friday or New Music Radar??? I liked having new music and recently played music appear right when I opened the app. Now, not only do I need to dig to get to my playlists or previously played music, the homescreen is filled with OLD music and Taylor Swift. There's a glitch or some design that makes a random album cover (from 2015, mind you) appear multiple times."
"I usually love spotify, especially as someone living in the mountains. But holy hell this new update is awful. Offline does not work, Offline search doesn't work, if you try to select a music genre from my recently downloads I get the error ""You have filters set which may hide some results"" besides all the troubleshooting I've looked up. I'm disappointed as a regular spotify user"
"Im really tired of this. I've been using Spotify for a few years now. I think I need to find a different option. The ONLY reason Enter Sandman was my ""favorite"" song is cuz, even with premium, set to shuffle liked songs, they kept playing it. Over and over. My favorite song of all time is Sad but True. Same band. Same album. The ads when I can't afford premium are just too much. The ads are LOUDER than the music, so it wakes me up often. Do yourself a favor,..go with the new appit's cheaper ð"
"Roll back the update. It's garbage. When I open the app, I'd like to have the stuff I actually listen to front and center, not an accusation of being a theater kid despite having no interest in theater and the fact that I used to listen to one single musical soundtrack years ago. I'd rather listen to the songs I've been listening to lately, which the app used to be great about, but you've decided to screw that up for no reason other than to look busy."
"Can't add to queue while offline? Can't swipe to add to queue? Can't see which of your playlists a song is in? Seem like easy features to add. 05/01/23 New smart shuffle straight up broken. May be A/B testing but, beyond crazy change to existing shuffle button, for me it turns itself on and off, requires restarting your queue to remove suggestions even after it's turned off, and if you just want to use traditional shuffle or not you now have to cycle through the smart shuffle load (can be >1min)"
"This used to be an awesome app. And most likely my favorite to listen to. It had a vast collection of songs and it was easy to use. However, after a few weeks of using it, everything changed. I couldn't play my OWN playlist, Spotify would keep on adding songs to my playlist and I couldn't even listen to the songs I wanted to! This was basically useless at this point. I couldn't play any specific songs either. Please fix this."
"Sucks for Android. Things takes at least 2 minutes to load and sometimes my changes don't save. I hate that I pay 10$ a month for this experience but I'm already locked in and don't want to switch streaming providers right now. Also there are times where the app won't even open and it crashes. I have a Samsung s21, so a recent flagship and this should not be happening."
"The constant popups are extremely obnoxious. Please introduce a means to turn them off. STILL deleting my podcast AND music downloads, and I'm on premium. It happened this time after I rebooted my phone. Spotify responded here and asked if I have done a reinstall. That is terrible advice. Your product is broken and a reinstall means I have to re-download my podcasts and adjust all my settings again. Clearly Spotify doesn't care enough to fix this."
"Randomly won't play songs and nothing will remedy it. You can force quit the app as many times as you'd like, connect to whatever internet you want, and log out and log back in as much as possible, but it still won't play the song that I just listened to the first 10 seconds of. Something severely wrong with the coding of this app. I would like a refund for this month at the minimum."
"""You get Â½ hour of uninterrupted music"". LIES!!!! Instead, it's 3-5 ads between EVERY freaking song! ð¡ð¤¬ð¡ð¤¬ð¡ I do not navigate away from the page. I do not click on anything. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared caches, etc. 3-5 ads between EVERY song is ridiculous! This has been going on over 2 YEARS. ZERO stars. Time to quit Spotify."
Recent update makes it so I no longer can avoid VIDEO on an app I have for MUSIC. I used to be able to turn the video option OFF. Spotify can't even grasp the basic concept of RESPECTING their customers' choices! Also the app keeps trying to connect to speakers I don't own and can't make the app forget and Spotify's help center was useless to help.
"Podcast management is terrible. My playlist always shuffles with no way to turn it off, and when I contacted support they spent a while trying to figure out why it was happening. After delays and escalations, I was eventually told it was designed that way: playlists with podcasts automatically shuffle. Which is so stupid and counterintuitive"
"Awful programme. While the music choice is rather large, the audio quality is an appalling 320kbps -a far cry from what you would have when listening to a CD or vinyl record. The playlist model is disgusting, ruining the way that music should be listened to (in an album format). The ad selection is terrible, so if you're listening to extreme metal you get an ad with awful bubblegum pop in it. Not to mention that you can't even listen to songs in order without paying money."
"Riddled with ads. I don't mind listing to the occasional ad to support the app but I only get maybe 2 songs before sitting through multiple ads. The app used to offer hour long ad free offers if you watch a 30 second ad, but haven't seen that offer in months. Now you have to listen to 2-3 minutes of ads between 5 minutes of music. And $10 a month for premium is too steep. Moved over to Pandora because they have $5 a month option for ad free. ð¤·ââï¸"
Won't let you delete songs or podcasts you have listened to that you do not like and will keep suggesting them. Turns on randomly and no way to alter when and how it starts playing. Sometimes just pauses when interacting with Bluetooth device then can't restart. Sometimes I have to just reboot my phone. Overall glitchy and poor customization.
"Just remembered why I don't use Spotify. I reinstalled it to try it again. I opened the app, watched an ad, and it told me I had ad free listening for 30 minutes. Well, 4x 3 minute songs later, an ad popped up. No big deal, except it wasn't just 1 ad. 12 minutes into my ""30 minutes ad free listening"" I was fed 5 ads in a row. That is ridiculous, and I'll continue to pirate my music. Spotify is a scam."
"Edit: now I'm getting so many ""sponsored"" ads at start up and so many more ads when listening to podcast. I pay for premium to avoid ads Overall I like this app but it's been extremely slow to load lately for some reason. However that isn't my main issue with this app. I don't like that when I'm connected to a network, anyone on that network can join my session and vice versa, which I find extremely creepy. There isn't a way of can find to turn this off without going offline."
"Solid function as a streaming music service, however illogical UI decisions and the inability to turn ""features"" like videos in playlists off is aggravating and baffling. April 2023: The full screen tiles with audio and video that Spotify is pushing on users have made me look for alternatives. I recommend YouTube Music, included with YT Premium, the two together are well worth it over Spotify now."
"I want to like spotify but there are just somethings that annoy the hell out of me. Especially the free version, where if i search for a song and go to listen to it. It just starts playing a shuffle playlist of garbage songs. Also sometimes spotify will just add random songs to my playlist, like, WHO TF ASKED?!? Also it would be nice to be able to save things to a playlist how youtube does it, where you can select multiple playlists to add it to instead of one playlist at a time."
"Connects randomly to another device when playing, even when I'm at another location. App starts playing random music I've never looked up. Starts playing again after I've closed app. I've tried re-installing and continues to do the same thing. Music is easy to find and save to list. Getting music to download was difficult, and it only downloads to the app, doesn't make premium worth it for me. Rating is based on issues I've had with the app."
"What on earth is this latest UI update? Looks like it's been drawn by a 3 year old with a crayon. I know everybody complains about UI changes whatever they are, but I just want an app where music is simple to search (you know, like it was before this change), not some TikTok clone that autoplays crass tunes that are nothing like what I would usually listen to and requires ten years of scrolling to find something useful. The library is now crammed into a tiny sidebar. Poor, poor decisions."
"I paid for premium, downloaded music only to wake the next day will all of my downloads removed. (Update) This continues to happen. It switches to internal storage from SD card on it's own thus I have to reinstall music every other day. Also, my settings are changing on their own. Spotify seems very buggy. Uninstall & reinstalled, restarted phone w/o remedy."
"this app actually sucks, you can barely do anything without buying premium, its over rated to say the least. Other songs from diferent artists are added to albums of your favorite creators as well as songs from their other albums, completly unreliable starts playing 'recomended songs' after you've played all the songs when it should just restart the playlist, not even closing the app will fix it you have to restart your phone to replay the playlist. Only 6 skips per hour? Do better."
"I've paid for premium for years. However, the last few updates are not good at all. I can't even get through one song with the app running in the background. All permissions are set to allowed. Why am I paying for a service when I can't listen to one song all the way through?? Additionally, you're now switching from Playlist random music in ""suggested"" list. Ultimately, I'm not going to pay for Family premium when I can't get through one song. That has me frustrated to the max! Fix your app."
"The new update is devastating. It's now basically just ads, showing me content I'd would never listen to. I don't listen to podcasts and not once in my life have I listened to an audiobook, yet there they are taking space over the music and playlists I do listen to. It's a music app trying to be Instagram. Absolutely frustrating. I've been a premium member for years now and this might be the time to switch."
"There's some stupid video thing taking up space on my playlist now. Update: the app also starts playing songs while you scroll down through the homepage. Update 2: The entire app has a new design layout that I can only describe as ""Tiktok-like."" Which is probably great for some people, but it's not working for me, and I don't see any option to switch back."
"I have no idea what's wrong with this app, but it COMPLETELY drains my galaxy watch every time I use it. I barely made it through a 5k this morning. And yes, I checked app usage, Spotify was 42% usage, the next highest (my workout tracker) was 6%. Please figure out a fix for this! This is not the first device it has happened to as well. Also - absolutely hate the new 'smart shuffle' we should have the option to completely disable it instead of just turning it off."
"App fails more than it works. Will often skip ahead during podcasts randomly. Sometimes it won't play anything all together, other times it's super slow to load anything. Will NEVER auto update even if that option is selected. App will freeze while music/podcast is still playing, making it impossible to turn off unless it's forced stopped. For a multi billion dollar company, you'd think they'd be able to keep the App working correctly, but you'd be wrong."
This latest update is absolutely horrible. Like many people I am very dissapointed in the home screen layout. This new layout takes up the whole screen and takes forever to scroll through the list. I also do not like that it plays a music clip while I scroll. The previous version and display was 100% better as I could see more on the screen at one time to pick to listen to. I have a premium subscrip for about 3 years now and I really have liked spotify but this latest update is bad very bad
"Been with Spotify for years and the app has gotten better. But I don't understand why Spotify changed the way ""Your Library"" loads. It was perfect the way it was before.... Now I have to add a filter just to see my playlists. Extremely counterintuitive. (Update) once again, Spotify manages to make the UI even worse. The home page is completely unusable and counterintuitive. Can't believe I'm considering Apple music on my Android..."
"Massively disappointed in the new update. The new UI has completely ruined the app's user experience and browsing functionality on the home page. There isn't any way to turn off the previews, choose what type of content shows up in the previews. If a rollback or customization options to remove the preview feed isn't made available soon I'll be looking for a new music app after using Spotify for 10 years."
"I was trying to add a song in, and it wasn't working. so I restarted my phone a few times and it still wouldn't work. I disconnected and reconnected to my internet a few times, yet still nothing. strangely enough, all the songs in my recommended were glitchy too, so I tried adding a song and it wouldn't let me remove it after I added a song from my recommended. I tried force stopping, nothing. I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling, and all the songs in every single playlist got deleted. fix."
"I have no idea what could have changed, but the app won't stop auto playing when I connect to Bluetooth. I've disabled all the settings that are supposed to stop this, but it didn't work. At this point, I'm uninstalling. I'll use the web version until this is fixed. The issue happens on none of my other devices... not even my iPhone just my Android."
"The new app is a glorious mess. Since they added podcasts, it's basically impossible to find anything because music and podcasts and promoted content is all interspersed together. And the ads are unequivocally jarring. If your goal was to annoy the user into paying for premium, it would have succeeded if there was any value left in the app. But it's become hard to use and full of promoted content, I no longer feel the value of paying for this service. The soul of Spotify is gone."
"Stop trying to add new features that no one wants or needs and give us back landscape mode. You tried the car thing, no one wanted it and it was too expensive, now you don't even make it anymore, just give us back landscape mode otherwise I'm going to end up wrecking my car trying to navigate a whole playlist while driving instead of being able to simply swipe and not have to take my eyes off the road."
Love this app! I have premium and it's the best thing ever! April 2023: I've used this app for years and it's always been my favorite but recently all my past settings have been disabled. I'm reading reviews and obviously my Spotify hasn't been updated to the new thing. (Thank goodness) but I'm highly annoyed that my Spotify has now disabled the settings I set that I love the most. I loved it when I could go through my liked songs and pick the genre to look up in them. This is getting annoying
"The app is absolutely awful. The computer version is definitely better. It always fills playlists with songs I didn't even add and it's so annoying when I hear those songs instead of the songs I chose.. same with listening to just one song, there's also other songs that I hear instead of the one I chose. Also the skip limit is incredibly short if your going just fill Playlist with ""We Added"" ð¤¦ð¾ââï¸ just complete garbage. Why can't this be like the computer version?"
"The amount of advertising has exploded. This is a great app if you want to listen to two songs, followed by three ads. I am looking for another option, because Spotify has definitely declined recently. I am going back to iheart radio. I cannot believe how many ads I have to listen to - the radio is better than this!"
"Crashes often on home screen with all of the ""recommendations"" which are really ads. The only reason I use Spotify is to access a large library of the music I want to listen to but the home screen ruins it because it now only shows me stuff paid ads and podcasts I listened too once to try the feature once years ago. This also makes it a pain for using a service that I have paid hundreds into because it makes it difficult to jump through multiple menus just to get to the music I have curated."
"It seems like Spotify is desperate to make it harder to listen to my music by replacing everything on the home tab with irrelevant recommendations. Their attempt at being a ""discovery"" platform has made it a worse option for those that just want to stream music. To find my usual playlists I have to scroll past generic playlists and podcasts. (WHY is there no button that says ""no podcasts""?) At this point I'd almost be willing to pay for a tier that just let's me listen to music without the trash"
"This app was great for discovering new music until they updated the home screen. Now, it fills your whole screen with one album cover at a time and is practically unusable if you're trying to scroll to find something new or that fits your mood. I'm hoping they change it back soon. If they don't I may cancel my paid subscription."
"I have loved Spotify for years. Until recently, within the last few weeks they have re-designed the interface to be similar to tik tok. Its awful. I can't accurately locate anything on the home page now, it literally looks like Facebook reels/tik tok. Horrible choice, trying to find alternatives to this service now."
"Spotify is constantly changing the ui for the worse. Everytime I use the app, the buttons are in different places, or they are removing features like Playlist sorting. If you use the app while in the car, goodluck every changing anything because everytime you get into your car, the buttons are going to be in different places."
"Spotify was great. Honestly spotify is the only reason I still have a smart phone. I refuse to buy into the apple fad and get apple phones or music. The problem is, with every update something else goes wrong. Whether it is shutting me out of the app or no longer finding all of my artists. This time it was bad enough for a review. I have been a spotify premium user for a long time now. I can only access playlists, like they took away my premium even though I paid. I'm sick of it."
"Burns battery faster than watching youtube, and I pay for premium only for ads to glitch out podcast playback and mute it. The podcasts are especially egregious because the only way to fix it is to restart the podcast, WHICH PLAYS THE ADS AGAIN. So you're fiddling with the podcast, replaying it over and over, and hoping this time the ads won't break the audio. I've been using this app since 2016 and it's only become awful recently."
"Loved this app, even have premium but lately I'm really wondering why i even still have it. You removed the playlist to home screen option but the HUGE problem is your STUPID ""smart shuffle"". I have to uninstall the app once a month and reinstall because it keeps turning on the smart shuffle option and there's NO OTHER WAY to turn it off. I quick press, long press, medium press doesn't matter all it does is stay on and show a a pop up saying ""you've discovered a premium feature""!!! FIX YOUR APP"
"I'm a premium duo user. Used to really love spotify until the problem with not being able to go through all my genres kept happening. Just seem to disappear then reappear then disappear again. What is the deal? I'm not the only user to have this issue. No matter which device they own, all have this issue. Now if I choose the genres that are left over, there's no music showing up!! Meanwhile, I'm still paying full price for a service that only halfway works! Can I pay half price for half service?"
"When you click play on a song it plays a totally different song. Edit: IDK how to reply to the developer comment but it's not something going wrong with the app, it's literally playing a ""suggested song"" instead of the single song I clicked play on or scanned with a code. Like it's doing it on purpose to try to annoy me into paying for premium. Scummy af."
"Have been using Spotify for years and really enjoyed, but the last few rounds of major updates / overhauls to the system have really tanked its usability. This most recent one, that turned the landing page into an infinite scroll that starts playing clips and previews unprompted, is particularly bad. The library page has gotten increasingly bad, and now the landing page is unusable. Seriously considering canceling premium and listening to music another way."
"The app is a broken buggy mess. Good luck finding something to watch when everything looks like a gray rectangle. On the off chance you find something the video will play for a bit before buffering forever. I have to exit the video and start again in order to keep watching. Doesn't seem to matter if I'm using WiFi or mobile data, it still buffers. Offline downloads don't work at all. you wait hours for a single movie to finish downloading but when you start it it's just a black screen. Trash."
"I'm constantly ending up in an endless loop with the Disney+ app. It often logs out of devices and when I try to log back in, it asks for my email, sends me a code to my email for authentication, and then asks me to change my password. It never allows me to just go forward with the current password. The only option is to change passwords. I've changed my password almost a dozen times in the last 2 months. Terrible user experience."
"Would be five stars if I could actually use the app. I keep getting an error message on both of my phone's. I love playing for a service I can't use. It is now 2023 and this app has not gotten better at all. Everything i try to watch it freezes, I get the loading circle of death and the price went up. This is why use other means to view content. If I could give a half star I would."
"I've been watching Disney+ for a few months now when all of a sudden the app won't even let me in. Error code 73 disney+ only works in certain regions. So I tried the update, different phones, tablets, computers. Everyone has the same code. I'm in hawaii. It was working fine all this time. Not even lagging. I really don't want to stop my subscription but what's the point unless someone can help me fix this."
"This is getting ridiculous!!! Every time I try to restart a movie, so I can save it in my recently watched for my daughter, it just goes back to the middle/end of the movie again! I've had to delete her profile already and restart it, just to get movies to work. And now they've upped the price and added ads! This used to be the best streaming service, now it's becoming the worst!"
Very laggy and buffers every few seconds in whatever I'm watching. Not sure why Disney can't do better than this. I actually rented a movie on another app just because I don't have the patience to put up with the buffering on that same movie on this app. And now the app is telling me that it's not available in my region when I've never been outside the continental US. Very disappointing coming from what could possibly be the oldest animation company in the world. Please fix these issues Disney!
"For a week, maybe longer, we haven't been able to login to the app on our Samsung phones. We keep getting error code 83 on all our phones and I know it's not a compatibility issue because phones that previously were able to login, now cannot. Supposedly tech support is aware of it, but this is telling me a different story. I've NEVER had this long of an issue with ANY other streaming service. At most, I think 2 days. It's not connection either because the website works from the phones."
"After the last update, the rewind and fast forward functions on Smart TVs and streaming devices such Amazon Fire Stick no longer work properly. Both are now painfully slow, with no ability to speed it up (e.g. 2x, 3x, 4x); You used to be able to do this. Every other streaming app (Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max) does this, but not Disney Plus anymore. Horribly frustrating. It now takes 7-8 seconds to fast forward just one minute. Disney Rep says this is by design, not an issue? What a joke!"
"I love the app and the old, nostalgic movies on them. But for some reason, it's asking me to pay for subscription despite me having it for years?? I don't understand. This has never happened before. I don't have a problem with ads but it's not letting me skip the option to pay for a subscription?? Besides that, the sing alongs in the movie section are so irritating because that's all that will fill the screen. Disney has been tedious for a while now."
How is the buffering issue not fixed yet? It's been this way for months. A year ago it was perfect and now the app is pretty much useless. Can't get through 2 minutes of content without it buffering. Sometimes it won't even play at all. Massive L by Disney. Update: Still not fixed. Disney clearly doesn't care about this issue. Might as well rename the app to Buffer+
"This is the WORST APP! It does nothing but buffers! I can literally count the seconds between buffering without going over 20 to 25 seconds! Disney movies are my favorite and I have grandchildren! We've had it for years and why are we still paying for it every month is beyond me!! I've complained about it several times and nothing has changed! Yes I keep it updated because I check for updates EVERY DAY! But I guess when your worth that much money they don't care, nor do they have too guess! 0â"
"Very poor streaming app. Buffers frequently and causes my phone to heat up quite a bit and drains battery even while fast charging. Have to relaunch it multiple times just to see the home screen, usually it just sits there. After starting a video it always sits at a black screen for a while, then I'm able to press play to start the video. Billions of dollars go nowhere with Disney now, might as well dig up Walt and spit in his face, he'd be ashamed his name was associated with it."
"Does not work on galaxy tab s7fe. Initially downloaded and installed and seemed to work. Unfortunately, after attempting to download and/or watch anything if you pause or leave and come back will not load. Force stop does not work, tried all the settings attempting with wifi and cellular, same results. Also freezes up during attempted downloads. Will not even allow force stop. Uninstalled and reinstalled to the same results. It is completely unusable in its current state."
"Constant issues. Can't cast anymore. The cast symbol is gone. It doesn't show up until after you've started whatever you're watching on your phone. You gotta watch it on your phone for a bit, wait for the cast symbol to appear, then cast to your TV. I thought maybe it was just me but no I've tried 4 different phones, 6 different devices, and they all do the same thing."
"I am thoroughly disappointed with the Disney Plus app. The login process is incredibly buggy and it's a struggle to even sign in on my TV. The seamless experience that I was hoping for is simply not there. Furthermore, the rewind and video controls are subpar and leave much to be desired. The quality control is also lacking, making it unclear what type of video stream I am getting. I was hoping for 4K video, but instead I am left with a subpar experience. Disney needs to seriously step up their"
"Shows and movies take up to 8-13 hours to load on Android tablet and phones. Using browser to watch Disney is much faster - loads in seconds. This issue is present across all Samsung phones and tablets along with Google devices. Netflix, Amazon, etc. apps work without issue. This is a Disney app issue (cache, reinstall, etc. does not fix issue)."
"I really like all the new starwars shows, but unfortunately, the app does not work anymore. On my phone, I always get error 83 on my TV it always gives me error 91, and when I try to log in from the pc, it does nothing but Disney's connecting circle. It is absolutely ridiculous to have these issues. Netflix paramount+ and Amazon all work great, but after the last update, disney no longer works."
I've been having issues with it infinity loading. It works just fine on my old phone but on this device which is newer it just never loads and it freezes the phone all together. It worked perfectly two days ago and now it won't load. You would think Disney would make this app the best it can be to keep itself from bankruptcy.
"Update: Months later and still having the same problems. They don't respond to reviews and clearly aren't trying to fix the issues. The constant buffering is crazy! It pauses every few seconds, plays for maybe 15 seconds and then pauses again. Getting through a movie takes HOURS! This was once my favorite app to use but now it's an absolute joke. I should be able to watch what I want and not deal with the buffering every few seconds!"
"Personally, I love the Disney+ content. I'd love to give a better rating; however, it seems (like everyone else) it has real issues buffering on the app for Android systems. I have it on my Xbox series S and it works just fine. The issue is with the android app itself and it seems Disney could care less about fixing it. I'll probably keep my subscription just to watch it at home but it's useless on my phone. ***Disney, please fix your app for Android. Thanks.***"
"When I first downloaded the app a couple of years ago, it worked great. Now, just like everyone else, I'm having issues with buffering constantly. So many reviews are saying the same thing, yet someone at Disney is not paying attention and fixing it. The buffering problem has existed on this app for months and with every update, I am hopeful that someone fixed it. I get Disney+ free because of my cell phone plan. If I had to pay for it, I would cancel my subscription and delete the app!"
"I can't download anything on the app, and I have taken all the steps to try and fix it. I downloaded it specifically so I can download all the shows and watch them on the go. Update I have tried once again to repeat all the steps in solving error code 83 because it could be a human error on my end. I have come to the conclusion that after extensive research, that disney just needs to fix their app."
"Everytime I open the app, the homescreen tells me it's unable to load. This has been a problem for months. I've closed and reopened the app, deleted and reinstalled it, logged in and out, cleared the cache, and nothing I do resolves the issue. I have no problems accessing my account on other devices, so it's specifically a problem with the app. With the way it is now, it's literally unusable."
"Nice content, horrible app. Always freezing and failing to launch home screen. When you finally do, the video might also not play. Have no issue watching Amazon, Netflix, YouTube or Sling. So definitely an app not a network issue. Feb 22, 2023. Disney continues to be the worst streaming app available. Couldn't get it to play again (and again, and again...) Switched over to HBO app and enjoyed a couple shows. Could do the same with anything else without having to restart app a dozen times."
"Doesn't work on Android. I have a Moto Z4 and when I watch anything on the app, the video doesn't show. I can hear the audio, see the subtitles, and scrub through the progress bar to see the scene preview. But watching the content is not possible........... (Every time I launch this app and the problem isn't fixed, I add a period at the end of my review)"
"Glitches like crazy. On New Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra with full bars on 5G network or wifi full bars, still won't play movies without ""loading"" every 2 to 3 minutes. Takes about 6 hours to watch a 2 hour movie. Also extremely sensitive to touch. When you want to pause you end up accidentally fast forwarding all the way to the end of the movie or all the way to the beginning. Then it takes you about 15 minutes or more to get to where you were because of all the ""loading"". Edit: it has gotten worse"
"I can't add much to the recent reviews (the app doesn't work). Splash screen displays, loading wheel goes around ad infinitum. Eventually, an error message might pop-up ""Something went wrong"". Really? Did it really go wrong? Wow, I never would've guessed! I thought; for sure, Disney's well-compensated designers intended this exact response upon initialization of the app. I've an idea...hear me out....coding 101 states thorough testing required before rollout. Let's give that a try, shall we?"
"Constant buffering, multiple password resets. What happened? Over the past couple weeks, the app constantly buffers. Tried on my firestick & Galaxy s10e. Usually if one buffers, the other is fine. You literally can't watch at most a couple minutes. I've tried all the usual ""fixes"" (cleared cache/data, uninstalled/reinstalled, faster connection) nothing helps. Also, over the past week, I've had to reset my password 4 times. It literally won't remember it from one day to the next."
"I can't even watch anything. It pauses and loads every 20-30 seconds. I thought it may have been my connection but it doesn't do it with hulu, Netflix etc... so it's gotta be this app. I even gave it a a couple days without use and Uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times to see if it would work itself out but no such luck. Please fix this bug and I'll change my review."
"It's been super glitchy lately. Every time we try to watch a movie, it has to pause and load for a minute what feels like every 30 seconds to a couple minutes. It's been frustrating to the point we turn it off. If the glitch with the constant loading can get fixed I would quickly change it to 5 stars, but right now it's about impossible to watch a movie or show on the app"
"A 30% monthly rate hike and now the subtitles aren't just intermittent, they're gone completely. How many 1 start reviews does it take before you fix the problems with this app?! I don't know what you guys are doing over there, definitely not what needs to be done except for collecting payments, but it needs to be fixed or a lot of people are going to cancel. Also the screen freezes randomly now too."
"Price just keeps going up, and the app literally only works half the time. Can't even open the app on none of the Samsung tv's in my house. When we see something from the app, it has to be on my phone. The new price is kicking in on 1/5/23 that's pretty fast from the last price bump , and they can't fix any of the problems, but they want that money. So it looks like I have to part ways with Disney+ after being a very long-time customer it's just not worth the trouble."
"Pauses to load everything on it nearly every 30 seconds. Works well for about half an hour, then it turns worthless. I dont have this problem with any other streaming service or app on my phone. I'm at the point of canceling my subscription. New phone, plenty of space, no other apps taking up bandwidth."
"I noticed the app had stopped working on my samsung phone. It would open but i kept getting an ""oops something went wrong"" message when i tried to play anything. So i checked and there had been an update. I installed the update then the app wouldnt open at all. I just get a blue screen with the words Disney+ and a spinning circle at the bottom. I uninstalled and reinstalled. I rebooted my phone. Cleared cache on the app. Same result. Please correct this or I will have to drop my subscription."
"I can't watch anything on any device without the app buffering every 3-5 seconds. This is the worst streaming app, for the past 6 months I have only been able to watch approximately 10-15 hours of content without any issues. I'd have cancelled after the first month, but I'm only paying $1.99 with my Hulu bundle. Which streams fine 100% of the time! So does Netflix! I'll cancel before my next billing date if issues are not fixed."
"I don't know what's going on but in the past 3 months or so the player has been horrendous and unwatchable. There is no more continuous play, it keeps freezing up every 30-50 seconds during a movie and no amount of refreshing the app, deleting cache, reinstalling the whole app itself has helped. It is not an internet connectivity issue because I don't have this problem with any of my other movie media player apps like Netflix or Hulu, etc. Please fix it, it is utterly unviewable."
"It is so frustrating that I'm paying for an app that I'm not even able to watch on my phone. It keeps loading, and nothing happens. I tried updating it, clearing the cache, using my phone data, using my WiFi, and nothing works. Literally more than 10 minutes and nothing. And on my Xfinity box and my Firestick it takes forever to load. So much money this company makes and they are not able to figure out what is going on."
"First-time install and it never gets past the initial loading screen, just spins forever. Resets and reinstalls and data/cache clears make no difference. I've read a lot of people have solved their issues by disabling IPv6, but of course I can't do that on an Android phone. Buuuut it's not possible to get worse than permanently 100% broken right out of the box, so. No stars."
"App fails to download episodes over wifi or cellular networks. Gets to 2 or 3% and pops a message stating it has paused and will resume when connected again to wifi or cellular, but it was never disconnected. From there it stays stuck in a ""queued"" state. Also, after removing the failed episode download attempts, the app will come back with a ""cannot start"" error when trying download those same, failed, episodes again."
"I've had this app downloaded for about a year but in the last two months it hasn't opened once. It stays stuck on the opening loading screen and doesn't get past that. I've tried everything in the book to get it to work clearing cache, uninstalling, updating the app, updating my phone, restarting my phone and still nothing. You think for disney being a multi-billion dollar company and having EXTREMELY loyal costumers they would be a little more inclined on getting this fixed."
"Recently, this app has been having MAJOR issues on my SmartTV's. Plays fine for a bit, then buffers until an error message pops up. Doesn't save progress in Continue Watching, so you have to fast forward until you find where it quit working and hope it plays again. Until it quits AGAIN. It's total garbage, when you just want to watch a movie with the kids. If I could give 0 stars I would."
"The app is practically useless. It crashes randomly. And downloads will freeze. To the point that I have to brute force all the downloads to stop. Because the app will refuse to do it. It seems the app can only handle ONE download at a time. With the Netflix app I have ZERO PROBLEMS. Nothing like this whatsoever. I became a Disney Plus customer due to a promotion. But I will certainly not pay full price for such a bad product. Disney, you have the MONEY. Spend some of it fixing this app!"
"the app lags every time it needs to play an ad. somehow the app does not know how to load the ad when it needs to play during the ad breaks it sits and buffers until an error message pops up. this has been going on for about 2 months now and this issue really needs to be resolved for all Android TV Disney plus apps. this would be amazing if this issue is resolved as soon as possible, or we all are not going to be able to watch Disney Plus without inconvenience on Android TVs."
The app is essentially unwatchable on my phone. No matter what show I choose the lagginess makes it literally impossible to sit through thirty minutes of the frame struggling to catch up with the audio and will unsubscribe if unfixed. I have a Samsung phone and redownloading the app doesn't work and restarting the phone doesn't work so it doesn't make sense for me to pay for this service.
"For the past couple of months, it has been practically unusable. It has to buff every few seconds. The best so far was about 2 minutes of continuous before glitching. Nothing has changed on my end, and I never had these problems until a few months ago. And it's only with Disney Plus app. The app has become useless and worthless."
"I have been a user on multiple devices for a while now. On all my devices, it randomly loads the app and none of the troubleshooting ideas fixes it (ie closing and re-opening, clearing cache, uninstall and reinstall). Then when it does work, half way through a show or movie the sound will cut out. I know it's not my devices because they will play sound through Netflix and other apps. Disney needs to fix the problem with their app so that it is usable."
"It's disney so I mean expectations were low to begin with and yet they still managed to thoroughly impress me. This app leaves a LOT to be desired. It loads constantly while other apps have no problems. It consumes data like a fat guy in a pie eating contest. The brightness doesn't autoadjust so I go between not knowing what is going on to being blinded by the controls. It's just trash all the way around. It's taken me five hours to watch three episodes. Netflix, Prime, Hulu and YouTube load.ð¤·"
"App doesn't even open anymore. It just sits there on the first loading screen. I've tried clearing the cache/data, uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone and then re-installing, and nothing works. I'm on a Google pixel 6 pro. --- After the above review an app update was released. I installed it, and it's still broken. I've not encountered such a poor app like this in years. Very disappointing."
"Up u til recently I've had no issues with the app but for the last week, the app won't open for me. I click on the app and it just shows me the load screen for idk how long, then I get a message saying error code 9. But on my other devices, the app works fine. I haven't changed my password, I've been up to date with my payments. It's works on my families' phones, on our tvs, everything except my phone."
"I subscribed to the Hulu and Disney+ Black Friday bundle for $5/month and I'm ready to drop it already if they don't fix this app. As others have posted, it just sits and spins. Eventually, after maybe 20 minutes, it will finally display the main screen but then when I tap on something it does the same thing all over again. I'm going on a trip in a few days and was hoping to download some stuff to watch on the plane. That's a bust. Very disappointing from a company like Disney."
"App flat out sucks for the past month. A complete waste of money. The app will not even load so we haven't been able to use it at all. Updated, Uninstalled, restarted phone multiple times and over and over. Nothing has worked on multiple phones. Every other streaming service we have works normally. Disney+ doesn't work. They'll take our money all day but not provide a service that works. Real cool."
"Latest update still hasn't fixed playback issues. Neither streaming nor downloaded videos will play, the loading indicator just spins until error dialog pops up. Videos play fine with mobile Chrome browser in desktop mode, also other streaming services apps (Amazon Prime, HBO max, etc) work fine, so I know the problem is with the Disney+ app. Update 4/2: Latest update still has same issues. Disney should abandon this app and concentrate on making the website more mobile friendly."
"The mobile app on my tablet is extremely slow (takes 10+ minutes to load anything, even a search or an episode if I'm lucky, and won't even load my watch list), and when it does load it freezes and I have to restart the entire app. I have a Galaxy tab S7 and everything runs smoothly except for Disney+ unfortunately :/ The browser version on my laptop works fine, but it'd be nice if the app actually worked on my tablet."
"Unable to download videos for offline viewing. Disney+ is the worst when it comes to downloading videos for offline viewing, I can never trust it. Many times I try to open the app in airplane mode, and it has signed me out. Right now, I get error code 83 when trying to download videos. I can steam them just fine, but cannot download."
"This app barely ever works. It's always saying no internet, or cannot connect at this, please try again later. No matter what kind of device I try watching it on. It doesn't work well or even at all. The download feature would be awesome as well, if it actually worked when you had no service. That's the point of downloading a movie to a device. That still doesn't work well. They need to upgrade their system of some sort. It's a joke"
"I've been paying for this app for almost a year, maybe even over a year. In the last 3-4 months I have not been able to do anything with it. Can't watch anything. It keeps saying error code 42 but when I try to contact the developer out get help, I cannot. I can't seem to find a way to school get the help i need. Even tho this has been a public complaint about being charged for services I Was Not getting, not one single Disney rep has even attempted to fix the problem! Not OK disney!"
"When I first downloaded this app it was good, but it has fast become one of the worst streaming apps available. (Roku version works fine, just for the record) I have 5G and live in one of the largest metro areas in the country...yet if I try to watch a simple episode of the Simpsons on my lunch break it will freeze & buffer at LEAST 3 or 4 times in less than 30 min. Totally useless to the point of making trying to watch the shows (that I've paid for) unenjoyable. Is sad Disney can't do better."
"Worst app of major streamers! ""Login from device"" simply doesn't work if you don't have a very simple network. Accessing it is unreliable due to login issues with their servers. It recently started requiring profiles to enter their age and then password to do so - difficult when you use random 20+ character passwords. Streaming quality is unreliable, even when on a gigabit connection with good peering. Playing downloads offline is unreliable. The only good thing is that sorting is very logical."
Subtitles don't load correctly or are a few scenes behind. Whenever I am watching something a loading (buffering) circle spins in the middle of my screen with no loss of quality which I'm sure is a bug. Pretty bad chromecast support. And now they raise the price? How can you justify the price of this subscription with the least amount of content out of any of the streaming services? Looks like I'm putting my pirate hat back on. Yarr
"Use to love the app, but it doesn't even load for me. When it does load, it glitches and freezes. I'm never able to watch a movie through without freezing. I have disney plus on my phone and have tried to get my account to log in on my TV, but it won't work. It's like I have to start a whole another account. At this point, I have canceled my subscription ."
"Updated 2/15/23. Love the content, HATE THE APP. Its had issues sense the apps launch, and it has barely gotten better (phone or TV). I still get fully kicked out randomly when trying to watch something, and it randomly buffers and freezes. Every time I try to rewind a movie by a couple of sec, it lags for mult minutes. Maybe stop throwing all your money into making subpar live remakes(very unoriginal), and consider FIXING the services you already offer. The app still sucks, and its been YEARS."
update. Still an awful app. I want to love this app but can't. I can not for the life of me figure out how such a huge company like Disney can't figure out a streaming app. I love the amount of content. But the service is so unpredictable. 95% of the time when I select a show I have to watch a black screen for way too long before anything happens. Downloading is next to impossible most of the time. Today it took 15 mins for an 8 min episode of Bluey I had downloaded to play. Insane.
"my main issue was the constant buffering. I'm in a 5G area with full bars but still pauses to buffer every ten to fifteen seconds. I've tried different areas, different shows, and of course every suggestion I could find for troubleshooting. that was enough to make it unusable for me but I also expected more from a higher earning company like Disney. The app itself is very low budget compared to its competitors, and doesn't offer enough options for user control or customization."
"App hangs at starting splash screen. Doesn't work on any of my devices since Disney merged their login. And even when the app worked before that, such a terrible interface. In the extremely competitive world of streaming they should be incorporating features pretty standard with other apps (Netflix, Tubi) like watching at 1.5x speed, locking screen from accidental touches, or having the option to adjust the brightness on screen like Netflix and VLC have). For such a huge company a TERRIBLE app."
"I started getting glitches on every show/movie that I watch about a month ago. It just freezes the screen with a circle in the middle of the screen like it's trying to catch up to itsel every 2 mins or so, or when there is a fast scene(battle). It happens on all my devices. Disney+ has been my favorite streaming app since I started with them, but they really need to do something about it soon or I am going to cancel it. It's awful. I can't watch anything, why should I pay for it?"
"Very infuriating! I attempted to watch numerous shows and movies to test what works and what doesn't, and nothing but a black screen! It just shows audio subtitles and sounds but all blank screen while the show/movie runs in the background. You expect me to pay for this that refuses to work? Refund sounds better!"
Mobile app is awful. 90 percent of time spent loading. The 10 percent works fine. App crashes and message pops up blaming me or my wifi. But Netflix runs 95 percent of time perfectly on same wifi connection. Was able to download 10 Netflix shows/movies with plenty of room for Disney. But was only able to download 1 movie and 1 series. Would be fine with just Netflix but I have kids..... constantly fight with Disney app now 2 hrs of trying to download content. Took like 5 min with Netflix.
"Error code 83 most of the time, everything is up to date, and many restart. I've done everything I know to do and most of what I can find as well. It's been a long time since I've downloaded something so poorly developed, but it is the way of the world now. Turn out a poor product, charge premium fees, later release something that is supposedly new and improved, and charge even more."
"streaming service sucks. all shows and movies stop every few mins to load. This is the only service I have that does this. Hulu, Netflix, and Starz all work fine. Only Disney+ does this. can't watch anything do to it stopping to load so much. I have deleted and reinstalled but it's still doing it. Feeling a bit like a waste of money."
"It has good movies and shows but if you try to watch it on a laptop it won't work. For me what happened was that I was watching a movie and it paused by its self, kicked me out of the app, and shut down my Chromebook. I keep trying to watch the movie but it keeps kicking me out of the app for no reason. Disney needs to fix this because this happends almost every time I use Disney plus."
"Amazing... When it works... Literally between top end Android devices, brand new 4k tv, laptop, etc. This app works like 5% of the time. Either hangs at the Disney+ logo when launching or just black screens instead of launching the intended title. Using the download feature doesn't help and that actually made it worse. I don't get how a company like Disney has nearly unlimited access to cash, but can't make a worthwhile streaming service compared to others in the industry."
"Not a happy camper. I recently updated Hulu and Disney plus to save a few bucks. But so far not worth it. I have been unable to watch Disney plus through my mobile. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but still not working. All it does is Spin and say loading, doesn't do anything. Getting ready to cancel it all since I can't enjoy it. I'm paying money just to watch a loading screen. UPDATE. another month passed and still can't watch and you raised the rates. Hell no. Time to cancel."
"Its literally the only streaming app I've ever had that won't load, constantly buffers and keeps saying I'm offline. My kids can't watch any movie at all without it buffering every couple of minutes. Pointless to have it on my phone. I have the highest speed network. Brand new 2022 galaxy devices. Says no updates are available for the app."
"Just throwing this out there, but your app sucks on every platform. On PC, you try to click back on a video, and it literally just resets back to where it was. Really annoying glitch. On phone, your app occasionally crashes for, what I can tell, no reason. On consoles, your app is even worse! I could fill the entire comment with examples on consoles alone!"
"I had to warranty my old phone out and it was working then. Got new phone and downloaded app and now it is stuck at the loading screen. I can't even get past the spinning circle. I can watch it just fine on every other device. Then I got a hold of a customer service representative and with perfect signal, magically got disconnected after they found out I have done everything to possibly fix that issue, after waiting for nearly 20 minutes to talk to an agent."
"December 2022 update to app on our LG TV is terrible! Deleted watchlist for kids and no longer plays consecutive episodes of series like Bluey, now we have to manually start each episode. If there is a way to change this on settings it is in no way intuitive or easy to discern how to, or we would have changed the settings. Such a pain in the mouse-rears!"
"The Android app hasn't worked for months on any of our Android devices, giving an error code 83. I can log in on the website just fine. I've called support several times and keep getting told it's a known problem with the Android app and they're working on it. Not sure why it's taking several months to address this, but I'm about to cancel."
"Sloooooow. The app takes a couple minutes to load the title screen when I select a title from the home screen. Then to start playing it I press play and there is a black creek sitting there for another 4 minutes. Once the show starts it is okay, but It is a major battery drain. I have netflix, hulu, and prime video and none of those apps have this problem. I know it is not the internet connection too because even downloaded movies take 5 minutes to load."
"Bruhhhhhhhh, it's been doing this for a couple of days now, I get in the app, it's starts loading and then the load simply stops and doesn't load anymore, I have waited for it to continue loading for minutes and then the minutes have turned into a few hours, this hasn't happened before and I know that this is happening to other people as well, my neighbors Disney plus has this problem as well, this is terrible for a streaming service"
"I have signal, but even if I didnt, I should be able to get to my downloads without it forcing everything else to load. The whole point of downloads is so I can watch stuff without having to rely on wifi and signal. The entire app is rediculously slow. I'm paying good money to enjoy the content on the app, but the app itself is too glitched up. Very frustrating and its starting not to be worth my money at this point."
"The download feature is broken. I constantly get errors when trying to play content that I've downloaded, forcing me to wait until I can get to a place with a good signal to redownload them all over again. I find this happening usually after the app gets an update, so be sure to redownload everything after an update!"
Won't work since just before Thanksgiving. I can't open the app on my Android phone. It is a newer phone. Won't open on my fire TV stick. I have the newest version and an older version. Only one it works on is a smart TV that's older than my phone. This needs fixed asap and I think we all should be reimbursed for the weeks we didn't have access.
"As of late the app will not play any videos at all. My service is great because my other apps load fine. I click on a video screen goes black and never loads. I'll give it to the end of January and I'm cancelling. I'm not paying for a service I can't use. It's been two months now, and they expect people to pay a premium tier on top of that? RIDICULOUS"
For the past few months Disney has really disappointed me I can't watch anything at all without it reloading every minute it's very annoying and has made us not want to pay for it anymore now the price has went up I thought maybe it would be fixed due to that but no I was just trying it again and still same thing every minute you get the spinning wheel! Please fix the issue so we can enjoy the app again since price has went up this will definitely be our last month if something isn't done!
This app regularly glitches on my TV. Sound randomly goes out and doesn't want to come back. When selecting play the next episode the screen goes black and plays sound but not picture. I cannot go back to home screen after making a selection it locks up and stays there until I restart device. Can't even use the app half of the time. How is Disney such a conglomerate but can't offer a quality streaming platform?
"This app is pure garbage. Finding content is hard. Playing content is buggy. The app is EXTREMELY functionally limited. I use this app constantly and find myself falling back to other services because im tired of fighting with it. This app needs to be completely redone from the ground up. -Search options are weak -Results are unreliable and inconsistent -It's slow, freezes and fails to load content constantly (galaxy s21) -Basic options are broken or missing (auto-playback, playlists, and so on)"
"The group watch on mobile does this silly thing where it's impossible to pick what episode you actually want in a group watch, forcing you to start at the beginning of the season. Which wouldn't be too bad if you didnt have to manually skip through multiple episodes or seasons to get to the episode you want. When you finally get to the episode you want you better pray the link or app suddenly stops working or you'll have to start all over again! Left me and my partner incredibly frustrated."
"For a company as successful as Disney I would have expected a bit more from the UI. What really drives me nuts though is that when you tap the screen to hide the fine controls after using them, half the time your video stops and you end up back at the menu screen. It's infuriating and so unnecessary given that there's an arrow you can tap in the fine controls that would do the same thing, so why exactly is half the screen dedicated to that same purpose?"
"EDIT - now the app does not work with chromecast at all. No error code, just tries to launch and crashes. Spend ALMOST 2 HOURS with tech. Nothing. This app is the worst. Constantly hiccups and loses control of Chromecast. No problems with Netflix, BritBox, YouTube, amazon, but with Disney, trying to cast is a nightmare. Want to pause and rewind? Forget it! It's not worth the hassle! The content is great. Simpsons. X-files, what we do in the shadows? All great. But the app, it's the worst"
"This app is so unresponsive and glitchy, not to mention a UI disaster... There's plenty of good content to watch but Disney made sure it was all wrapped in the least user friendly experience possible, with buttons that take several taps to do anything, or that will sometimes never even work, a horrible selection and home screen menu that makes you scroll a bunch to resume watching something you were halfway through and that will sometimes get confused and recommend you rewatch episodes."
The app via chromecast is terrible. Maybe I am doing something wrong but when I want to continue watching a movie it does not continue where I stopped watching. Seeking is real pain. Only +-10s buttons and the slider which does not show current position. When I finish watching a movie and want to see the bonuses the movie page is almost impossible to get to.
"Good content, bad casting experience. Rewinding is a nightmare, it takes 10 seconds to go back 10 secs so you end up in the same place? So to go back 30 sec I pause, then hit -10 once, wait for it to load, it might stay paused in which case I hit -10 again, or it might start playing in which case I hit pause, and then -10 again, and so on. Or I could try my luck with the slider, but its so small you can't navigate to the right spot. Its just easier to watch via the app on my phone"
"The controls in the app are absolutely terrible!! When watching something & wanting to fast forward or rewind, you can't see the time stamp or image at all. It's awful! Especially for an app designed to be used with kids, you need the ability to skip parts easily and effectively. Please update this!!"
"Worst streaming app I've ever used. Connecting to Chromecast may or may not work. Group watch doesn't work anymore, app crashes instantly when changing episode. Lacks very basic functionality found in every other streaming app in existence. One of the most annoying things for me is the inability to access the episode list when watching an episode - switching episodes becomes extremely cumbersome, esp. if you start an episode from the home page, as you can't just go back to the show's own page."
"Terrible app. Definitely the worst streaming app of all I use. Repeatedly won't connect to chromecast. When it does eventually connect, the program won't then load. Never continues at the point you left off. & When you have to manually scroll to find the point you left off the toggle doesn't scroll, you just land at a random point in the timeline. Avoid at all costs if possible."
"Unfortunately, since installing it three years ago on its launch, the user-friendliness and features of this app have gone downhill. We typically use Chromecast with it and the app has several issues with the casting button to the point that it often requires repeated restarts to actually make it work. The app does not always keep the right starting point when continuing the watch of programs started previous times. Very often we need to restart the watch and search ourselves. Really bad."
"Worst streaming app I have ever tried. Loses what timestamps you are at constantly, crashes 3-4 times each time I watch, impossible to fast forward to desired time since you don't see the time and when you have moved the pointer it takes 20-30 seconds to load (internet is fine 10 MB/s). UI is not user friendly. Was expecting better from such a big company as Disney. Can believe they charge what they do for such a bad experice."
"There is so much wrong with this app I don't even know where to start. All around the user interface. Shows not re starting where you left them and sometimes going back to the start altogether. Moving forwards or backwards, no idea what time your skipping to, just a random guess. Issues chromecasting Things staying on your resume list when it's just credits left to play and no way to remove without watching the credits"
"Subtitles are huge with a bright blue background when casting from a Samsung phone to Chromecast and there is no way to change them. Sometimes the subtitle background flickeris between blue, black and semi-transparent. The subtitles look perfectly fine on any other device, including the phone that it is used for casting."
"The content on the platform is good, but the app itself is the worst of all the streaming apps! - make fast forward and backeard experience better. Both the +-10 seconds buttons and longer skips! Currently it is super slow and often causes the app to crash. Also you cant see how far ahead you are skipping. - make local experience more stable. The app crashes all the time. - make app more stable when used with chromecast. This goes for on device control and the job sent to the chromecast"
"After so many years of having access to one of the few descent streaming apps that didn't have adds, this recent development has been one huge step backward. It really is insane to me, the extra garbage we have to deal with makes it no better than other apps like it, and with that, there are just better options out there. I hope enough people reconsider paying to use netflix to the point where you reconsider the changes made and we can go back to the good times."
"Only thing good about this app is that I can watch shows I like...once I find them. The new UI is terrible. I have to go deep within the crevices of my profile to find ""continue watching"" and ""my list."" Wouldn't y'all think we'd prefer to see those options upon opening the app? Also, what's with the app controlling the screen brightness?? Basically, swap the locations of our lists/continue watching with the location of the new and upcoming and stop controlling the device brightness."
"The recent update (which sucks majorly anyway) has made it impossible for me to cast to my Chromecast. Despite spending hours troubleshooting, Netflix support was unhelpful, and the representative had difficulty understanding English or what a Chromecast is. They made me repeat the same troubleshooting steps, and now I cannot watch Netflix on my TV. I was eventually told it would be escalated and I would not be notified if it is resolved. I'll give it a few days before cancelining but âï¸"
"No sound when casting to chromecast. Only Netflix no other apps do this. Continue watching menu moves around too much. I'd like the ability to choose to keep it at the top. Resume watching often will restart an episode/movie from the beginning or resume an previous episode. Often, the red bar won't register that an episode has been watched. The app will loop back to episode 1 after finishing a series, causing it to not auto remove from the continue watching menu."
"They keep adding things that make the app worse for seemingly no reason. Why does the app need to have its own brightness controls? Incredibly annoying and there's no way to disable it. Speaking of annoying, there is never a time that I want the episodes to just start playing on their own. Period. Let me turn off these garbage UX changes. Other streaming services have much better and simpler apps."
"Now, the app won't let me use chromecast. I followed all the directions given to me by someone with the help center, and it still isn't working. All my other streaming apps will let me chromecast from my phone to the chromecast connected to my TV but not Netflix. That was the main way I watched/used Netflix, so now Netflix is kinda null for me. Would much rather want to use disney+ or hulu."
"New update is terrible. It doesn't even show you what shows you are CURRENTLY WATCHING. It ditched the old UI for a new YouTube style UI complete with a shorts tab. Please return the old UI, this one is terrible. Single shows take up the whole screen as opposed to before, when you could see multiple options on a side-scrolling row, separated by topics. Now, you get ""Everyone's watching"", ""Games"", ""top shows"" and ""top movies"". Please change it back, this makes me not want to browse new shows."
"Something is very wrong with this app. When you're browsing and swiping, it doesn't load. It's just black boxes. Happens all the time. Watching on the TV is great, though, with no issues. Netflix platform is top-notch! The app for the phone is what's really bad, though. It's pretty much useless. Also, movies that aren't shot in English should be in a separate category or something because with a few exceptions, I'm not interested in movies that aren't shot in English."
There is no Chromecast button. Every other app I have that can cast sees all 3 casting devices in my home. Netflix doesn't even have the cast button. Have tried 2 devices and there's no cast button on either one. Cancelling my service. I just googled it and I guess it's not available on an ad supported plan. There's no way I'm paying more money to do the most basic thing that free media apps offer. Ridiculous. I wish I had never signed up in the first place now that I know this. What a rip off!
"Hate that youre forced to watch movies and TV shows with the darkest lowest lighting and you can't change it unless you're using it on the ohone app and even then it doesn't work, the picture stays dark. And no, it's not my phone it's your stupid app. This doesn't happen on the web browser, just the apps. Just remove that feature, not everyone likes really dark scenes, especially when it's a show on the beach where it's supposed to be bright!"
"I love netflix but as of recently, it has been glitching like no other. To the point where you just either cant watch it or get too frustrated with it. I have heard this same thing happening to family and friends. It will let you start something then instantly stop 2 seconds in and go back to the home screen. I havent even been able to watch a full episode of anything in like a month, this is getting really ridiculous. This needs to be fixed or you will lose alot of people!"
I'm giving it one star for now. I've been loving Netflix until a few days ago that it stopped working. I can't control it using my Google TV Remote and when I try to stream it on my phone and cast it on the TV it won't connect. I've tried with other apps and they are working just fine. Did all the troubleshooting and I'm still stuck at the profile page
"Netflix is long overdue for a mini player. I listen on my phone at work and sometimes I need to do other things on my phone, but still would like to keep listening to what is playing. If this doesn't change, I'm getting rid of it, altogether. Hulu does this for it's customers, why can't netfilx!"
"New changes to this are not user-friendly. I liked being able to simply scroll through my saved list of shows. The new format is time-consuming and awkward. But what is most annoying is that I can not find shows that I have begun watching and wish to continue. I seldom have time to just sit and watch a full movie and show. This should be a very visible option, but apparently no longer. Very disappointed with the changes."
"The app on Chromecast has an issue with the Google TV remote app. In our household, the Google TV remotes that once controlled Netflix, have all now stopped working. One phone worked for a couple months longer than the other. No other app on the Chromecast has an issue with being controlled by the Google TV remote app. Google search results on the topic tell the whole story. This issue makes using Netflix on the Chromecast very annoying."
"Very disappointed in this app. I have a subscription and for what? Everytime I start watching a show it freezes on one scene but keeps playing the audio. I have to restart my phone just to get it to work and sometimes it says there was a error when I try to watch something. Last time I had a subscription I never had this problem. Edit: A few new problems have been happening sense I wrote this. The screen will turn back but the audio will keep playing, the screen flashes black over and over also"
"Chromecast is not working. I don't know what happened with the last update aside from the new annoying interface. The app no longer sees my Chromecast. Netflix is the only service giving me issues. Everything else i have (Disney+, Hulu, HBO max, YouTube TV, etc) works perfectly with my Chromecast. STOP BLAMING USERS AND FIX THE APP NETFLIX!!!"
"This is an on going thing, I have Netflix for about 2 months now and for some reason I keep getting a message ""we're having trouble playing this title right now try again later or select a different title"" so I tried a different title and the same thing keeps coming up. If I'm paying for a service I can't seem to get, maybe it's time to put my money someplace else. Note: did the restart, reset. And checked the internet speed. All good..."
"HDR is broken, at least on pixel 7 pro. Increasing brightness changes the color tone of the video and also reduces brightness ironically. Very weird experience. I can barely see anything on screen for slightly darker shows. This must be a setting we can turn off. A video quality we can choose - HDR on or off. What a horrible way to implement a video player."
"They went back to the old interface(added 2 â­). However, the 'next episode' pops up too early and cuts off the ending. In addition: they went back to the old interface, yet they still cut off the ending too early with 'next episode'. Minus 2 stars. Im paying for what? I will cancel at the end of March. Majority of internet designers have no understanding of bandwidth. ð¤£"
"What happened to ""picture-n-picture?? You used to be able to minimize whatever you were watching and respond to a text or an email while still watching your show and then you can go back to the larger screen if you want to. But you can't do that anymore even though it's Checked in my settings in my phone. This is an extreme disappointment because that was one of the many things I loved about the Netflix app. Fix it!!!"
Ever since the latest update I can't get to anything I was watching previously. Interface on the app is now extremely poor. Every year or two Netflix tries to push out an update that breaks the entire UI and everytime users complain about it. Haven't you got the point that the users still want our home page so we can quickly pick back up where we left off with a show?
"The newest update for the mobile app as of 4/13/2023 is awful. Absolutely prefer the original. I've been a netflix subscriber for years now and have loved it, but go back to OG version or give me a way to choose between the two, and I would rate higher Oh, AND it doesn't work with Chromecast anymore!? They're about to lose a long-time subscriber"
"Netflix is blocking me from using Smart View to cast to my TV, which is how I've always watched Netflix. Customer support did not seem interested in assisting me, telling me to just purchase a new TV. Literally every other streaming service I have works through Smartview, for whatever reason Netflix isn't allowing the image (other than the browsing menu) to be casted to the TV. The image is fine on my phone but is distorted or blank on my TV."
"Horrible update!! Copied YouTube layout! At the top of the screen, you can swipe to the side to find categories, I have no clue how to find ""continue watching"" the video preview is large exactly like YouTube app without scrolling down at all I can see just a little over 1 and a half shows/movies where as before without scrolling either direction I could see several, several movie suggestions. Please fix the app asap!!!"
"I've tried several times to log into the app (via my mother's [the account holder] permission, but it still says password incorrect, even after she tried to log me in on the app. I've tried disabling it, uninstalling it, getting the latest update, but nothing works. Please, for the love of all movie-goers our there, fix this issue. It shouldn't have to be an issue."
"Watch anywhere... Except if you travel, or want to sign in on another device. Worthless, I am completely restricted from watching anything during a long international flight and layover. The main reason I bought it. Also can't even login using the same user/pass from my other phone, saying the password is wrong when I just used it to login."
"If you have a new gen 5 Chromecast with Google TV you are out of luck. The newest version of Netflix, 8.61.0 was released March 14, 2023. As of then, this version of Chromecast is not supported. I spoke with 3 different Netflix people over the phone, it was brutal. ""Use a different streaming device"" is their only answer. They shut off all these devices from casting Netflix. What a trashy thing for them to do and say. I was loyal since the dvd days and now I'm gone."
"some of the worst UX i have seen. want to continue watching a show? good luck finding it without searching for it all over again, or navigating the episodes once you do find it. here's a bunch of random shows you might want to watch instead. want to pause or watch the credits instead of starting the next episode? too bad. auto-rotate is off? enjoy rotated screen anyway, with all of the Android controls hidden so you can barely escape the app. infuriating."
"Absolutely TERRIBLE update. I can't go to a different app on my phone and still watch my show, the home page is absolutely horrible to try and navigate, there's a couple of my shows that I click on and the words are coming out fine but it looks like I'm fast forwarding the picture in super slow motion. I don't have actual TV in my home so I rely on Netflix. Looks like I'll have to go to hulu and Disney + if it's not fixed. Seems I'm not the only one either. Please fix this Netflix!"
The app was perfect a few months ago or prior years. Now its harder to find content now that I don't see the cards and categories that movie horizontally. Now I just have to go one by one vertically by what Netflix recommends. Terrible update. And delete the scenes and games category. Absolutely useless. This isn't social media. And make a separate app for games.
The UI was charged into something completely unusable. I am not scrollin threw every single video on the platform ONE AT A TIME to find something. It's literally the worst experience I have ever had using an app. Contacted support. There was 'supposed to be' a way to opt out of the change - but they botched the update and the link doesn't exist under settings once you're UI has been changed to this monstrosity.
"1) the update to use giant cards for selections is terrible. It takes 30 seconds to scroll long enough to see what I used to see in one view. Terrible. 2) Netflix thinks I'm still watching something on my phone - several minutes after I've closed my app (preventing me from watching on another device). If you're not going to give me service, don't charge me for it. Terrible."
"By far the buggiest streaming app on a Google pixel 7 pro, the brightness controller does not work at all brightness stays the same no matter what, I have to clear storage to allow brightness to be controlled by the Android system again. The app also gets hung when minimizing the app then going back in and there is no way around it, I end up having to hard reset my device (hold power and volume down for 30 seconds). You're paying software engineers $500,000 a year. Do better."
"The last update is beyond frustrating! As someone who uses this app for a toddler tablet on long road trips, it WAS amazing. Last update now prevents shows from playing longer than 1.5hours! It is of absolutely no use to me when I have to stop and get out of the car to press the ""continue watching"" button every 1.5hrs instead of having shows play continuously for the 3 hours between stops. No option to stop it from asking either."
"""If it ain't broke... Don't fix it"". That should've been your motto when updating the app. I liked the older layout of the app because it presented Home screen movies and tv in a nice categorized order. Now I'm flooded with having to scroll down with individual trailer previews of mish-mashed media, forcing me to select a tab for either movies or tv just to navigate the app more easily. Yet another media app screwing things up for the sake of (trying to be) ""cutting edge""."
App no longer keeps your place when you exit the app it does it on my TV and my phone. Netflix used to have the best app now it's just junk. Please fix this issue it's very annoying having to scroll back and find your place every time you have to get out of the app for a second. It either restarts the episode or movie or goes on to a different one all together.
Horrendous new design and frequent crashes. I'm not sure who got hired to make this new ui design but it absolutely trash. You only see 1 title and have to keep scrolling down. I don't understand what was wrong with the old design that you had to switch up????? Well switch it back please. Netflix keeps crashing every time I open it up. Might as well just uninstall the entire app.
The new update is terrible. Now I can only see one movie or TV show at a time. You have to endlessly scroll through a list to find anything. It's absolutely terrible and anyone responsible at netflix for creating this abomination of a user interface should be fired. I literally cannot use netflix on my phone anymore. Thanks
"It never works! I really want to watch shows on Netflix, but IF the app opens it lags, freezes and buffers constantly while I'm trying to watch something. Watching a 30 minute show turns into a frustrating two hour ordeal with all of the interruptions. I don't have any trouble with any other streaming apps or channels. I'm canceling my membership."
Before it started crashing every time I try to open it.. the new layout is horrible. It's hard to find a variety of things to watch. And now I can't watch anything. The app crashes EVERY TIME I try to open it. I have had Netflix for YEARS.. and I've always loved it.. I'm paying for not and can't even watch ti now.
Keeps on getting more and more broken and features are either being removed on purpose or just not being fixed when they are breaking. Some broken features include saving your progress in tv shows and movies when you close the app and mini player on Android. On top of that it sometimes just doesn't load even when I have perfect internet connection or won't play movies and crash the app. This is not a problem on my end but on half of the app
New interface is terrible. No longer do you get to browse through lists left to right. Now you get one video trying to play in a window that won't allow you to see anything else. This is not user-friendly. Bring back lists and leave it alone. Stop moving our personal lists from the top. Some things don't need changing.
"I haven't been able to use Netflix in weeks. I don't like talking to tech support so it took me a while to contact them. I started the conversation with ""I've already gone through your whole troubleshooting"" and their answer was to send me a link to the troubleshooting. And they can't issue a refund because ""the service has already been used."". The whole reason I was talking to them was because the service COULDNT BE USED. bunch of incompetent clown shoes. It's only $10 but it's the principle"
Guess it's time to cancel my subscription. You can't just blackmail users into paying extra for something. There's barely even any new shows worth watching to begin with since everything that starts airing gets canned no matter how successful. It's kinda hard to commit to something if you're paranoid it's just gonna get trashed before completion.
"After recent update, absolutely terrible. They have a few good original shows and movies but not enough for what they seem to be charging. Plus the charge for how many devices can be used at once. To top it off more, now you are REQUIRED to watch at least one thing within 31 days on you device to prevent it from blocking you in your own home. So like I said they don't have much good stuff to watch but you have to watch something to not get blocked out of your own account."
"The new layout is awful, it would be great if we were allowed to choose which one we could use. The current one gives me a headache and is annoying to browse. I liked the older one where its broke down into categories and only had the cover instead of everything in a single column that auto starts a preview."
Netflix has gone down the shi++er!! On both my phone and the TV it takes a disgustingly LONG time just to scroll through the movies/TV shows and not only that but it crashes multiple times everytime I try to use it! Seriously thinking about canceling my subscription if something isn't done! I would Seriously give it zero stars if it were an option
The recent update that has changed the mobile interface is unfortunate. It's frustrating to navigate. In order to continue watching a series I have to scroll through a list of recommendations. It would be more convenient to have the series and movies I can continue watching toward the top of the page and make the of the page rest recommendations
The new version is horrible! I absolutely hate the large icons for each show or movie and having to scroll through the top 10 before I get to other things. It is nearly impossible to just glance at available choices because of the large icons and the new vertical format. Very bad design.
Why Netflix???????? I used to praise your UX but this recent update has me close to stopping my subscription. I am not one to write reviews so please use this as a plea to change it back to horizontal scrolling. Whomever thought this was a good idea should be fired. The discovery is awful and I am no longer enjoying my experience in app. All i ask is go back to the previous layout and to stop showing titles I have already watched. I will give yall one more month then I'm moving on.
Change back to the old layout. I don't get how you guys expect more movies to be watched when its the constant same thing on your feed instead of being able to slide and search for something you want. You guys are gonna lose money by doing this... with as much new films that come out and now not being promoted as much Netflix is gonna go down hill.
"Since the new update my app won't work. I uninstalled it and installed again but still won't work. It's just a black screen with red Netflix logo, and it won't load past that. Went on line to watch online, but can't do that either on my phone because it just tells you to download the app. Well the app is not working. Going to cancel, won't pay for something I can't use. Too bad, my kids liked it a lot."
"Terrible. Cant watch anything because nothing will load. Wifi connection is fine, other apps work just fine. But cant get Netflix to open, or load, or brouse, just fails. Customer service is worse. Their only option is either unplug my tv, which EVERY OTHER APP WORKS JUST FINE, or wait a few minutes and try again. Why would anyone pay for this quality of service."
"It's impossible to leave feedback for Netflix anywhere else, so maybe they'll see it here. They obviously don't care about their customers' opinions anyway, so this probably has no point...when you click on title to read the synopsis, it autoplays, fading the entire UI into nothingness. This is separate from ""autoplay trailers and next episodes"". This is HORRIBLY OBTRUSIVE. I only want something to play when I CLICK PLAY, not because Netflix wants to shove whatever it can in front of my face."
"The new interface is garbage, I don't need to see giant sections of my phones screen taken up by ""trending"" movies/TV shows. I would like to scroll down and find my ""continue watching"" list, but instead it's an endless amount of thi gs from the ""trending"" list. Previous version was much more user friendly."
"It's wild how this app can go from running smoothly the majority of the time I've had it downloaded, to not even being able to open the app fully because of vague connectivity issues. I can't even display titles or access downloaded content. Just nothing. I've never had problems this severe while using Netflix, but it seems I won't be using it anymore. Shame, Troll looked really cool."
"This app is becoming incresibly obnoxious to use. I have to scroll through their spotlight, top 10, and popular on Netflix sections (what even is the difference between them anyways?) Of shoes that I could not care less about just to get to my recently played. Plus all of the playback issues and how it disconnects after every episode when I cast from my device."
"Terrible, thoughtless update - do you have any idea how your subscribers actually use your phone app? I'm no longer able to casually browse for a film to watch, something I hadn't thought too much about previously, without scrolling endlessly while the streaming push marketing for EACH film on my screen distracts from the process completely. Go back to the previous format! And BTW, where did you hide the Continue Watching menu? Ingenious!!"
New mobile update sucks. Ridiculously hard to find anything and takes forever. Single show in skrool instead of side scroll is horrible it's so frustrating I will stop using Netflix because it's to hard to find anything anyway. It was fine before revert or lose customers. Only update you need is more content stop fixing things that are not broken. I can't even find my saved without pushing a bunch of menu options Bs
"Since the password restrictions have been put into place, we have had constant trouble accessing Netflix. I keep getting the error message that too many people are signed in. I sign everyone out. I still get the message. I reset the password, still get the message. I would like to be able to turn it on and have it work properly."
"New updated version is suck. Whenever I open a movie, the control UI is corrupted, it seems like the UI was shifted to the left but I only able to tap on the area next to it for the function to work. The movie screen is also shifted the left. It's is not even in fullscreen mode. For context, I'm watching video on Youtube, Facebook, other streaming services without experiencing any similar issue."
Trying to keep people from sharing their password and have multiple viewers on a single account Netflix is shooting themselves in the foot. As I for one travel a lot and the app is going nuts and trying to send me a text on my phone number but with the wrong country code. Issue 1 Issue no 2: their library is poor ð© ! Bar a few shows and films they lack a lot! Have a nice fading out Netflix.
"Netflix's Chromecast support has always been something to laugh at, not sure how difficult it might be to implement the feature right, but I think it SHOULD NOT be this painful... Anyhow, it is what it is. All my other streaming services, and Google Home, are casting perfectly to my device, but netflix isn't. I already tried everything in Netflix's troubleshooting page (reboot device, reboot chromecast, etc.), I guess I'll just way until another day when it finally decides to work again."
"The latest update is one of the worst I've ever seen in any app. I honestly have no idea what's the mindset behind that design decision, but obviously, the team that designed and approved that decision possibly don't even watch Netflix. Another issue is that the cast feature is possibly broken as the cast icon does not appear unless I play a YouTube video, disconnect and then open Netflix. It's been 4 days since it started... Coincides with the update."
"Whenever watching a native English speaking movie or show and there is a scene in a foreign language, Netflix does not display the subtitles. It makes it impossible to follow quite often leaving the only option to simply switch off. So many people have been complaining about this issue for over 9 years and it still remains. PATHETIC"
"Slow descent into mediocrity. I've had Netflix for 9 years and it used to be more than worth the cost. We only ever used two screens so, since Netflix encouraged it, we shared our account with family. But with the ever increasing cost, ever dwindling of content worth watching, and new crackdown on passwords, this has become a service more expensive than it is worth. My last day of subscription is in 2 days and I am not coming back without major improvements to the service."
"Team, If you are doing any enhancements in app please do a thorough testing. I can't seem to play any videos on my mobile, however I am able to see it in my TV. No titles are playing, not even the downloaded one's. I was travelling so I downloaded few of the movies which I thought will be good time to watch on flight. But none of the video's were loading. I was so disappointed. If this issue keeps on getting frequently, then I guess I will have to switch to better options."
"Edit: now I can't even change it back from L3 anymore with any of the troubleshooting tips. Avoid the mobile app like the plague! Original: The app keeps changing the Widevine from L1 to L3, which means I'm only able to play in SD quality without HDR. The only fix for this is to reinstall it. And this happens frequently... It's extremely frustrating to say the least."
"Latest update is absolutely horrendous. Used to be great, single click open and continue watching was the first thing I saw. Then easily scroll horizontal and vertical to new shows/movies. Now the home page is one tile wide, and only horizontal scrolling. Continue watching and my watchlist are on a completely separate page, under the search function for some reason?? Definitely a step backwards in user friendly-ness."
"Why can't Netflix provide an easy option to change/upgrade your plan? It's so annoying and disappointing that you just assume I would always and forever use the same plan I started with, I contacted a Netflix personnel, nothing changed, it wasn't even helpful at all. Asides this and the fact that there are many incomplete but interesting series, I think it's okay."
"Password sharing crackdown was the last straw. But between the astronomically increased prices, adding in features that no one asked for (e.g games), completely blowing the creation of movies and shows that should have been 100% successes, cancelling the few good shows that they did make. Netflix is fighting to stay relevant in an industry that is offering way better content than them and charging more than other applications to do it."
"Was fine until the last year they started trying to charge me for time between monthly subscriptions by calling it a ""grace period"" (which it really isn't because I did not have access to Netflix during this time) and subtracting the time from my next month's subscription. If I went a week without a sub they would renew the month after the next a week early. Um no, you're not charging me for not using Netflix for a week or 2. That's theft not a grace period. Will no longer be using Netflix."
"Update: Netflix is the third class streaming option out there. I mean it's so damn slow and interface is so bad. I can't believe they are selling this at the most premium price of any streaming platform in India. Primevideo and hotstar are so much better than it. It just doesn't boot up. If it does, it shows images in some and none in others. It buffers. I mean seriously? Buffering in 2022? All my other apps don't buffer even once even though they are on HD and this on 480p buffers."
"Every time I try to ""resume"" anything it either takes me to a completely different episode, season and sometimes even a completely different series! Then when I try to use the in app back out button of the wrong show it force closes the app. I have crave, prime, crunchy roll, funamation, and Disney and none of them even remotely come close to having as buggy of an app as Netflix. My phone is updated, the app is updated, I've Uninstalled and reinstalled. Makes me not want to use the app anymore"
"I cannot seem to play any of the downloaded videos. The Netflix help center faq suggests it's because of an incompatible Android device or a change in device, but I've been on the same phone since the last 1 year. And to top it off, this happened just before a 15 hour flight for me. Well done Netflix, atleast do some thorough testing when you do something"
"On cell phone works okay, on smart TV works okay, most recent update for tablet is horrible. Taking my already small screen and making it smaller. For my tablet I am wishing I never made the update. When you click on something, instead of getting that nice big screen image on one side with episodes on the other was perfect. Now I can barely read it, with the episodes jammed under a preview screen you, everything is so jumbled, makes a guy want to turn back to Prime Video!!!"
"This app is trash. Netflix deliberately prevents screen mirroring, because they want to charge you extra for something you otherwise could already do, because physics. But even if you are a paying customer and not on an ad supported plan like a peasant, casting doesn't work, either, and the app won't tell you why. They just hide the button. You don't even know it is a feature you could pay for if you didn't already, so Netflix sucks at marketing, too."
"Was great in the start, but something is not working for about 3 months now... I have been using the mobile app for downloading to my phone for the morning and evening commutes or if I'm in the kitchen and I just prop my phone up while I work. It started off perfect, little to no issues, if any, but about 3 months ago I have been unable to watch anything at all... I can only watch on the TV or my laptop, but the app doesn't play anything except the trailers. It only loads until timeout..."
"In general - it's an ok app. But missing Cast icon is just killing me. I don't want to login to my Netflix account on every TV. I travel pretty often but I want to watch my Netflix on the TV wherever I stay... The cast icon should be there (with my premium account) but it is not... So I can cast my phone screen via Google home app (but then I can't use my phone for anything else while watching Netflix), but I can NOT do it natively in the Netflix app. Unreasonable and irrational."
I have experienced not so good on this app. I have noticed a trend. I have noticed that most moves are like are taken away and They go to Free movie apps but they have commercial. Interruption. I don't like that. I'd like to see my movies. My favorite movies Without commercial interruption But it is now impossible because. My favorite movie's past And present my favorite movies seem to be moving to free apps and that's. Fair because I pay for Netflix
"Finally gave up on Netflix after their latest changes to subscriptions. Used to love them when they were the OG streaming service but now they are lackluster. When the prices keep increasing and more rules for how I use the service, I realized it's time to give it up. After cancelling the subscription, I went to delete the app only to realize that you cannot delete Netflix fully from android phones. Great."
"It's not the app but the Netflix itself. I've tried to hide the title under viewing history, but it's totally not work at all. As it saying title will be hidden after 24 hours, and recommendations will not be based on that title anymore. However, in my case the wanted deleted titles keep appearing after tons of deleted attempts. Its such an annoyance and frustration. Please look into this."
1. This app continually gives me problems I couldn't get help from netflix support it has a blank screen on every show I have to guess what's what bad experience all round 2. my downloads don't finish downloading and I have a great network connection so it's really just annoying and a waste if my time and money really Uninstalling and getting worse effects every time. restarting the phone nothing works . so sick and tired!!
"The app was working find but from a couple of months, the videos on the app are extremely saturated to the point that I cannot see the faces of the actors. This is only happening on the mobile app. I have ypdated, changed settings on my phone but it is only the netflix app that ahows videos in this extremely saturated manner. Other video players on my phone are fine I wish there was a solution."
Netflix used to be good. Now the smart tv app is clunky and difficult to navigate. Autoplay while in preview is a pain. Exiting the app requires too many clicks. As far as the content goes there are far too many series that are cancelled after one or two seasons.
"Honestly everytime it just closes on me, it's still open but is constantly closing. It was fine when I first installed it but now. It's just being incredibly annoying and I can't even watch what I want, and even if it does work and I get to the show I want to watch it just shutdowns and says nothing about the problem. 1 star terrible app, fix this please."
"It's so frustrating how hard it is to watch something in this mobile app. There is always an error 5.10 or 5.8 and the only solution seems to be restarting my phone everytime there is an issue. And the few times the video actually plays, random glitches pop up, like an overcontrasted pixelated image, or green blocks or sometime the video simply freezes while the audio continues."
"After the recent update, I am no longer able to download anything. I received a message saying I have too many devices used for downloading. I do not. I did not change anything. All I did was update the app. Customer service says I need to delete my device from my account and re-add it again. And re-download everything all over again. What a hassle. Netflix prices go up and quality of service goes down. Typical"
"This app has so many bugs with the new update of android 13. For now i can t use netflix as a small window( black screen, only audio) . After windowing it, so i can multitask, i try to click the fullscrenn option and the app just closes. When i get at the end of an episode while small windowing it, i get sent back 2 episodes. I subscribed to netflix and youtube premium for the small window mode and i dont have it. I can t enjoy it . Very dissapointed. It fells like beeing robbed"
"Netflix likes to put out one season of a show that's awesome, then cancel it because it doesn't meet some random metric that they won't explain. A thousand garbage movies and shows and the good things they actually manage to produce get canned. The only thing Netflix is good for is wasting time trying to find something to watch, then realizing you need to go to another platform because they cancel the stuff that's actually interesting."
"The new interface update on the Android app is awful. Now it reads like a social media app, and automatically plays trailers (I can't turn this off!) Bring back the cohesive, readable lists it used to have. There is no continue watching section and My List had no particular organisation. This app is now an assault on the senses, it is no longer user friendly nor accessible. I weep for my neurodivergent fellows. Please change it back ASAP."
"I don't know if it's because of the latest update but once I play something on Netflix it does not cover my entire phone screen like it used to, there's a big black bar on one side of the screen and it is annoying to watch movies or series this way. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, even restarted my phone but nothing seems to work..."
"The UI is god awful now. Why can't I instantly see ""My List"" anymore or basic movie categories. Now I have to scroll through random movie recommendations that only pertain to what's popular on Netflix, not what the user is interested in. It shouldn't be too difficult like this to navigate the app and if you're going to make it this way, at least make the UI somewhat customized. So DUMB."
App update puts you on explore page. That's a terrible UI. Please revert or give me the option to not be annoyed by your spam. Canceling is easier than you think. Lots of other options. How do I give this 0? You now have the app make an annoying noise when I open. My phone is on silent for a reason. Stop.
"In one year, the price raised **twice**, It's now more than double the cost of what it was when I first got it! From $10 to $25/month within a couple years is crazy price gouging!! Most of its old videos and not really worth it. Amazon and Disney still cost less together than one Netflix sub. Update: canceled due to the new password sharing, mom can't watch at her house, then I'll just share my other apps. Bye bye netflix! Enjoy your downfall!"
The experience is very bad. I am a new customer and wanted to enjoy Netflix shows but the app is shutting itself down in 5 seconds and I have already paid the amount and this is very irritating. Please do something about this bug soon and update this app. I don't want my money to get wasted so please help me regarding this issue. I am waiting for your reply (on email if possible).
"You need to seriously listen to your users. Simply terrible. Constantly crashing my s22 ultra and forces restart (3 times in one day). Kicks me out and forces me to re-sign in, then tells me my information is incorrect. App crashes half the time when using PiP. I've had nothing but problems with Netflix this year. How has Hulu overtaken you in performance, usability and selection?? What a joke."
"If Bluetooth is use, then Netflix plays at max HD instead of 4K. As soon as I turn off the Bluetooth it plays 4K again. The issue does not exist with competitors. Update: We have a lot of technical problems the last months. We need to restart the TV or force stop to make it work."
"What's wrong with you guys. The new app interface sucks. Why does the home screen show my list, instead of giving me a choice of things to watch. Please get the old settings back if you want to retain customers. Ot so frustrating now to search programs to watch."
"Horrible TV APP! The app works fine on my phone with no problems. However, when I've installed it, my Samsung T v's or a Toshiba TV it freezes up. It also will not play titles. I have installed and uninstalled, logged in and logged out and it's horrible. I can be in the middle of watching something and the app will kick me out completely. I am really regretting my monthly membership. I'm seriously considering canceling it completely. Hulu needs to fire their IT team and start over with new ones."
"UX is astonishingly bad. Most streaming services feel more or less the same. Hulu, for some reason, has decided to be entirely different. Amazon, Netflix, HBO, and others all more or less agree that users like the same basic ways to interact with the apps. Hulu decided to go rogue, and it's terrible. It's not intuitive, it feels deliberately clunky, and there's nothing to be done about it except cancel my account."
"Hulu has always had sub-par user interface, but they apparently also limit your screen size. I regularly use my phone and tablets for watching videos and movies. Hulu has the worst aspect ratio of any mobile streaming service app, and they do not have an option to zoom or make it full screen. One would think in 2023 that they would have figured out how to make a halfway decent app. The bad design of this app is enough for me to cancel my subscription."
"Recently, the app on my Firestick freezes, buffers, and lags, making watching an episode of a show a frustratingly long experience. I've been a subscriber for years, and this time, I paid for an annual plan. Big mistake. I've done everything I can on my end--clearing the cache, deleting and reinstalling. And it's not my internet as every other app works fine. Hulu, fix this, or you will be losing customers."
"I like it, but fix the ad problem, I don't like how when I rewind a few minutes back after it's left the ads, I have to watch the ads again, you are already charging for the ads, so don't make people have to see the ads again, I'll change it to a five star when I notice it's been fixed. Update: found a new issue that caused me to change it to a 3 star, it has an issue where it tries to go to the next episode before finishing the previous one."
"The UI is terrible, you can't see a list of episodes for any shows. The auto play doesnt stop at any point. The app randomly crashes when using with chromecast. The what's next playlist shows you random shows that aren't relevent. The shows that have subbed/dubbed versions are separate VIDEOS from each other (why not just make it a separate option in the player?) For the ad tier, theres at least 10 minutes of ads per episode."
"Constant playback errors whether on cell data or wifi. I have this on the Pixel 2 XL with the latest OS as of November 2019. Hopefully it gets fixed because I was not having these issues 6 months ago. Really disappointed. Update: well the app sucks just as much in 2023 as it did in 2019 when I wrote this review. Also, what's the point of downloading content if when I open the app, it takes forever to load because it's checking for Internet. Pointless, useless, and downright waste of time."
"Terrible app. It's free for me with Spotify, and I still consider dropping it due to it's terrible performance. There are to many ads that are annoyingly repetitive and there are platform issues like playing something and forcing an ad on me but just opening the app or skipping forward as I'm watching something so I have to constantly go back. Plus I've gotten double ad breaks where it seems like it's going to go back to the show and then does another full ad break."
"So much room for improvement. Watching a live tv program from behind is glitchy. Just throws you to live. Which is pretty awful as a sports fan. Several games have been ruined. Recordings have no management, and deleted recordings come back. It does do a good job of highlighting the best live option from jump. Update: Going down to one star as ""Hulu has (continued to ruin not quite) live sports."" I'd rather it default to the beginning of a live sporting event when it loses its place."
"Works fine as long as I never pause. Movies often restart to the beginning. TV shows usually skip to the next episode even if I have an hour left in the current episode. So frustrating and it doesn't just happen on the mobile app but also the smart dvd, the firestick, etc. Recently there's been an added pausing glitch where pressing play resumes the audio but screen remains frozen on the paused screen."
"I pay full price. When I watch Hulu on my Roku, I sometimes leave it playing while I fall asleep. When I go back to watch earlier episodes, it plays the last couple minutes, skips to the next episode, and does it again. It's not that hard to program a smarter program. If you don't finish, save my spot. If I did finish, but I go back to watch, start over again... Why would it play the very end of every episode?"
"I can't watch nothing without it buffering. Not on my TV at home or on my phone when I'm at work on the other side of town. I've called, talked to support and all they do is walk me through the troubleshooting. After we go through all that it'll work for 30mins(maybe) and start buffering again. As soon as I find a better streaming service with local channels, I'm cutting the cord with Hulu! Your days are numbered Hulu!"
"Couldn't be a worse streaming service if it tried. Hulu will always load ads at 1080p instantaneously, but the movie you're watching will fluctuate wildly between 720p and (not kidding) 240p, even on a high speed/high bandwidth internet connection. Want to rewind a few seconds because you couldn't see what was happening on screen due to low resolution? Have an ad ð it wasn't there before, but it is now. Want to lock the quality at 720 and wait for it to load? Not an option. I hate Hulu."
"The ads are complete garbage, and the app itself isn't worth paying the extra for ""no ads"", when you still get ads when you first start what you're watching. If it wasn't for Disney plus, I would drop hulu in an instant. I don't mind ads at all, but when they are absolute garbage, it makes me lose interest in using the app. I turn off hulu constantly bc of the garbage ads and look to youtube to watch what I want to watch. And the things you dislike are constantly suggested to you.. it's annoying"
"Would STILL give a NEGATIVE stars if possible. NONE of the other streaming apps I have & I use on ALL the same devices have freezing or buffering issues NONE! I have un/reinstalled, cache, memory, temp file cleanex etc. etc. ALL of the ""TRY THESE"" to fix HULU's PROBLEMS doesn't work! Odd the commercials don't buffer nearly as much!ð¤ It sucks since it seems they keep ignoring the issues & don't care cause they dont have to if they're the only app that has the show or movie. Again ONLY HULU APP!"
Ads are way too long and way too often. As soon as I finish this season of the show I'm watching. I'm switching to a different service one that doesn't contain mass amounts of repeatative advertisements. Not only that. But Hulu constantly disconnects with error codes. Out of all the services I use. Hulu is the worst
"As of 4/28/2023, video on my phone no longer fills the screen in full screen mode. There are also no settings available to adjust the video size or aspect ratio. This is bad for viewing and makes watching anything annoying. The picture is smaller than necessary and it has a border the entire time. Very bad."
"Seemingly impossible to upgrade subscription unless timing is perfect. Google Play only offers the version w ads. Disney+ bundle offers an ad-free option, but no way to activate the ad-free version while the Google Play version is in its grace period, to the end of the billing cycle. Why would they make it difficult to upgrade your subscription? Why tick off your customers when they're giving you more $ for their addiction? And the chat help was infuriating. 1st world problems, I know.."
"Can't play a series like a normal app, will just toss random episodes of garbage into the play queue of stuff not even in your favorites list and likely something you wouldn't ever watch in the first place, so you're then forced to change to other apps to watch what you like. Good thing this is a free service thrown into another streaming service as a value added benefit."
"This app is dung. That's the nicest way I can put it. It will play three episodes of let's say welcome to Wrexham, and then without fail it will crash in the middle of a fourth one while it's loading a commercial and will completely reboot my Chromecast dongle! This is bull. And just like that on time after 3 and 1/2 more episodes it reboots my Chromecast dongle. Fix your app! I wish I could give it zero stars but it seems nobody's listening anyway."
Hulu's library is very small and not that well stocked. The media player feels like it's from 2010. It feels like it mostly exists to make you want to add on additional subscription services. Also one of my biggest annoyance is that I signed up to watch the dubbed version of the original Dragon Ball. For some reason Hulu only has the subbed version! This is not clear until you have an account and can check out the library proper.
Worst app then anything else. Keeps freezing keeps giving error during shows or movies and exits you out telling you to try again. They are quick to say it's your connection with internet but this is the ONLY app that does this BS. No it's not my internet connection...it's you Hulu. You suck... horribly. Has great shows n movies but good luck being able to get through one episode without error interruption. Hate this app so much.
"Ever since I started the live TV service, this app has been terrible. I could be watching a program and the app will just shut off and take me back to the home screen. I've called customer service several times and it's always the same. Uninstall and then reinstall. I purchased this live TV service with a purpose. I'm definitely canceling in June."
"I'm very frustrated with this app. I was trying to cancel in Jan 2023 because I can't afford it. The app instead offered a rate of 3 or 4 something a month until July and I thought ok I can afford that. Feb comes and they still bill me the full price! I spent multiple days trying to talk to a representative and getting disconnected, hung up on. Etc. Now it's my fault I've given up trying for a bit but it should not be this hard! At all!"
"This app sucks, every time I want to watch a movie it would always say that it doesn't recognize the location, and also I paid for it to have no ads but there are still ads playing, I want my money back, and it says it has a lot of tv episodes, wrong it has only half the episodes and seasons of half the TV shows. I am going to un install this app, and I want my money back."
"Hulu has been my go-to streaming service for a while, but for the last few weeks, it's become unusable on my tablet where I do the majority of my streaming. The 5-second network ""ad"" plays, and then it can't switch to the actual video. Other streaming services work fine. Fix this nonsense, please."
"I watch on my PS4 more than anything and when i do, its a hassle. 1st when I decide to turn off Hulu or my ps4 and then come back to it, instead of it being on live TV, where i left it, it shows what i was watching when i turned it off then after about a min it freezes! Gotta reboot the app! Happens EVERY TIME! YoutubeTV never did this! I might be going back! Now Hulu makes me log in after they took out the funds for the past 2 months. Lowered the stars to 1. The last month im using this service"
If you have a large household and multiple devices this is a terrible app to use. I have to change the password every time I attempt to login a different device. For whatever reason it logs me out of my devices frequently. When I try to login it tell me to reset my password. Very annoying and the aggravation with this process is through the roof.
"Hulu itself is great but I'm reviewing the app, seems to work about 10% of the time, isn't this what's advertised to us, watch anywhere anytime, only time it works is on our smart TV...every time I try to open the app anywhere else, like my phone, I'm stuck on the Hulu opening screen until I give up 5 minutes later or until it gives up and says no internet, I have Netflix, Disney plus, and HBO Max, and they work just fine, so does youtube, which also needs internet...so upsetting!"
"Bought T-Mobile 5g internet for my home because the price is consistent and we live in an area where options are limited. Hulu can stream on my desktop, laptop, tablet and phone great. However, watching on my TV using Fire Cube/Stick buffers constantly or totally shuts off. Hulu blames T-Mobile and the Download speeds, T-Mobile blames Hulu and tells me to contact them since it runs flawlessly on other devices. Considering canceling service because no one can provide a solution."
"Hulu is a decent streaming service, I've had it for years. It can be better, but what service couldn't be, they have some good movies and t.v. shows. Although they've been going up in!! their price lately! so consider all these things before subscribing! PS as of lately this app has been going in and out in and out so I may decide to just let my subscription go completely ! ð¯âð¾"
"For $75 a month, I expect the app to not stop working during the final minute of a march madness game. Every other device connected to the internet was working fine including other apps on the same device. Just Hulu. Missed a buzzer beater, so Hulu, you get a one star. It's not like this is the first time Hulu has struggled like this either.."
"There's no way to watch episode after episode of the same show, it automatically switches to a different show. And then a different one. Then a different one. Etc. So you have to turn off auto play which means you need your device in your hands at all times to manually start each episode. Worst streaming app ever!"
"I use to really like Hulu but anymore I'm about to cancel them. I get constant error codes and it constantly crashes. They have went so far downhill it's not even funny. They better do something to fix it and quick or I see them losing a lot of customers. I know this is an issue with Hulu and not my TV, Phone, or connection because I have no issues with other streaming apps."
Customer service is no help at all!!! I am continually trying to watch shows only to receive an error message telling me to turn my TV off and on to no avail!!! I called customer service only to have him walk me through several useless steps to try to fix the problem and still to no avail. Do better Hulu. I want my money back and I will be canceling my subscription!!!
Horrible Unreliable and that also applies to the incompetent customer service reps I've spoken to so far. HULU is unable or unwilling to correct the problem. Every 3 to 4 months I've been automatically locked out of the service and my log in credentials are no longer accepted. Changed them multiple times because customer service had me do that and still locked out.
The shows on Hulu are great but the interface both on the website and the app are always terrible. I don't know why they made the change many years ago to the current structure. The app keeps jumping around and loses my place every time I move my phone. I wish these people would get it together and be worthy of their shows.
"Terrible. If you skip, the screen buffers and at times freezes and you have to close the app and start again. It happens all the time. When you don't skip it, it'll randomly close the app all on it's own. Both app and on TV as well as laptop will not work."
"Since I got the Samsung Galaxy 22, I haven't been able to watch Hulu on my phone. I keep getting this message saying my device doesn't support HDCP. If this is your way of telling your customers that you don't value them, you're doing a good job. I may just cancel my subscription instead of wasting $40 on this app. Also when Netflix can't charge my account, they don't hold my account hostage. They still let me use it until they can charge."
"Every single time without fail, if I pick a movie and press play, as soon as I flip my phone on its side or plug it in to charge, the friggin movie gets switched to a different one. This is very annoying and has been going on since the install. Please fix it. Also the subscription options are ridiculous. If I pay to use the app, I should have full access to all movies, not just a select few."
"The app constantly crashes and freezes up. I get kicked off about 7 times a day now ( and thats only about 6 hours of hulu being on a whole day). When you try to resume a show you started, it will just go to the beginning. I'm incredibly sick of it and it's not worth the money. By far the worst streaming app. I've never had this much trouble with any other streaming service. It says they updated for less crashes but I've literally had more crashes since then."
Hulu hates its customers. This app is horrible - I can support having advertisements - but there as to be a mechanism that doesn't require you to watch the same commercials over and over when you are rewinding. Biggest complaint is it continually crashes with Chromecast. At least once every couple of hours - usually after watching a commercial. Then once fixed - I get to watch the commercial again ð.
"How many times are people halfway through an episode then decide, ""You know what? I'd really like to stop watching this and immediately switch to the first season of a new show I haven't even read the description for!"" Seriously, WHY is portrait mode even a possibility?! And if it is, landscape should obviously be lockable. All portrait does is make it incredibly easy to accidentally click another show with no easy way to resume your current one. At least give us a ""previous"" button!"
"I used to really enjoy the Hulu app, they have many shows that I like, as well as many movies. Unfortunately when I stream Hulu to my Chromecast the app constantly freezes and then crashes. One 40min episode will freeze or skip 6-7 times in the whole show, and will typically crash at least 1-2 times while watching it. Hulu claims they have patched the issues, but clearly that is not the case."
"App crashes on all our phones, Chromecasts, smart tvs, Chromebooks, laptops, and PlayStations. It's a terrible app that does not work reliably with how much it crashes. No issues with Netflix, Amazon prime, peacock, Disney plus, paramount plus, or HBO max. Yes we have them all and all of them work fine except Hulu. Going to switch to YouTube live or something. $100/month for nothing."
Connection lost at least once per episode. Doesn't happen with Netflix or Amazon. What am I paying you for?? Also interface is terrible and slow to navigate. Constantly skips the last 5-10 minutes of an episode and starts the next one. This has been a problem for years with no fix!
"You can not let you phone lock, or switch to a different app without the show you are watching starting over from the beginning. This is REALLY aggravating!! Please fix!! AND any time I minimize the app while watching, the screen goes blank, and I actually have to restart my phone to get it off of the screen!"
Descriptionsof shows are way short with no real info of show. Crazy amount of Ad's every 5 min. And if you need to rewind a little yup you have to watch ads again. An didn't even get it to the right place in the show i wanted to rewind to. But have to get through those ads then proceed to rewind more just to watch ads again.. its like Watch or rewind a few minutes get into the show. Boom another round of Ad's. I understand the need for them. But this many? Worst I've had in and show/movie App
"App crashes when streaming to a Chromecast, then forces you to watch a full round of ads before restarting. On top of that, there is almost no ad-free programming even on the ad-free plan. I read and understand the fine print, but the ad revenue grab is so obvious."
"Ads consistently freeze at the last 1-2 seconds and prevent whatever I was watching from playing again. Sometimes I can start a movie or TV show, but when the ads come, I can't watch past them. I've tried force closing the app and uninstalling/reinstalling and nothing seems to fix it, so I assume it's an issue with the app. Pretty frustrating experience, I really can't use this app."
"This is the worst app out of all of them for watching TV shows and movies on the Fire stick. I have been paying for Hulu forany years and it's always had problems. Constantly buffers and glitches. If you pause a TV show and try playing it again, it starts on a different episode. It's painful. I wish some of these shows on Hulu were available on Netflix, which never has these issues, so I'd never have to use this app again."
"App was good before, some issues here and there but after last update 3/7/23, the apps completely stopped working. At first, it would kick me out, or restart shows after pausing or lagging when I would resume ( no big deal ) but now it won't even launch, just gets stuck on the Hulu screen. I've uninstalled and reinstalled in ALL my devices and nothing. Please fix. Thank you!"
Not good. I just got hulu back after several months and was quickly reminded of why I dropped it in the first place. The reason is because I can't use my phone to cast to my roku. That is how I watch most of my TV. This is the ONLY service that doesn't work. It used to work just fine but after the last update it stopped working. I will be canceling again. ð I had hoped it was just a bad update but it doesn't seem like it will be fixed.
"I have been able to use the app maybe twice in 6 months. Almost every time I've tried to use it I get a blank screen and then an error message instructing me to wait and retry or check the internet connection (which is excellent). None of the apps seem to be able to remember where I left off either. It's absurdly buggy for such a large company and has unintuitive UX. Netflix, prime video, and Disney+ apps are worlds better and none of them have trouble with the internet connection."
Terrible. On my android TV it freezes every 2 minutes. I have done every suggested thing. My internet speed is fine and I've Uninstalled and reinstalled. It just is a terrible app. I have no idea why they can't fix this issue when they charge so much. Guess they don't want my business. Which is fine. I'll just use apps that don't freeze constantly.
"It doesn't work. Played a bit of a cat movie and I couldn't tell if it had any sound. Then I decided to look for something else I mean anything else at all to play. Nothing but a blank screen or ads only then quits. Seems worse than a few years ago. Now, I have Not been able to watch anything on my 30 day before $7.99 a month Trial that started @11pm even after uninstalling and reinstalling app as well. So, in less than 24hrs. I will CANCEL HuLu forever, if nothing changes. Any suggestions???"
"This app is ridiculously bad. It crashes all the time. It randomly deletes stuff from my current watch list. Good luck having it remember where you left off in a movie. The layout is very inconvenient. Why they can't display the play/pause button in the middle of the screen, like literally all normal apps in the world, is beyond me. Hulu keeps increasing the subscription cost, without making any updates to their app and it's so messed up."
"The software is littered with bugs. I get blank screens 50% of the time. You can't remove items from My Stuff. Deleted recordings always show up after you return. I have a very fast connection so it's not a latency problem. These issues occur on the TV, phone and tablet. Web base seems fine; not many issues. This is a fraction of the issues found. Pathitic coding and QA. At least the UX design is good. Recommendations; fire the so called ""software engineers"" and hire proper ones."
"It is impossible to watch anything this app has to offer( except for the commercials, they run great , no problem there), everything "" skips"" about every 3 seconds. It's like it buffers for 3 seconds then plays for 3 or 4 seconds. This happens on absolutely everything making it impossible to watch. I'm closing my account. Get it fixed and I might try again at a later date. I'm not paying for something I can't use."
"Uodate: still horrible. Hulu doesn't care that even the most basic function of what we're paying for doesnt work. I literally cannot express how frustrating this app or service is--it's complete garbage. The last few minutes of a show pause and won't play--on ANY device. What a horrible, horrible rip off. This app is horrible. It continually crashes and/or freezes and never remembers where you're at or what you've watched."
"The playback is constantly choppy on my tablet. It's like the video and the audio are playing leapfrog with each other. No other streaming app behaves like this on the tablet. I would like to turn down the streaming quality, in hopes that less bandwidth will allow the stream to even out. But that's not an option as the device has no mobile data connection."
The Hulu App sucks! First there's stuttering during playback. The app doesn't refresh at the end of an episode to play the next episode. I have to exit the app in order to get it to refresh and reflect what I've already watched. The play next button is located too far to the bottom of the screen - very hard to tap it without tapping the timeline. Suggests I watch things I've already watched or rated.
"The app is always buggy. There's always something wrong. Lately it's been that DVR shows won't delete, or shows won't record, or the shows that recorded or are currently recording don't show up on the DVR list. Also, if I turn on subtitles it turns them on for ALL profiles, so everyone else has to deal with subtitles. We just switched to live and it wasn't an issue with regular Hulu. All of this happens on the phone and on tv apps."
"Too glitchy, too much buffering, and way too many ads. It's not as if Hulu is a brand new app, so I'm trying to figure out why are there all of these issues going on with it. It's so interesting how the free streaming apps play more smoothly and have fewer ads that an app that I'm charged a monthly fee for. It's annoying and Hulu needs to listen to their customers and fix these problems."
"Pretty bad on chromebook. If i skip more than a couple times in a video I have to back completely out of it or it wont resume, the video will freeze but the audio and subtitles will continue, and it's pretty slow. Edit: Dropping another star. Using it for a week and not just a day has made it clear this is horrible. I had to start the same video six times, twice having to reopen the app after it crashes among numerous other things."
"App was great until I updated. Now things are unwatchable. If you're lucky you only get either screen buffering, or audio skips every two to five seconds. More likely you get constant buffering as if you were trying to stream video via a free dial-up AOL-Online CD from 1992. Only seems to be a problem on mobile devices, which just so happens to be the thing I used to use this app for the most. (falling asleep to X-Files re-runs on a tablet)"
"I love Hulu and I am willing to pay for it. However my phone's carrier offers a package that includes Hulu. I prefer no ads, but instead of allowing anyone to pay the difference for the ad-free, you have to cancel with the phone carrier and pay the full price. Sounds really greedy to me! I am sure they get a percentage from the carrier, allowing to pay the difference for ad-free helps them get a bit extra. Making someone pay the full price, pushes me to not pay at all and stick with ads. Greedy!"
"For the past 2 wks when I open up the app and go to my continue to watch list, there are things there that I have already watched. At first I thought it was due to a new season to the series being added on but it wasn't. I remove those items from the list and the next time I open the app they're there again. I've never experienced this problem before by now it's a daily issue. Also, please put the stop and start in the middle of the screen, like it was be4."
"The channel is ok, and I don't mind the commercials, but unfortunately, the volume of the commercials makes the whole thing unwatchable. The volume is twice as loud during the commercials. The only solution we found was to mute the commercials. I like having the TV as background noise, but hula makes that impossible. I don't know if this is a not so clever ploy to get people to upgrade to the commercial free tier, but I am gladly giving up our subscription."
"The app and content on its own is fine. But the difference in volume between shows and commercials is insane. I can be watching a show and barely be able to hear it. Then when a commercial starts, it's like I'm blasting the sound throughout the whole house. Absolutely ridiculous. I understand commercials being louder but this is on a whole new level compared to any other streaming service I've ever used."
"Gets worse every day. Dont waste your time. Every show and movie has a 2-second delay every two seconds. It's insanely inconvenient and you can't even watch a full program because the delay is so bad. If this is an update then you need to do a better update, I tried uninstalling the app I've tried resetting the settings I tried everything I can. It's the app and it's happening on all of my devices tablets TVs phones. Update the app again already this is ridiculous."
"when I first subscribed to hulu everything was great. not so much anymore. I constantly get kicked out of programs I'm watching...live or otherwise back to the home page. frequently get a message across my screen saying they are having issues playing that program. the craziest thing is that once you set a program to record, there is no way to get to the root setting to cancel that recording. lol many times I can't even get the live menu to come up. and they just raised prices ... AGAIN."
"Good selection, but the streaming is spotty, freezing for a second on both video and audio every ten or so seconds. Very distracting when I'm trying to enjoy a series. I'll change this rating if the problem gets fixed, but for the time being I'd recommend watching Hulu online or through a streaming device over using this app, as all of those options work fine."
"New problem, New rating. It's only possible for me to watch shows when downloaded due to living where I work and working all over. I can't rely on cell service or wifi so, downloads are my friend. Now, every time I get on Hulu, it forces me to change my password which deletes all my downloads. It's literally impossible to use. I have canceled my subscription pending a fix. Sucks I was really into my show."
"Hulu app is awful, every time I try to watch anything it does a slight buffer every few seconds which cuts out the audio, and has the occasional video jump. Tried clearing cache, reinstalling, restarting device, changing settings, etc. And nothing seems to fix it. I only planned on using Hulu to stream on my phone, so there's not much point in having it when the app wont work."
"Constantly buffers, skips, freezes, and lags. Every few months, the app gets bugged up for a week or two and will not properly play video. It takes days before anyone at Hulu listens or corrects the issue. We pay for the Disney+ bundle as well as other services and Hulu is the only one that has constant issues. No other streaming apps give us these issues. Very frustrating. Avoid if possible."
"Fix the technical issues!! The streaming quality of this app just keeps getting worse. Unistalling and reinstalling it doesn't work. Everything looks like it's being fast forwarded very slowly. I can't watch anything. If it doesn't get better, I'll have to cancel my subscription, which sucks because Hulu has a lot of great shows and movies that I'd like to watch."
"I would give it four or five stars except for the fact that the app itself freezes and if I want to continue watching a particular show and I hit continue watching, it freezes again. I have restarted my device, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, etc but it still happens and it is very frustrating when it does happen. I do enjoy the shows that are on Hulu however. Fix the app and I will give you five stars."
"Used to be great. Along with a LOT of others I still have a skip every 10~15 seconds. I would be a little more understanding if I wasn't paying a ridiculous amount for an all unwatchable app. Problem is only with Hulu and does it on downloads too, works fine on the TV though. Downgraded my subscription until this improves, just saw the next price increase from $68 to 82."
Original review made in November: I cant use this app since a recent update. Every few seconds the sound and video hiccups. It makes watching anything impossible. It's been like this for weeks now. Fix your app hulu!! UPDATE 1/4/23: this app is still unusable! I tried watching something and it still hitches every few seconds. I even left it paused to see if it was a buffer issue. Nope. I'm uninstalling. Waste of space.
I kept getting the same error msg.over and over that's unavailable to play next episode and I've done all the troubleshooting possible and it keeps happening. also unavailable to remember the episodes that I've already watch. might cancel if it continues to happen. Too frustrating to deal after every episode watched. I was really happy with all the diferent shows!!
constant stopping. at times the dialogue doesn't match the video. Please fix as I pay for this and I have programs I am missing. This is the only app. that is doing it. The ads play smoothly. 11/20/22--I clearedthe cache; I deleted all other free view apps...still buffers and jerks around. The comercials play fine. The apps. that I removed played smothly. I then did a complete factory reset and it still buffers about every 3 to 5 seconds with the commercials being fine. FIX IT PLEASE!!
"The app just is awful on Android TV. The video either freezes or it plays with a black screennand no sound. I have tried clearing cache, reinstalling, and nothing works. Update: I really hate that Hulu has such great content that I can't watch because it just freezes five or six times during a 30 minutes show. I have gigabit fiber internet. There is no reason for this technically to fail, other than their inability to deliver the content that they have."
"Used to be able to stream my favorite shows without any issues at all, however after the last update l been having trouble with the audio not syncing with the image, lagging, buffering and freezing up. Already followed the steps suggested to fix the issues even as far as contacting Hulu's customer service and so far nothing has changed. Please fix the problems because based on what I saw I'm not the only one experiencing this problems."
"Overall Hulu has good content, but the company seems to forgotten that they're not an entertainment company. They're an experience company. The apps sucks. It's great when you hit play. But if you hit pause for any longer than a few seconds, it forgets where you paused. God forbid you pause in the middle of an episode and come back the next day. You will start two to three episodes behind where you were. This is pretty basic operations for a video app. I have no idea why they can't get this."
"Hulu is my favorite channel it contains all the shows I love, but I can't completely watch anything without service interruptions! On my TV or the phone app! I'm so disappointed that the quality of the channel has dissipated! I wish you guys could get it fixed because it's extremely frustrating! I don't have a problem with any other apps on my TV or phone just HULUð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡"
"Video pauses every few seconds and it appears based on the comments that many have this issue on Android with the latest update....will this be resolved soon? Any feedback at all? It has always worked fine on this tablet, and other streaming apps are still fine. Please advise. Update, I'm amazed to see how many others have this issue that's being ignored by Hulu, even prompting many to cancel their subs. What's the point of feedback if no one at Hulu monitors it."
"Typically love this app; however, since the last update it is constantly glitching, freezing, or closing itself out on my tablet and I find myself so annoyed I don't even use it anymore and have to resort to hunting down shows and movies on other streaming apps. It works fine on the in tv app but it does not anymore where it had been downloaded on devices."
"Liked the free trial so I decided to get a better experience but got worse. Upgraded to the $17 per month and all it did was take the adds off. Honestly most apps have adds so I didn't mind them all that much but even with the $17 plan you can't watch more than half of the movies they list on here. Honestly not worth spending extra cash when other app have it for free and more options. Worse $17 spent so far, would've been better spent on a movie ticket at the theater."
"This app was great until the November update. Now I can't watch anything on my tablet. Recorded shows, on demand shows, and streaming shows all buffer about every 3 seconds. I've tried waiting it out to see if it catches up, but it never does. Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime all stream flawlessly on the same tablet. I've cleared cache data, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and nothing. Sounds like I'm not the only one but Hulu hasn't acknowledged their issue or dropped a fix yet"
"subtitle sync is off. it starts ahead of the content. I'd have to force close the app, restart it, and restart the content. sometimes browsing then starting new content I can only hear sound, no image. removing content history from continue watching doesn't work. once the app restarts, the content that was supposed to be removed is back on the watchlist."
"I'm so sick of this app it has been cutting off around 1:30 am everyday for at least a year and it's really annoying . I usually play it to help me sleep, but that's being interrupted and I keep getting message failed to load Hulu please close and reopen the application. I've closed and forced closed several times and it's not working and this only happens in the middle of the night. I pay for this service so it should never cut off. I'm ready to cancel."
"This app is about the only thing that works for this service. I've been in contact with customer support multiple times about connectivity issues, TVs turning on and off on their own only while using this service. It is obviously my TV they tell me. Cancelled my service after years of technical issues and customer service attitude. Update: terrible service for deployed service members, can't log in from home for months, so not only technical issues, but a waste of money if you can't use at all"
"This app has made me want to quit streaming altogether for many different reasons. My biggest issue with Hulu is the add-on charges that get thrown on without the users permission. I didn't really enjoy that one bit. My 2nd biggest issue is how disturbingly ridiculous the customer service is. It was nice that I was able to get a month free as a way of ""fixing"" this unfixed bug in the system. However, I was charged again for more add-ons for no reason. I wish that this app would just function."
"After the recent update, everything has a constant stutter that cannot be fixed by any recommended methods. This is extremely frustrating as it makes viewing anything impossible to enjoy. I use a galaxy note edge (modified note 8) so there shouldn't be any reason your app wont work on my device. Update: Nearly 3 months later and this app STILL struggles with stuttering. The ever increasing prices is also getting tiresome. Unsubbing."
"App is fine. billing is trash. Used a free trial. Decided to cancel it a bit early before I forgot, thinking I'd still get the rest of the free trial. That didn't work, but the site told me that if I renewed within 24 hours I could finish the trial before being charged. So I renewed. Nope! Immediately charged to my card. Free trial gone. So if you are using a free trial and dont plan on keeping the service, dont cancel until the day before your set to be charged."
"Since the latest update, video streaming cuts out every few seconds. It's unbareable to watch. I have cleared cache, uninstalled, reboot, etc. Tried other devices and it's the same. Troubleshoot with my internet and route - same results. I even downloaded an episode and watched offline and the glitch remained. Tried another device, refused the update and worked seamlessly. Clearly there is a glitch with the latest update. Please fix. I cannot use the app with these constant static interruptions."
I only use the app on my phone while I'm on the road. The last update made it start getting a hitch in the picture. Like a freeze of the screen while the audio runs normally. Kind of like skipping. Anyway. I'm not happy about this. The selection is amazing and I very much want to use the app. I've tried reinstalling but it didn't work either.
Terrible video quality and connection as of lately. I had this app for years and it's been awful the last few months. Tried to contact Hulu but they give you the exact same suggestions you see online. No help at at all. Now it's actually stopping my video instead of glitching out every 3 seconds. I can't believe I pay for this. Seriously considering going back to Netflix!!!
"It's a rip off streaming service. Freezes and glitches a lot because of all the ad interruptions. How are you gonna charge me and still show ads. Half the tv shows on Hulu can be seen online with ads and I dnt have to pay a monthly fee. Also not all tv shows and movies are included, the popular ones you still have to pay extra for."
"It's great for live tv, other then it switches channels on its own, and glitches out a lot. but as soon as u search a movie and watch it, be prepared for multiple adds, especially at the last 10-15 min you get 9 seconds of the movie an 30 seconds of add, it's like it gets stuck in a loop of the same add over and over again, very annoying. Would give 5 stars if the problem gets resolved."
"I'm not one to normally harp about free stuff, but the amount of ad time needs some serious balancing. If you decide to restart a movie from the beginning, expect to see ads sporadically throughout the entirety of it. 30 seconds of ads followed by 3 or 4 minutes of movie, then more ads over and over. The last movie I tried to watch wound up in an endless loop of ads and wouldn't even finish."
"I like that this app h has to of the r old shows I grew up watching. However, after a while it goes into a loop where it plays just a few seconds and then jumps to commercials. It plays again for 2-4 seconds and then those same commercials over and over and over. Deleting cache and reinstalling the app works for a bit and then back to few seconds and the same commercials over and over."
"I've never been a big fan of this app because it doesn't give me a watch list so I have to search for the show EVERY time I open the app. I also hate how often it plays ads. If I pause the show to walk the dog, I get stuck watching a round of ads before picking up where I left off. If I try pausing when the ads start, I sit thru a round of ads then catch the second of show that came before, only to sit thru another round of ads! It's only gotten worse since the update. I'll buy the DVD instead!"
I would have given it a 5/5 until the update that I just had to do today. I was aware of ads going into it. And I was fine like standard tv. But now? The ads last longer then the time I'm watching the actual show. The average time BETWEEN advertisements is under 2 minutes. And I just had one under 45 SEC. Like I wouldnt be annoyed if it wasnt literally every 40 sec. at this point. Like this is me keeping the app open. And I have tried restarting the app too. UPDATE-Now it's 4-5 sec. Between ads.
The movie plays for 4 seconds then a commercial in the movie will play for another 2 seconds and then a commercial will start. It never used to be like this. Please fix the glitch because I do like the app before the glitches started. I was just trying to watch my movie and they couldn't even get one whole word out before another commercial started.
"Too many commercials too often. One ends up watching 1 hour or more of commercials for every 45 minutes of movie or television episode. In addition , said commercials are often occurring with a 30 to 45 second commercial break after only 4 to 10 seconds of show, repeated for many cycles. This makes Pluto unwatchable. It is beyond annoying. This is recent development and an unfortunate one. They have some decent content, made unwatchable by extremely excessive commercials. Time to uninstall."
"Far, far, far too many ads. I don't like the fact that you can't pause anything. The channels sometimes switch on their own-I HATE that! On Demand functionality is very poor. It has worked for me only once when I selected a movie, but when I exited and later tried to resume where I left off, the app refused to work that way and made me watch the movie from the beginning all over again. I will never use On Demand again."
"Selection is great for a free app. Bout all the good I can say though. Switches channels on it's own, even switching during a movie on demand to a channel on live TV. Way too many ads, and also however long the ad is you lose that much of a movie like it never existed. Freezes and loses the place you were in the show or movie a lot. Just WAY too many issues! They should contact the folks running tubi and learn how to run an add based streaming app."
"Installed to watch a movie I've been wanting to see but couldn't find. Found the movie through the search bar, started watching in Fullscreen, screen goes to black after two seconds. Tried several times, but always the black screen. This was through the web browser, I installed the app to see is there was a difference. Now the movie doesn't even show in the search results."
"I hate this app. If I pause anything, close out of the app, or it goes to ads, (which it does every five to ten minutes smh) it restarts whatever I'm watching. If I'm watching a show, I pause it to take care of my children or something, as soon as I hit play, it goes back to the very first episode. And then I'll try to go backan click on the correct episode again, and either five minutes of ads (that cause it to do all of this, too) or simply freezing and glitching out, then it stops altogether."
"After trying to watch one movie with this app, it's the worst I've ever used. Constant freezing, making you watch more ads every time you pause, losing your place in the show/movie, the same ads over and over, etc. After it loses your place you have to watch more ads just to find out if you clicked close to the right spot again. There's a reason a 2 hour movie is free, it takes more time in ads than you actually get to watch... They managed to make the cable we all cancelled even worse."
"It has a decent selection, but 1) it's so awkward to navigate 2)there's no timer for ads, like literally every other streaming app in the world has and 3) it's damn near impossible to pick up where you left off because they play an ad break every time you try to go forward, even if it literally just finished an ad break like 5 seconds prior and all you're trying to do is skip forward like 10 seconds. Pretty ""bar is on the ground"" as far as streaming apps go."
"When I paused a movie to take phone call, the app made me sit through every commerical all over again just to fast forward back to where I had left off (about halfway). I never finished the movie. It's not worth it. The movie selection isn't good enough to make me still through all of those ads again. I deleted the app. I hope your experience is different."
Worst experience! On demand movie stops 40 minutes in and automatically starts over from the beginning. Fast forward is not an option and skip 15 seconds just starts more commercials. I guess that's why it's free. What a waste of time. I'll stick to TUBI from now on. I give it 0 stars if I could. I can't even delete the app from my TV or I would. Looks like everyone is having problems now from the reviews.
"Worst ""free"" streaming app imaginable. There are 5 minutes of ads for every 7 minutes of stream time. And if that's not already insane, you must watch an entire movie or show in one sitting, because it does not save your spot and when you try to skip forward to where you left off, it repeatedly force stops you and makes you re-watch every single ad you've already watched. I just had to watch 30 minutes of ads to skip forward an hour to where I left off. Deleting immediately."
"Just as horrible of an experience as it is on roku. Horrible lag times. Constant freezing or failing to load. Horrible interface. Can't adjust favorites line up. You have to select a channel, wait for it to load and then select the channel again just to favorite it. The partner ship for Samsung TV plus is better. Not much. But better. This is just a horrible user experience and disappointment all the way around. The execution of it on the user end is just not there."
I was enjoying it on my phone. I recently purchased a Firestick. Not so much now. The channel changes once an hour on it's own. Bevis and Butthead and Jackass 3.5 is not meant for younger children. I find myself clock watching so I can grab the remote and be ready to switch it back. This happens during movies as well. Internet searches are reporting Pluto has it set like this as a setting we cannot control. It's free with strings attached.
"There is an infuriating bug with the app. When I'm watching in picture-in-picture mode, and an ad plays, my show will play for roughly 5 seconds after the ad, and then the same ad plays again. This repeats ad infinitum. It makes picture-in-picture completely unusable."
"This app sucks ! I've been a long time customer of Verizon and I have been with the pre throttle unlimited for six years, through this app they're trying to throttle my data use. The app will play a few moments of the programming and then freeze then show advertising...then a few seconds of programming followed by you guessed it. I just went through this again and again.... And let me talk about the commercial for paramount plus, I can honestly say that they have guaranteed that I will never use"
"The constant popup ads for paramount have got to stop. I'm completely fed up with it. The app barely works even without this god awful ad constantly interrupting everything I try to watch. Not only do you have to close the ad, which is entirely too difficult because the X button rarely works, but the orientation changes and you have to pick up your phone and rotate it twice to resume the broadcast. You've ruined a perfectly good app with your insatiable greed."
"I would have given 5 stars prior to the March 2023 update. Since then it is impossible to scroll through the channels on any of my phones. The channels simply sit there like a JPG. And you are stuck watching whichever show the app happens to open with. Assuming it doesn't get locked in the usual 'Please Wait' mode. Great before the update; waste of your valuable time after the update. These statements only apply to the Android app. With regards to the PC, Pluto TV is still excellent. Thanks."
The latest update has broken Pluto TV. For some reason I'm having problems when I click on the tv guide. It just goes into a long search mode and the guide never comes up. I can only change the channels by using the up and down arrows but you still do not know the titles of the tv shows that are on each channel. Also do not understand why the synopsis of what the shows were about was removed. Now have to go to Google search to look up the synopsis. I now watch this app less.
I've been using this app for years on my pixel 7. But as of the recent update it no longer allow you to change channels. If you select a new channel it will attempt to change but It'll just go right back to the one you were watching before. I know the pixel 7 is old but this issue should not be Hardware issue. As it stands the app is now unusable.
"This is by far the worst streaming app EVER The ads are un freaking real I understand the concept of a free app there will be ads and I'm fine with that but not when there are 82 ads in 1 movie(not exaggerating that number). The interface is a joke constantly glitching, freezing, closing unexpectedly, and (this is the most annoying) I'll be watching a show, ad starts, I switch channel then 2min later I come back to watch and it's showing the same clip from before the ad. Pluto needs MAJOR work"
"Support@ pluto.tv. I am unable to watch any programs my tapping on the channel. I can keep trying on other channels but it won't allow me to get any channel but the previous channel it is stuck on . But occasionally if I go back on Pluto maybe an hour later and hit another channel it will change to that channel ( not usually a program I like. Just to test if it will change channels.) Then once I think O.K. it's working and think I can select a channel now, nope, wrong,now it's stuck again !"
"All ads. No exaggeration.... 2hr 18min movie, over 70 ads. 5 ads, 7 minutes of movie, 5 ads, literally 4 seconds of movie, 13 ads in a row. Never less than 5 ads at a time.... over and over and over. Horrible. Just wanted to finish the flick. Worst streaming app I've ever seen as far as ads. And it's a shame because they have a few movies here I'd like to see. But won't."
"App sucks so bad when it comes to commercials. It makes you watch commercials multiple times even tho you've already done it. If you watch a commercial and have to close your phone and go back to the app, the app doesn't understand you just got shown a add so it will show you one again witch is a HUGE waste of time. You'll spend double the amount of ad time. And the y don't care at all."
"App gets worse with every update. Way too many ads, every 5 mins and the same ads over and over. Now you cant even save anything to your watchlist because it disappears when you exit the app. Update after the response- already tried that. Nothing stays in the watchlist more than a week or 2 at the most before it all disappears, doesn't matter if im signed in or not. Ive just accepted its a junk app."
This has to be the absolute worst streaming platform to exist.... the layout is ridiculous..I too often have to close the app just to get back to the screen because it freezes on the live TV tab... and the constant ads are INSANE..I'm watching a show that just came back from commercial...I literally go to pause and boom another 5 minutes of commercials... not worth it at all and this happens on my phone AND firestick
The app won't allow the screen to rotate and that sucks One year later and the app still won't allow my screen to rotate to full screen ... It seems Pluto has fixed the problem with rotating my screen. And now it has become a commercial app with brief periods of your selected movie or show. I watched so many commercials during a 45-minute show that I forgot what I was watching. ð
"Like the movie options. But not so thrilled how the app works if works at all. Takes forever to open app if it does open. OFTEN the app is pixelating, staggering- staccato & freezes. The dialog was based on English I think. It could be dubbing like the Japanese used to do. I QUIT WATCHING! I did try & watch later & was working fine for a hot minute. Later the app crashed & ð¥again. YES, I've deleted and then downloaded again..again..& again...& aaagaii... Sighs... Put a fork in me I'm done."
"Absolutely horrible!!! Way too many ads!!! Too many bugs. It glitches ever few minutes, then it makes me watch the ads all over again each time. On demand shows keep crashing and forcing me back to the live channel. I attempt to go back in and Finnish watching, it then plays the ads through twice in a row, showing a split second of where I left off in between. Needs to be fixed. It shouldn't take me an hour to watch a 20 minute show. I know the ads generate revenue, but this is excessive."
"Pluto TV has always been awesome. Iv had the app for several years, always worked great, until this recent upgrade. The live guide section stopped showing its contents. The programs don't slowly fill in as you scroll up/down.(some apps will do this). I have shut down device then sometimes it works listings shows. But if you collapse app then open up again no listing. I don't get what happened. I have Uninstaller reinstalled doesn't matter. This is extremely now very frustrating. It needs fixed."
"If I could give it a 0 star I would. it no longer loads on my streaming Channel lists on my Sony Bravia x85j. After the latest update it has been a disaster, it worked perfectly before that update. If you go on Reddit or even Google the problem you can read dozens or even hundreds of other people who are having the same problem. This used to be a great app but now it is the worst one for streaming and a waste of time to set up on your streaming channels list as it will just disappear over and over again no matter what you do. uninstalling it will not help as it will do it again.. It is a shame when you have something good that works just fine until you put your hands on it and mess it up and ruin it for everybody else."
"This app is excruciatingly painful to use. If I pause and th screen goes black, it loses track of where I was and the episode starts over. You can't adjust the track either because then commercials will immediately play, followed by a few minutes of the show, and then it will skip back to where you initially were before adjusting. I get the app is free but it's so inconvenient to use for anything on demand to the point where I'm just going to buy dvds of what I'm trying to watch."
This app on my phone and tablet has been a horrible experience. The Pluto TV app through Xfinity is just as bad. The only reason we downloaded this app was to watch the last 30 minutes of a movie that we started watching on Xfinity. The movie kept freezing up and restarting from the beginning. I figured it may be easier to watch the ending on the mobile app but boy was I wrong. The 1:23 movie is almost 3 hours long when you add in all the commercials which you are forced to watch!
"Has some ok programming. But it's all ruined by an unbelievable amount of commercials. I mean a sickening amount. Especially on popular shows. Ruins the whole experience. Can't recommend.. c'mon Pluto.. Additionally, it's nearly impossible to watch any on demand programming all the way through if u stop anywhere in the episode. Just loops to the point where u cut it off and won't pass a certain point in the show. Very irritating and frustrating. So what , it's free.. big deal"
"Was watching a movie. I get the ads, no problem. Near end of move Switched to another channel. No pause feature. You are not a good streaming service. Especially for someone who used it for the FIRST TIME. Doubt i will use again. Not user friendly. Sad I was hoping to find something a quarter way decent, you did not even make the 1/64th mark."
So glitchy you cant watch anything all the way through without several stops and starts. It freezes when you try to start an episode in on-demand. Also it will randomly change channels without touching it. A true dumpster fire. This app is horrible. Sone diamonds in the rough on here show wise but the movie selection is pretty low. They care more about promoting paramount plus than fixing this app.
"I'm an IT professional so I know how difficult it is to produce quality apps. This is the worst quality streaming app/ streaming service compared to YouTube TV, Tubi, Netflix, and Amazon Prime. I cast from Samsung S7 to a Chromecast on my flatscreen. Bugs: repeatedly looses sound after the first commercial in a series finishes; the audio sometimes doesn't match the streaming video; Chromecast will sometimes crash while streaming. Fix is always to restart video then commercials begin again."
"Was a great app. Now won't cast to my Chromecast. Won't cast certain channels, loses connection to my internet, and if I am lucky enough to get it to cast it messes up so I can't change channels or anything. It was great but with every update it gets worse and worse. Also there should be a way to automatically start the next episode instead of stopping the casting and just starting the episode over on your device. Thank God it's free because I wouldn't pay for this garbage"
"Something awful happened to this app. It was perfect. Well, channel guide doesn't work. period. Can't change channels, can't scroll through guide. Something plays as default that's it. On demand still works. What a waste. They had something here. Support was responsive but I'm sure it was a bot. As of 5/4/23... broken. Worst part is it WAS the best of it's kind. Back to XUMO and Flixoid clones. BTW... Paramount owns Pluto. The Site works but slow. Can't use working old version, forces update."
"Edit: I downloaded again. Will play for a few minutes then will shut down. Will get stuck in a loop and you have to shut off your TV to fix it. I've never seen so many glitches! Absolutely worthless POS!I downloaded this app and tried to watch a show. After the sixth commercial in a row before the show even started I stopped it and deleted the app. I want to watch TV, not non stop advertisements! I get that it's free but it's not worth sitting through 10 minutes of ads to watch a 22 minute show."
"It has a lot to watch if you're looking for classic shows. And I understand the need for advertising to make it free, BUT an ad every minute then again 30 seconds after EVERY time is a little much. every minute, 2 sets of ads play. One set of 3ads play, then what ur watching will pop back on for 30sec or less & more ads play. It took over an hour to get thru a 30min show. The longest I've gotten without ads is 4mins when I started using it last wk. Doesn't save ur spot or watchlist either."
"Literally has 3 minutes worth of ads, then 5 minutes of movie, then 3 minutes of ads again. I get that it's free and ads are necessary but that's ridiculous. Tubi is also free and there are maybe 4 ads in an entire movie. I didn't even watch my first movie all the way before Un installing because I'd been watching it for an hour and I was only 35 min into the movie. Not worth getting it for free, in my opinion"
"Gestures in this app are awful. There's no point in having a channel change section of the on screen display if every time a person breathes near the screen it interprets it as a swipe and changes the channel. Didn't go thru the lengths of selecting a show only to have it shut off every time I look at notifications or check the time. Also, this really creepy ad for the app I'm already using, shoved awkwardly between show breaks instead of content is just weird while also horribly repetitive."
"Absolutely terrible app! Just downloaded it about an hour ago to watch a movie. An hour later I'm 20 minutes into the movie because it keeps reverting to an earlier point. When trying to go forward, it stops at the closest ad break. I'm two ad breaks in, so I have to watch both in order to get where I was. I closed it and reopened, no difference. DELETED!!!!"
"Good app, good movie selection. But every time I get 3/4 through the movie, it jumps back, then play commercial. Then when I find where I left off I have to watch commercial again. Fine I get it.but this is the 3rd movie in a row its done this. It jumps back more than once, I've had to stop the movie back all the way out, close the app and reopen it and then find where I left off again. Not a very good way to convince me to pay for the premium option."
"This has to be the worst app I've ever seen. It's borderline unusable. I've never seen a better advertisement for literally any other streaming service than this app. Close the app in the middle of an episode? Good luck finishing it. The app loops you back everytime an ad break is hit. You can try to skip ahead, but if you end up hitting a preprogrammed ad break again you'll be forced to watch 4 mins of ads just to be sent back once more. I've ended up with 25 mins of ads trying to finish 15m"
"Extremely frustrating interface. Hard to navigate and not intuitive. I expect ads on a free platform these days, but they are excessive and repetitive to say the least. Not to mention, you have to keep re-watching the same long ad block every time the app glitches and skips you back to an earlier point in the video you're watching. It won't physically let me finish the episode once this starts happening, just kicks me back to the same spot earlier in the episode, more ads, â¾ï¸. Super frustrating!"
"Tried to watch John wick 2 on Amazon fire. This review is for that app experience. I made it halfway through, and then the video started to go back to a previous point in the movie. I would fast forward to the place in the movie that was next. Then it plays a commercial and goes back again. Fast forward, commercial, rewind, fast forward commercial rewind. Horrible loop. First time user, bad experience for the first experience. Have never had this issue with other free platforms such as freevee."
"Every movie, after about 1/3-1/2 the movie, at commercial points and sometimes random points it jumps back to that approximate 1/3 point. Causing you to rewatch same ads over and over and then have to skip parts of the movie to get past the skip point... which can only happen after you have watched the same sequence and ads a minimum of 3 times. Don't believe me? Try it. It's just a way for them to play 2/3 + times the amount of ads than they are supposed to under the guise of glitches"
"At first I thought this app was pretty cool until I tried to watch Jesse Stone. In the middle of each movie it cuts off and Loops back to 10 minutes prior, plays for a few minutes, loops back to a commercial, loops back 10 minutes...so I can never get past the middle of the movie and then it will eventually freeze. For the SECOND time I'm going to have to delete this app. Can't fully enjoy it so why keep it? Will reinstall if fixed."
"While I like Pluto tv, this app is terrible. Possibly the worst streaming app experience I've had in a long time. The video kept jumping back to the 3 minute mark after the first commercial then I would put it back where it had left off and trigger another full-length, non skippable ad break. It glitched like this 4 times in 20 minutes so I just gave up on watching the movie on my phone after I tried to go back to where I was and got stuck watching the same the ads for times back to back."
"My issue with this app is not the commercials, but that every single time I have to rewind or forward a movie it goes straight to ads. Can't find the spot where I left off without a ton of commercial breaks. One should be able to find their place they left off, then the ads pop up, but allow the customer a glimpse of the movie first. This app keeps restarting movie randomly. Don't make all this money with ads then give us a garbage app."
"It's pretty good except when I am playing a show (Ice Road Truckers) the episodes tend to get to a certain point and then like a broken record it will skip back a few seconds and replay those few seconds over and over again. Even if I try to skip forward, it will jump back to that point. If I close the app and try again, it still does it. So I end up just bypassing the rest of the episode and start the next one. Changed rating since seems everyone else gets this too on other OD shows/movies."
"Absolutely terrible. One misclick or one wrong move, and wherever you lasted watched an ad, you'll be stuck there. Even when you speed a few clicks ahead, you get trapped in a forever loop of ads that you already watched. It's ridiculous to the point your wondering if it's worth the trouble, the answer is no. Not to mention the set up is stupid, when people click the app, why is there a show playing loud and about? Possibly the most aggravating thing about this app."
"It used to be better! I liked this app, but now it has fallen way behind and has tons of ads that repeat in an infinite number of commercials, I can't even finish a program because of it, a 2 hour movie is a non stop of same commercials. I understand it's a free service, but it would be nice to at least be able to enjoy a full show/movie. Unfortunately, pluto is the only app that has the shows/movies I like, I would pay for a membership if they'd offer a better service."
"Horrible. The worst app for streaming anything. The ads are literally the same 4 ads over and over and over and over and over. Not to mention, it jumps to a different spot in the movie constantly and when you scroll back to where you were, ads again, even if you just completed the journey of Bosch tools, allergy testing through the mail and two shows I'll never watch in my life. Worst app for streaming ever."
This app has been my go to app for all movies and TV when I do find time to watch for almost 2 years and all of a sudden a couple of days ago its started to back track or jump to a certain part in the movie or show and no matter what it does it over and over again I uninstalled the app reinstalled and no change. It is doing this on all of my devices! AND when it does jump I'll try to close it about to its original place and EVERYTIME I do it makes me watch the ads again sometimes twice!! Fixplz
"I installed this app tonight for the first time, and like so many others, very unhappy with all the ads, approximately every 10 minutes, sometimes several minutes less than that, and each one starting with an ad about a crematory for Veterans, yay ð Many of the rest of the ads were repeats ð¥± Not only that, the picture kept freezing. All this within the first 45 minutes and for an old movie I've seen before. Not worth my time. So thanks, but no thanks, it's been uninstalled."
"I've un-installed the app twice. When I start an on demand show and have to quit watching halfway through i go back to finish the episode and it puts me in a loop. It will start where I left off play a few minutes cut to ads then go back to where I started. If I try skipping forward it puts me right back to the ads, if I let it play to catch back up it does it again. I just watched the same 3 minutes of a show 5 times."
"I would have rated this app 5 starts when I first started using it, all the sci fi shows I love to stream at my disposal, but the joy was short lived. About halfway into the second series I picked to watch, the video began to freeze, buffer, and go back to the beginning of the episode. At first it was just an annoyance and would play correctly after a few hiccups, but soon it was taking hours to get through one episode. I then asked for help troubleshooting, but only got an automated response."
"Awful App. Very glitchy. While watching a series, it will often lose my place and I have to manually start the episode & forward to where I left off. Of course this triggers commercials segments sometimes right after another. Other times it saves in the wrong spot. At times it jumps behind 10 minutes in the middle of an episode. Right now it seems to keep sending me back to this 1 particular spot in an episode. I have to fast forward, again triggering multiple commercial segments. The worst!"
"Unfortunately this app is pretty bad. Same film will stop and rewind out of nowhere. Also never plays all the way to the end, just switches to the next show as it pleases,not even smth I searched just completely random title and gets stuck there. Uninstalling/reinstalling didn't help.Clearing cache didn't help. This seems to be happening for a while Over the past few months I've used it here and there because of the same issues. Please work on these. I see I'm not the only one experiencing this"
"App sucks. In the middle of an on demand episode, it suddenly jumps backwards several minutes, and then a couple minutes of adds (commercials) appear. Try to fast forward.... More adds appear. Unable to view in full screen mode. Hey Pluto... Go look at apps like. Netflix... That's what you need to do. To much of a pain in the @$$...deleting your app."
"This would be fine. I don't mind watching ads that's not the problem the problem is that the video loops to before the ad then I have to watch the same ads over and over again and I know I'm not the only one experiencing this. Tbh if Amazon, Hulu and Netflix didn't drop Startgate SG1 I wouldn't even be using this stupid app and I never will after. I might just buy the digital version of the show so I don't have to deal with ads at all especially when I have to re-watched them constantly."
"Downloaded this app for our TV. Worst streaming experience ever. Repeatedly tried to watch a movie and it restarted the movie from the beginning twice. The last time we made it over an hour into the movie, paused it for a phone call, then had to restart and do fast forwarding. During each time of fast forwarding every few minutes skipped in the movie, there were 5 to 7 ads that you couldn't skip through. What a joke. Save your time and download a better app."
"This app fails at basic functions. When I play a video, it takes forever to load, and when it does, it loads a completely different video. When I click full screen, it automatically skips to the end for some reason. The UI is NOT user friendly and it's very annoying to use. I'm only using it because it's free this month, but after my experience you'd have to pay me to use it."
"The app is unusable, if you want to pause or even watch an on demand show later, it tries to save your spot but it ends up going back to about 1/3 of the way through. Then every other time there's an add it will play the add then bounce right back to 1/3 of the way through forcing you to watch another 3 minutes of adds. Like I said it's unusable."
"On Demand rewinds and repeats constantly. I love the shows available, but when using on Demand I can never get through a show because out of nowhere, the show will have gone backwards and I watch ad after ad after ad just to get lost it a cycle of me trying to get back to where I was, watching ads, having the show rewinds over and over again. It really sucks. Issue still has not been fixed. I watch more ads than the actual show. Skips back constantly and you are stuck watching the same scenes"
"The app experience is garbage. I tried to watch a movie and it randomly skipped back to an earlier scene 4 times. Every time it did this, I had to rewatch a 2 minute commercial break. I finally gave up and tried to cast it to my tv. It started the darn movie over again and I had ti watcht that stupid commercial break again! I give up! I'll find another way to watch my movie!"
"5 minutes of commercials, then 5 minutes of your show or movie. Then it's back to 5 minutes of commercials. No joke. It's a shame because there's some decent content buried under all the ads. Pluto must have roughly 5 times the amount of commercials than any other app I've ever used. Also there will only be a handful of different commercials and they just keep spamming them, many times the exact same one, back to back. SO MANY ADS THAT PLUTO IS NEARLY UNWATCHABLE. Unfortunately had to uninstall."
"*update* the shows keep rewinding itself back to an earlier part you've watched after it shows a commercial which is annoying and you can't finish it really** ..I hate how whenever the app is updated, it erases the watch list that you already have put together. So you have to go back and find all of these movies and shows again. I don't make it a point to remember each one. It's frustrating so I will not update the app again. This is the only free movie/ TV app that does this when updated"
"This is the dumest app!! Every time it goes to an add break it comes back to the beginning of the movie. So you skip to the part of the movie where you were and theres another add break, then back to the beginning again. I have tried multiple movies on multiple internet connections and still the same!! Do not doenload, you are waisting your time."
"Yeah the same thing everyone else is saying. This app used to be good, but in the on demand section, it is really impossible to watch anything all the way through. It doesn't pick up where it left off after commercial break. It goes way back in the show and after about a minute the same commercials start again. I have literally watched more minutes of commercials than I have of the movie and I'm not even halfway through. If this doesn't get fixed I'm going to give up and delete it. Had enough"
"It is filled with ads, but it is free so that gets a pass. The real problem is IT IS BROKEN, keeps switching to the titanic when I'm trying to watch saving private Ryan and it crashes my phone every 10-20 minutes, if they fix the bugs and you can accept that it is free then go for it but I heavily doubt they will fix the glitches and the ads are too much for on demand (IMO) so I'd say just skip for now and come back later"
I like the content a lot. But the app is awful. Can't watch any show without it skipping back to certain points and you can't move back to the spot you were because it triggers another ad and then skips right back. The only solution I've found is to skip the entire episode and try the next.
"This app is trash, I've spent 4hrs trying to watch a 3hr movie and only made it 3 quarters of the way through because it keeps randomly jumping back to an early part about every 10mins. Each time it does that I have to sit through an ad cycle, when I skip forward back to I have to sit through another cycle. Ended up giving up trying to watch it. After looking at the reviews seems like a lot of people have had the same experience, 2 thumbs way down."
This app is ridiculous. It won't open. It just stays on the start screen and doesn't do anything at all. When I first downloaded it a movie was already running. I tried searching for content to watch and couldn't find anything worth watching that would actually play. Now it's hours after I downloaded it and it's just stuck on the start screen. Two friends have this app and it works great for them.
"Excruciating viewing experience. Was pleasantly surprised to see a film franchise I was interested in, and then devastated to find the movie randomly resets to an earlier section at random intervals and then plays ads. Then plays ads again when I scrub back to where I was. It's painful watching that ad break knowing it's playing because the movie skipped back and that to resume playback where I actually am will require watching the same ads again. And even if I do that it may just repeat."
"75% thru film, a loop of commercials then 20 min. earlier in the film happens. This occurs 5 or 6 times during the film. Had to close app & restart phone ea. time. Then go back & find where I left off, only to be brought to another commercial loop. I know that is the reason it is free, but the commercials vs. film time need better structure & formatting. Def. not worth free. Could have paid the $2.99 on YouTube. It took me much longer to watch entire film w/ all of this nonsense. CLEAN IT UP!!!"
When I first downloaded Pluto TV it was a really good app I watched e ery episode of Stargate SG-1 from start to finish one right after the other with no problem.. now all of a sudden it doesn't matter what you try to watch you get to a certain point in your program and it will skip back to a previous point if you try to skip ahead it doesn't do any good it will still do the same thing.. I would have thought by now with all the complaints that have been logged that this would have been fixed...
"Could be so much better, first of all I get that it's free and you need to make money but the ads are every 5 minutes, when watching a 2 hour long movie that's 24 ads, they are nowhere near relevant to me, and I try to pause the movie after the ad(because you can't pause during ads) it's says can't control while ad is playing! DURING THE MOVIE. So now I cant pause the movie at all because it thinks its an ad. Terrible experience I'd rather get Hulu so I'd have to pay to see ads I can pause ads"
UNINSTALLING APP! When I watch a 45 min UK show it can last up to or even over 2 hrs. It happens when an ad plays and since they show the same ads over and over again and you cannot fast forward them I may go to the bathroom or do something else but if I take longer then the ad plays I will rewind the part of the show I missed but 9 times out of 10 I will rewind it to far and this will trigger the ad to play again which can last 1 to 5 min. So the 45 min program can end up lasting 2 hrs or more!
"Like everyone else is saying, the on demand part of the app keeps rewinding back to a certain point in the movie. After it rewinds it plays LITERALLY the same 4 ads everytime. Than after the ads are done I have to scroll forward to the part I was at. After I get there once again it has to play the same 4 ads. After, it rewinds 30 minutes back, ads play again. It's an endless loop. The one ad that is pissing me off us that Amy Schumer ad it's very annoying. She is like an adult baby,veryannoying"
"Don't waste your time. Can't get through a movie. It jumps back to earlier in the movie and immediately plays several ads. When the movie comes back on and I try to put it back to where I was currently watching the same ads start playing again. And it's several ads at a time, not just one or two. This app is a disaster. Deleting it."
"Super disappointed in the glitches while watching on demand movies as well as the live TV channels. I get 1/4 of the way through a movie and it freezes, jumps backwards and resumes play in a previous scene. Once that happens, it repeats the same jump backwards and resumes play in a previous scene. It happens identically a 3rd time, 4th time, 5th time, DO I NEED TO REPEAT MYSELF? This is no different than a scratched CD or Dvd..in the trash it goes. PLEASE FIX! I â¤ MISS WATCHING PLUTOTV!"
Having the exact same problems as everyone else can't even enjoy watching a movie because it no more than goes to a commercial break and skips right back to where it was you skip ahead it skips back had this problem on every movie I've watched so far at least 10 times per movie so frustrating I just stopped watching is anyone going to even attempt to try to fix this problem??????
Great idea. Poorly executed. For over 2 months every single movie i watch bounces back and forth so much you cant watch it. It keeps going back to a certain point and replaying. My app is fully updated and pluto doesnt seem interested in fixing these issues. Use tubi instead. It has better movies and nowhere near as many glitches.
"I would rate this higher but I seem to be experiencing the same thing that everyone else is. Movie will randomly just stop and skip back 30 minutes or so and then when you try to skip forward to where you were you get another set of ads and maybe five more minutes and then it skips back again. There is some good programming on this and I would love to watch some of these movies, but at this point I can't because I can't seem to get through an entire movie"
Will previously I was upset because you had a serious looping issue... You seem to have fixed that and your app was working just fine until a couple of weeks ago when all of the sudden commercials just start repeating themselves about every 3 or 4 seconds... You get to watch three or four seconds of your program and then a commercial and then the program comes back on for three or four seconds and then the same goddamn commercial... Over and over and over... you have a good app fix the problems
"Pluto TV WAS the leading free streaming television service. But they are constantly working to provide you the WORST experience. My last review vanished and despite the updates, this app has only gotten worse. My previous issue was that my favorites don't stick. I have an account and saved my faves on the mobile app, and when I log in to my account for my tv, they are gone. Despite the updates, still no faves and the app doesn't even launch it sits on the title screen. Xumo still works better."
"App is broken. I'm having the same experience as some other reviewers where after an ad the movie will jump back to a previous scene. It does so after moving back to the right spot too, which triggers another set of ads which causes it to jump back again. Makes watching anything impossible."
"Like others have shared, it's near impossible to watch on this app. My movie keeps skipping back and forth and when I rewind or fast forward to the scene I'm currently watching, I get an ad. I don't mind ads on a free service, but watching them because the app is glitching is getting old."
"It skips , repeats commercials, and skips back to scenes already viewed, skips, repeats commercials, then when you bring to scene you haven't scene, another block of commercials come on, then repeats same thing over and over. I was watching Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman when all this skipping, and repeating scenes, and watching more commercials happened. So I uninstalled, reinstalled hopefully to reset all to enjoy a nice evening of tv watching while crocheting. Let you know if any better."
"NOT GOOD AT ALL ... I have put Pluto on different devices and it still works the same in each, even on TV. IT FREEZES, it goes to buffing every 30 second, it takes long to see the channel guide because it doesn't download quick. **Pluto was taken out of the planet category because it didn't fill all the requirements to be a planet ... Let's take this PLUTO out of the entertainment category, it's not giving what other apps are. All of the reviews are bad. SMH"
"Can't watch anything on demand without it starting a loop and just playing ads over and over again. And if you close then try to gwt back to said spot of show or movie it just plays ads and reverts to last spot you left on then more and more ads. Pluto better fix this problem, it's by far the most annoying thing when all you want to do is watch a movie but end up watching the same ads forever on a loop."
"Been watching for about a year, and it's been great. Today poo hit the fan. After last update I'm unable to scroll thru the channels, shows revert back to earlier point so you have to watch same part 2 or 3 times. I don't want to delete the app but I will if the problem isn't fixed."
"Worked ok with earlier versions but the latest is terrible. These comments are about how this works going over to an older ""smart"" TV. It can't seem to find anything on my tablet even though I tell it right where to find it. I cannot get it to show photos at all as the interface doesn't give you the choice just video and music and music has never worked. Even though I set it to ""play next video automatically"" it just goes back to the directory which takes about two minutes to reload. out of room"
"This app used to work great on any Samsung phone I had, until now. Samsung S22 Ultra, and every time I open the app, I see 'preparing for first run' and I see the version info, and the opening picture, then it goes black. I uninstalled and tried downloading 19.4 from kodi.tv, same thing. I have it on my S7 tablet and firestick and it works fine. Just not my phone. Help would be much appreciated! And I will change my rating. I'll keep searching for a fix for now."
"Aside from erasing and then making it nearly impossible to remap to an existing home media server, it's also completely useless after the latest update. It's cumbersome UI no longer supports the best skins and themes available, it does not seem to be able to download and support any required dependencies in order to properly function. Every attempt gives a ""not compatible with this version"" error. Developer's completely blew it on this one."
I've tried multiple add-ons and can't get anything to play at all. I've tried different titles also. I've restarted my device. Cleared Kodi cache. Tried with VPN on and off. Tried LTE and wifi. Tried updating the add-on. It acts like it wants to play the video. A loading box will pop up for a few seconds then disappear. I used this app a couple years ago and it was great. Now it seems to be useless. The UI has always been a mess. They try to make it look like an entire OS. The keyboard is trash.
"When it works it's great, but over the past few years that's become more and more rare. It CONSTANTLY freezes and crashes, and I have to force close it more than probably every other app combined. I can't do anything with it anymore because of its extreme fragility, and so it's become worse than useless. Downhill and problematic since Krypton."
"07-22-2021 Crashes all the time. Sometimes a minute in, sometimes every 20 minutes. Cannot stream anything anymore. Buffering is just a sign that it's about to crash. Worst of all, it doesn't keep my place in the media anymore, and it freezes *every* time I try to fast forward or rewind. So I give up. It's an unenjoyable experience for a program that just doesn't work. 02-23-22 Program will not open at all."
This latest update is a total nightmare. My Nvidia shield just automatically updated the version 19.0 and not only did it break most of my add-ons but I can no longer view any of my media over the network from my home media server. I should have checked the reviews before uninstalling and reinstalling the app because now I have lost all my playlists and all my add-on configurations and it is still broken!
"Full of issues. I'll summarize since there's so many. Sluggish interface, many videos won't play or open really slowly, tapping on a menu or video is horribly inaccurate, audio loses sync, useless clutter like games/radio/weather, videos keep playing after pressing back, can't find a way to scan folders for media so navigating is cumbersome, fastforward/rewind is inaccurate, no gestures, no audio seekbar, no easy zoom/crop. This app is utterly terrible compared to others."
"My reason to use Kodi is for internal streaming, I have a central pc sharing 6 hard-drives. With Nexus I cannot access the share, I get the error ""operation not permitted"",and I can't get any help with the problem. I have recently purchased an Android tablet and a Media TV box and both are giving me the same problem. I have old versions of Kodi, 18.9 in one pc, 19.5 in another and same on another Media TV box and they work sweet as a nut. The new Kodi Nexus... Just stir clear"
Up until they rolled out Nexus v20 this was an excellent media player. 20 is broken on Android TV. I can't view my external HDD's and it's lost all of my TV shows in the progress. Luckily I'd backed my library up a few months back but still had to scan some of my library back in on 19.5. In my opinion 20 is full of bugs and doesn't function. I'd suggest staying on 19.5 if you value your data.
I still can't set up my Kodi game controller. When the heck is somebody going to fix the ongoing key mapping problems. I know it's not my controller because I can set it up on kodi 19.4 no problem at all. Kodi gaming SUCKS !!!
"Used to work perfectly, but with the latest update it will not play anything from my network library. It can see the videos but will not play them."
"Got updated to 20.0 and nothing works. The only notification I keep getting is that indigo doesn't work, but that's it. All scrapers and apps etc, have stopped working. I thought Kodi was better than this, it certainly used to be, but this latest update is just awful."
"Update is garbage on nivida shield can't use it at all as I don't know how to add my media from hdd. Why change it, never shows thumbnails either. Back to VLC"
Rubbish - Will not play .vob files on Nvidia Shield TV. That would seem to me to be a very basic functionality for a video playing app.
"Currently full of bugs and crashes as soon as you open the app. Message on screen advises to wait until devs fix the bug. Before this, 5* great app."
"Doesnt start after recent Chromecast update. No splash screen, only black screen then it closes. Aby idea how to fix that?"
This version of the app doesn't work on my X88 Pro 10. It won't even complete the setup process because of a Permission error. AVOID downloading this version as long as you possibly can. Perhaps they will have fixed the bugs by then.
"Great until now. Been a kodi user for 6 years now. Why all of a sudden is Kodi requiring access to all files and media on my device? This had never been necessary before and now, you receive a prompt when you attempt to open the app and if you don't give the permissions, it kicks you off. I, like many others I'm sure, WILL NOT be giving full access to my device to kodi. FIX THIS and I will reinstall the app. If you don't, I'm out."
"worked fine on 19.3 then auto update happened, but it wasn't an update but a new installation. All library data needed to be rescanned but the app does not recognise video files to scan even though it can find and list all the folders they are in. wish a rollback was available because this new version is absolute RUBBISH"
"This used to be my go to for movies and TV, now when I try to open it it freezes after a few seconds and then closes on it's own and it was working fine yesterday, does anyone else have this problem? Suggestions would be well appreciated."
"Not working after update to 20.0. I am not able to install anything from a zip folder, the file explorer shows empty folders and that shouldn't be the case cause I already made sure I had the files in the folder. Please fix!!"
Long time Kodo and XBMC user. Unfortunatly it appears that this version was released without proper testing. Every file I try to play causes immediate closing of the app. Log shows nothing. Samsung Tablet. Shame.
"Awful. Tries to be too much whilst failing at the basics. I've got an mkv video file here of an episode , Kodi won't even show it in the file list yet VLC shows and plays with no issue. Been using Kodi for years but just tired of it not even doing the basics of playing videos. It's rubbish."
No longer works on my Samsung S9 phone or s10.1 tablet. Just a black screen and battery goes flat in minutes. Used to be great
Kodi don't open up on my new Samsung Galaxy Note Ultra 20. All I've got was a black screen for a long time.
I've been using kodi for about 5 years now and loved it till now. About a week ago it wouldn't open so I Uninstaller and reinstalled and it worked until today. Today I opened it and nothing? I got a warning saying there was a bug and to update but there is no update!!!!! What do I do????
Please add manual video quality mode again in tv option after update it have no manual video quality option it always show video quality default mode when we try to change quality otherwise it consume too much data Please fix this error ðððð
Samsung says there's a bug in the app. Wait for an update from kodi to see if it fixes it.
Google managed to uncheck my disable updates option to install the new version of Kodi. It ruined my setup as it's not compatable or just has glitches. I also side loaded Kodi and didn't use the play store yet google gets there paws on my installation. Very invasive of google. Kodi needt to offer a version that google can't touch.
Playback resume no longer works in v20 update. SUPPORT NEVER REPLIES. FORUM IS USELESS. LOOKING FOR ANOTHER VIDEO AND STREAMING APP THAT WORKS
"new version crashes, old version was ok, but new one crashes on MI tv -stick, tried everything from rebooting, re-installing .How do I go back to old version , tried two more devices, android s905 box and firetv, they all crash when the enigma2 plugin is installed"
"Used to work perfectly, but suddenly the only thing I get is a black screen. Tried rebooting, tried emptying cache. Even reinstalled. Nothing. When passing the ""first run"" screen and accepting the storage privs it goes black. Funny thing is that the back button returns the classic kodi button click sound, but it won't take you anywhere. Read somewhere that someone with a switch managed to get it to work with setting a static IP but for me that does nothing."
"Unfortunately, I have to rate this as a fail, as far as updates go. I've been using Kodi for many years on different platforms. I basically use it to play movies from a vast collection of them that reside on a windows machine being used as a NAS. Since they updated to Matrix, it's impossible to connect to the windows shares, even though it claims that it's compatible with the latest SMB protocols. Is not only the android version, the windows version behaves exactly the same, I'll stay on 18.9."
"the latest,20,started randomly shutting down.then immediate crash at starts.now perma-black screen,no splash,etc.and for those cocky snobs saying it's me,not the software,I've been messing with it since xbmc came out.if it worked before an update,then craps out afterwards it's obviously a kodi gimp up-.-"
"Doesn't work l, downloaded app says it's starting up first time and then screen goes black and it does nothing. Have tried to uninstall and install again. Does same thing. Using a Samsung Note 20 ultra 5g."
"I downloaded 19 from mirrors.kodi.tv google play updated it automaticly, none of my installed add ons work and if i downgrade i'll lose my watch history."
Simply worst player ever. Unintuitive crashing app with wierd settings
Utterly useless. Can't get anything without some complicated extra downloads
Won't work on Chromecast with Android TV after the latest update!
Worst app on the galaxy too much buffering and making large data usages and keeps closing automatically worst app
"After the update non of my SMB are visible, unusable... Still on 20.1. Terrible app."
App wants access to all files on phone and sd card and the ability to delete them!
"cannot even access wont let me access at a33, stop updating does not work"
"Rated 5 before. garbage now. You must provide All Files access, not just Media files to use the App. Even (when using app) is not enough. Uninstalled after years of use."
"The version is not working, everything is unavailable to load channel. Please fix this in live tv channels , unable to load channel in Android tv. I hope this will fix soon"
"Wow...the last version that actually worked on my phone was v18..tried v19 & had to uninstall. Now v20 isnt working either, black screen on start up. Inlive in hope itll get sorted"
"Just installed Kodi + Goplay addon, and the first problem pops up : there is no way to paste email / password credentials. I use a repository with very long unreadable passwords, i really dont want to type those char-by-char"
"The end of Kodi , it was once the only way to stream and a great app and software but now nothing loads and it's very rare for it to work"
"After recent update, does not recognize any video files on connected devices. What has happened? Help!"
"Another year of epic Kodi fail, still not fixed the high refresh rate bug, still near to un navigable in touch mode, still riddled with bizarre slowdowns. New to me but probably an ancient problem, play radio recordings from Nextpvr backend and it cuts out every 10 to 20min. Suspect it's a screensaver detecting no video, but they provide no options to control it. At least on the firestick I have buttons to press to restart play, not so easy on the phone touch screenð¬"
"Kodi use to be the best place to find all your movies, tv shows, sports. Currently gving a rating of 1-star because the app crashed everytime I try to play a movie/show. Just found some great add-ons to watch movies and shows, but now it's very time consuming and frustrating to re-navigate every time to find your movie/show over and over again until it decides to not crash on you. Please please find a fix for it!"
After installing kodi then trying to upload any add on the colon is missing from the keyboard on the screen rendering this feature useless
"Used Kodi since back on XBMC and never had this amount of issues! Starting with SMB issues which are just annoying, HDR oversaturation, microstutter on movies, half the add-ons don't work and takes 7 minutes to update my library every time! I don't use builds, I don't stream, I use it for it's intended purpose and it doesn't work. I will be downgrading to 18.9 but what a total waste of time and effort re-creating all my smart playlists and setup. Don't fix something which isn't broken!"
"Just did the Kodi 19 update, Absolutely hate it. I loved it before this update, was simple and easy to find anything I wanted to watch... now however that is not the case. Hard to find shows I watched before, hard to get it to play anything and it crashes all the time. It doesn't show a description of the movie/TV show. Been trying to get it to play one TV show for almost an hour now, and only been able to watch one episode since 5am. Its terrible!"
Cannot install add-ons. Even if I used the local storage. Can fix this? All access already given to the app
"Doesn't work for me, I do a fresh install, asks me to give access to the file system, so I do, then a little loading bar fills and the screen goes black. Every time I hard close the app and reboot it, it's just black. Guessing from everyone else's reviews it's just a device isolated bug, but still, would expect it to work on a Pixel phone."
"100% Does NOT work with my device. The start up screen starts to load for less then a second or two & then goes completely black. Force Closed Application. Restarted Phone.. Cleared Cache.. Cleared App. Data. Tried adjusting my application settings. Background Data usages. Uninstalled. Reinstalled. You name it, I tried it.. Nothing worked. I love Kodi. I am BUMMMED. I want my KODI !!!!"
"I would have given this ZERO stars if that were an option. This new update is total garbage! I've had many different versions of Kodi over the post years and none have been as tag as this. The one add-on that has ALWAYS worked now doesn't. I've deleted it off my devices and I'll check back in a while to see if it's fixed but for now, I'm out."
"The initial setup is overly complicated, abs. terrible experience. Adding a upnp source (syno nas) to the movies library just drove me totally nuts... The solution was finally found, discussion boards, as usual, but yet again terribly nonstraightforward. I could have used smb instead, yeah, I know and it did work with smb, but it's generally easier with upnp. Sort of click it and forget it - it's by far not the case with Kodi. Switched to Nova video player - much simpler and easier to use!"
"Tragic! After installing the screen goes black and phone is unresponsive. Had to turn phone off and on again and remove. Maybe I'm cursed but Kodi only works on the desktop pc. Neither the Android app or ios app works, so I can stream from my server to Chromecast, for example."
"AVOID updating! Version 20 is completely useless on the NVIDIA Shield TV. Doesn't seem to respect the settings in advancedsettings.xml, so I can't even scan to my MySQL database. Also, and probably the most important, it won't play files via network or USB as it crashes immediately. Downgrading to 19.3 whilst I research a replacement media platform. Sorry Kodi team but this is where I get off the Kodi train. Been a good run but I'm done with nonsense like this."
"Kodi worked very well on Android boxes, until v20. Now it cannot install fully due to the opening dialogue box, which will close the program if not given permission to record audio. All of the options given will result in shutdown by permission denial, even if you allow it. This may be due to the fact that my Andriod box DOES NOT HAVE A MICROPHONE. Why does it need this anyway, seems like it could be Â¿spyware?. Time to downgrade back to v19.3, until 20.2 fixes this."
"The latest version just buffers when I stream files from my local NAS. 19 has become slow, limited, too much work to get it to do what I have been using it for since Xbmc and when it was an alternative to Windows Media Center. SPMC is no longer being developed, but at least it works and doesn't completely bog down my Nvidia Shield Pro 2019. It pains me to see that this great project is going down the drain. Good luck, it won't last going like this. Left beta and Uninstalled all devices."
"Since 19.0 Matrix just 1 star. Why? Well I mainly use it to stream all my series, movies and documentaries from my NAS over NFS. Since 19.0 when playing 2160P LOTR any Extended version, after 1 - 1,5 hours into the movie the image begins to stutter regulary, audio keeps playing without stutters though. Very annoying. 18.9 Leia works flawlessly for me. Went back to this version. WTH does it go stutter in a new release?? Things should be improved instead of worsening them!!!"
"Horrid! Don't leave 17.6! Wish that I never downloaded this. It just stops and goes back to the streams and or just freezes, it is horrible!!! I want to know how to go back to 17.6? Why would you put out something as unstable as this is? Kodi is wonderful, fantastic....but this is the bottom of the barrel. Please fix or provide the link to get 17.6 back!"
"So it crashes all the time. Enough to not want to deal with the app at all. I've been researching the reason as to why, and basically it comes down to Google made some changes with Android 10. But it's not up to Google to change things for an app to work again, it's the platform and Kodi Android Developers are going to have to figure it out or shut this platform down, because this is the way forward for Android. Soon enough all Android based phones will be Android 10 or better."
"I have to change my review. I installed the Kodi and like many have said it won't run on newer devices running the newest Android. It freezes on startup on a black screen. As for others complaining about their 3rd party addons not working now, it states on their websites that they won't help with those because of legal issues and they didn't create them. The new update probably made it so 3rd party addons won't work now. They definitely should fix the Android compatibility issues though. 1 star"
"Was best, doesn't work now for Jio Tv. Not able to download JioTv from repository as it says ""Could not connect to repository "". It was working flawlessly earlier but doesn't seems working on any of the devices I have including android TV and Samsung tab. Please fix the bug as it is great app to have!"
It's not working on android tv box . Kodi 19.0 was working but I can not download older version now please help urgently thanks
"Superficially, a gorgeous interface. Absolutely beautiful and _looks_ like its been well thought out.... Unfortunately, once in the app, it is damned near impossible to get out of it again. This beautiful gui maroons the hapless user who is unable to find the home screen which seems to have the only exit door. Its not just me, I asked other users what I'd missed - but all were frustrated by the same problem. The plus side - it easily connects to my NAS. If exit ptoblem were fixed, id give 5*."
"The last version 19.2 is not compatible with addons that worked perfectly. And let you like in the beginning, finding the way to configured again to make it work. A Waste of time!!! There are oder apps that work without easily and good. BYE BYE KODI thank you for the past, but what a disappointing version."
"After the first initial start following the installation, the app cannot be started anymore on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S7, it's showing only a black screen and nothing happens. Force closing the app doesn't fix the issue. With the previous version of the app I didn't experience this problem. Currently it is unusable on my device."
Not working just see a black screen
"I love Kodi - I've been using it for more than a decade. However, they should either recommit to or drop the Android port. Having no default skin adaptations to phone-sized touchscreens and lacking very basic media playback features like using the notification system to continue music playback after the screen goes to sleep are key failures. The contrast between Kodi and best in class mobile media playback apps like Pulsar and VLC is glaring. Having a half-assed app isn't really serving anyone."
allow kodi record audio why ? it wont work if dont allow kodi record audio. developers destroyed working beautiful app with this update.
Really unintuitive. Could not even work out how to get it to scan the content on my phone and cast a show to my TV. Every other solution I've come across makes that easy. Kodi... doesn't. It makes you scan through pages of tutorials and advice on the internet to get the simplest things done and life's to short for that.
"When installed v19, I can't use it. My screen is showing blank. V18.7 doesn't have this issue. I wish devoloper can resolve this issue. It seems like this new version is not compatible with Samsung Galaxy S21. It is blank when open the App. I tried to install it on 2 new S21 phones, same thing happens. It works on my old Android phone though."
I didn't get far enough into the app to try it out. I gave it the permissions it needed and it went to a black screen and never passed that. I tried multiple times and also cleared the app's cache and storage. I'm using a Pixel 4XL.
"I got this in hopes that I would be able to use LocalCast to stream videos onto my Chromecast. But not only did that not work, but it didn't even work when using VLC Player, another media player with built-in Chromecast support. The only good thing about this app is its ability to calculate video end times, but what good is that, really?"
"great on Linux. OK on Windows. Hopeless on Android. Despite quality media player and screen, 1280x720 is all that's whitelisted, rendering an illegible GUI and washed out fuzzy video playback. Stutters and stumbles where other Android players are seamless. I had to give up. Update: will not play in background or when screen lock comes on. Oppo phone."
"please fix the streaming issue on v18.0 leia!! where it used to stop and buffer, it now just streams constant lagging, stuttering playback (video affected only, audio plays fine). The buffering was annoying, but it is now completely unwatchable! happens using every add-on and stream I've tried since the update. I have had to downgrade to v17.6. please fix!!"
"Version 20 is like the worst thing ever... Crashes all the time, nothing works.."
Buffers way too much. Very slow going between different scenes within the program. Very poorly programmed in handling resources. If this is open source I wish somebody with more programming experience takes it over and clean up all the bugs. It buffers within the programming it's self because it's so poorly programmed.
"kodi, dispite its years of development and its enormous community, it still is just an mediocre app. there are way too many options and methods that should exist and are just not included, it does not have a decent library management interface or control, crashes half the times and recently (as of the writing of this review) it just does not even startup - on running the app, the loading bar appears and after a few seconds it just shuts down when it was supposed to enter the home screen. just a very poor planned, concepted and developed app."
"Now I got another review which is frustrating, it worked fine for a week with no lags, buffer or crashing and when it stopped working, no video on one channel but just hearing it, I re installed, then failed to even open up the channel, I switched to a new file on the same site I downloaded and gotten even worse, now buffering and then crashes all the time in just seconds, now I know why I even quit before.... (I tried to see if VPNs make it better but every I download, channels fail to play)"
"Kodi stopped working on my Samsung Galaxy S21+ 5G. It shows a blank screen when I launch the app, and I have to force quit to get back to my home screen. Rebooting and re-installing didn't make a difference. It used to work on my Galaxy Note 8 but I don't know why it stopped working on my S21+. I also tested Kodi on my wife's S21+ and it doesn't work on either new phone."
"I am using kodi 17.6 on a galaxy tab a tablet. I can use this app a few times fine, but after that the app doesn't open anymore. I have kodi on my television and it works great on it, but not here. I can redownload the app, but that gets annoying after a while. Can the operators of the app please fix it and I will change my rating. Thanks"
"Update to Matrix came with many issues and hours of troubleshooting. Ultimately, ended up downgrading to restore full functionality. I don't use a lot of add-ons so the change to python 3 didn't worry me, but changes to smb and auto-resume were troublesome enough to wait for a future release."
"At this point it doesn't work on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 with Android 11. Once I grant the permission for file access I get a black screen and no matter how much I wait, nothing happens. Tapping the ""back"" button doesn't make Kodi ask for anything, so I have to force-close the app. I'll keep it installed for a while, and hoepfully it will work with a future update. Same issue on my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE."
"SMB broken. Unknown error 8216. Saying ""oh we're using SMBv2 because it's more secure ððð"" isn't helpful when you haven't updated the UI to adjust for the new protocol. The app completely lacks any kind of useful feedback or help for configuration, just a bunch of nondescript, completely unhelpful error messages."
Version 19 is a nightmare. It couldn't read any drives from my main PC. Had to delete it from NVidia Shield and my Android tablet. It was easy to go back on my PC to 18.9 but I will have to side load it on my Android devices. Horrible quality control and lack of testing on the part of the programmers.
"I don't remember any app that was made unusable after a single update, aside from Kodi. After update 19 app is literally unusable, half of the add-ons don't work, it won't launch on screen with refresh rate of more than 60 Hz, I can't connect to SMB shares 18.9 connected to without any hiccups."
"Very disappointed with the latest version (19.0), like everyone else, lost all my add ons upon migration. Luckily I took a backup of userdata and reinstalled 18.9 and got everything back. Switched off auto update and won't be upgrading until they get the it working properly. Surprised with all the Alpha, Beta & Release Candidate testing this didn't come up; serious failure on QA here. Please get it sorted."
"When using this version on my NVIDIA Shield TV Kodi would stop regularly during playback, which was getting rather annoying. I just wanted to come on here to say that I found a solution to this on the Kodi forums and it has something to do with the version of 18.1 on the Google Play Store. I downloaded and side-loaded 18.1 off the Kodi website, turned off auto-updating for my apps and haven't had a problem since."
March 2022 - just downloaded latest version to see if any improvement to stability but on reading latest reviews here and a quick 'try out' I have now uninstalled. Would be good if no stability issues. 2019 Review... I must be missing something as there are 'some' good reviews but I find this product quite unstable. Would certainly benefit from thorough testing and inclusion of detailed error/information messages prior release. Not all negative though as after all it is a free product.
"unfortunately this app had so much potential, however in over 10 attempts over the span of few years I was not able to get use of this application. Event the stable versions, the basic functionality is not not working at all. I am talking about installs on windows, android tv box, firestick, they all have same issues. It is not even possible to exit the app, very disappointed .."
"It's all gone south now! Version updated and EVERYTHING stopped working, really, even the stuff that was left enabled by KODI (which wasn't much) doesn't work either. Now I've worked hard on my config and it's, in one fail swoop, hosed, so I'm really unhappy that this release came out without consideration for any of the users. This must be one of the worst app dev decisions ever. I gave it a go to see if it would just take time to migrate to the newer version so I went through the add-ons that hadn't been 'disabled' and checked for updates...yada yada yada ... and started one of them. Only to watch 3 and a half hours of two circles spinning round, that's more than acceptable for something to configure itself to a new version of anything. KODI now stands for shame in my books, break everything and pat yourself on the back for it, so many people not only let down but left with trashed systems due to this ridiculous abortion of a 'new version'. The field is now open for a successor to KODI after this."
"Happily updated and disabled all my add ins as incompatible without warning... uninstalled. Here's an idea, before pushing out a new version when so much has been been changed make it a separate release until rev x.5 or something so devs have had chance to update add ins. Dont want to have to disable auto update for EVERY app in future Poor show!"
This app is useless poor and very low quality waste time don't work well tv this app update. anytime not working tv channels this app rate is 0 star
"Very sporadic. Works when it feels like it. Deleted and reinstalled numerous times. As a post script to this review, it is now 11 months later and the app is still very sporadic and unstable. I recently bought a Roku television and I have the same problem on the Roku tv as I have with my Android phone. Fox New Channel works sporadically. Here is a post script. It is now May 2023 and I have given up on Roku, thinking their system is faulty. I bought a Firestick and I am still having problems."
"I really enjoy the articles and perspectives on this app. Overall the app works very well. I cannot, however, stand watching videos on it because the on screen controls are on all of the time and the screen darkened. Fox Nation app does not doing this. There used to be settings for the app which no longer appear. None of the setting for video affect it. Reinstalling several times did not help. Wiping cookies for every browser on the phone did not help. Wiping the phone is not an option. Annoying"
"I've had this app on my phone for a very long time, I think since they started it. The advertisements are getting out of hand because when I want to view a story I missed, there is a 30 second add before it and there is no possible way to skip it. When I go onto the next news story I want to view, either the same add comes up or another 30 second add. To tell you the truth, I just deleted the Fox news app off my phone and going to Newsmax. Add a skip button and I'll come back. Thanks."
"I have been using this for 2 years and have had no issues. However, in the last few months the usual fox ads during radio streaming have disappeared and replaced with spectrum 1 ads that run as many as 8Ã continueselly. This happens with other ads as well. It also interrupts interviews I'd really like to hear This is so aggravating and wish you'd fix this. I'd hate to stop listening. This is the only reason for the one star. It brings this app down that far. Please repair this issue."
"The way this app functions is the worst I have ever experienced. Get rid of the left/right swipe the takes you to another article. If you deviate one iota from a perfect vertical swipe, it changes articles. Swiping vertical near the bottom takes you away from the article. Adds cause the page to move. Loading more comments takes you back to the top when all you want is to see what is further down. I can reload if I want to go back to the top for the latest posts."
"I thought people were exaggerating when I heard how buggy this app is, but to my surprise it was far worse than I could have expected. It loaded pretty quickly, but froze any time I tried to click onto a different story. It got to the point where it was eating so much data that it crashed my phone and had to restart it multiple times. Tried deleting and redownloading, nothing helped. Will be getting my news from better sources! Do not download this app if you want your phone to work!"
"This app looks great from the outside looking in but once you download it, it shows its colors. It completely freezes every 2 mins or so to the point where you eventually have to restart the app, the interface is poorly designed and hard to navigate. I also was having trouble finding certain articles because their search bar is horrendous. 1/10. Wouldn't recommend."
"First of all, the download for this app took about 30 minutes and it slowed my phone down to the point where I couldn't use it until the download was finished. Second, this app is extremely frustrating!!! It is not user friendly, it has too many bugs, it exits itself out after only a couple minutes of use, and it freezes my phone. Very disappointing."
"When I opened the app, it automatically exited me out. I opened it again and it was lagging so much. I deleted it and tried again, and this time it opened. I was exploring the app for a couple of minutes when all the sudden, it started glitching and slowing down my phone. It drained my battery quickly. It was also complicated to use and very glitchy."
"Right away I noticed the app is impossible to use. The layout is terrible, the 'news' it gives is heavily biased and inaccurate, it glitches and slows the phone down, it freezes up and refuses to load and it's just all-around not a user friendly experience. I can't imagine how using this app would be worth all the trouble it causes on the device."
"This is a horrible app, I was hoping to stay updated with world problems but it seems to only focus on a small area of problems. It also seems very biased oh, but I guess I wouldn't know because it kept on glitching and loading. I spent a solid hour trying to read articles and watch videos but I could barely read them because the words overlapped. It also took a very long time to download, would rate zero stars if I could."
"The app is overall just slow and doesn't work as efficiently as I had pictured it would. There also seems to be a glitch with the app as well and can't go long without random adds popping up out of nowhere to weather reports, deals on furniture, or early bird meals from local restaurants in my area. This app is very frustrating to have and I don't recommend at all."
"The screen constantly jumps around due to ads. Why is the ""read more"" even there? I usually read most of article before it kicks in, it knocks me back to the first two paragraphs. I usually have to press three or four times, and half the time it picks up an ad from below it. Then I have to go back and find where I was. The ""rotate screen"" so you can be bombarded with yet another ad. Ads covering up parts of articles. Uninstalled the app, easier to go to the website."
"Rewind, pause and fast forward ""buttons"" do not disappear from any videos in app. For example when playing a clip in an article, the video stays dimmed with all the function icons overlayed on the video and do not go away allowing the video to brighten up and see what's actually going on clearly. Been this way for a LONG TIME. Needs to be fixed. Seriously. It's 2020."
"For a LONG time this app has been broken. I get a push notification and can see the title but when I click the alert, it takes me to the app with an error message and the option to refresh that does not work. If I go to the home screen I cannot locate the article. It is maddening. I have Android S10+. Both app and OS are up to date. Please fix your app! Furthermore there is no option to report issues in the app. ð¤·ââï¸"
"The ads are so terrible it's not even funny. I use this app often, and have never had any problems before but it seems to keep going down in quality every day. The news is bad, its not sourced correctly and grammar mistakes are disastrous. Is also hard to use and navigate, the controls are glitchy and overall, recent experience shows it's failing ability to produce good content."
"I really wish Fox would fire all their IT people and bring in a new team.  Up until a few days ago the app was working really well.  I could start the live feed and close it.  It would play in the background and I could listen to the audio while I went to other things like checking email, etc.  It would continue to play until I opened the app again and press the pause.  This was perfect and so much appreciated.  A few days ago, all this stopped.  Now the live feed stops after the buffer runs out if you go to another app or lock your screen.  Even if you leave the app up, it doesn't override the screen timeout so that the screen locks after 10 minutes (my timeout setting) and then the app stops after it runs through it buffer.  I have the Sirius app for when I'm on cellular as the app is such a data hog, but when I'm on wifi I like to use this app.  I don't know who's responsible for screwing this up but I wish they would be fired and replaced with people who don't break things that are working perfectly.  This is on a Note 8 with Pie.  If this is a Pie issue rather than a Fox issue, the same termination wish goes to the Pie people."
"Overall bad. I got this to listen to news, but everything is always super laggy and nothing works right. Everytime I try to watch a video, it just shows me a loading screen forever and the video never plays. I can never read articles, either. Of the article loads it's all garbled and the words are kinda overlapped. Very strange, never seen a news source do this before. Disappointing, but I hope with maintenance issues it can be fixed."
"Unreliable. Every time I open the app it glitches out, freezing when I try to tap on news stories, and sometimes even shutting off my phone. I know that it is not my phone's fault because it is 1 month new and every other app has worked out perfectly. The one time I succeeded in opening a news story it froze and played several pop up ads. It also drains my battery tremendously, and once I uninstall I hope it doesn't have lasting effects on my new phone. 1/5, don't recommend."
"This app has become nearly unusable. Tap to watch a video and it takes nearly a minute to load an ad, 15 seconds to watch the ad, then almost a full minute to start watching a 30 second video. Very frustrating. Also, you tap on an article but a different article shows up. You have to browse the app to find the same article again and try again. This app needs to be reworked with maybe a more passive approach to ads or just clean up the loading times. Follow Youtube's example."
"This app is still glitching. Even when I updated it, it still slow and none of the bugs that was supposedly fix, aren't fix! Not only that, the new that's being reported is extremely bias and mostly one-sided. As a student whose majoring in Journalism, I high recommend not to download this app. Slow download, crashing nearly every 15mins & freezes here and there."
"I was looking forward to having another news source available to me but the experience I had with this app was just unacceptable. To start, it took well over a minute for the app to get past the open loading screen. Once in the app I noticed the only way to search was through a list of categories, there was no way to search for specific articles. I was also appalled to see how biased all the articles were. Almost all of them extremely political and with out a doubt leaning hard to one side. ðð"
"No matter my views, I always like to do research on things instead of just taking my information from one source. Lots of Fox News coverage and articles are heavily biased, which was sad to see. The videos attached to articles kept glitching, so I couldn't even see what was happening. Instead of leaving where you left when exiting an article, you are automatically taken to the top, and then have to scroll down to the article you just read. Sad to see these things when the app just got updated."
"When I first opened this app, I experienced numerous glitches and my phone kept freezing when I tried to click on various news articles. I would also like to point out that while the app itself was downloading onto my phone, it froze my home screen and it took a few minutes to unfreeze again. I just felt like maybe there is some type of virus or bug that is causing these issues; I'm unable to read any of the articles, so it's not worth keeping on my phone. I don't recommend the Fox News app."
"Used to be one of my most used apps. It was fast even if the internet connection was not great. Now with the update almost everything requires an extra step because ""This content cannot be displayed in app."" and you have to click a button ""OPEN IN BROWSER"". Once you do there are so many adds. etc loading the page keeps scrolling back to the top forcing you to go looking for where you left off.  Also, very frequently the same video pops up over the content forcing you to wait to get the ""X"" button so you can close it. Then you have to go looking for your place again.  Another thing happens, you are in the middle of reading something, then what you are reading is covered with some other stuff and a ""Read More"" button that you have to click and go looking again for where you were.  This new version is TERRIBLE and extremely frustrating. I am about ready to uninstall it!"
"I was very disappointed in this app. I thought I would be able to get the news quickly and easily and be able to watch the videos without a problem, but the app is riddled with bugs and glitches. I can never get the videos to play, each of them taken at least a minute to load if at all, and half the time after it loads it gives an error message and tells me to reload the video. Not to mention the constant barrage of ads every time you click something, the majority of which are unskipable."
"I think my least favorite part is that it automatically sets up the audio from anything you watch to continue even once the app is closed. I mean, there are plenty of issues to go on about (system crashes, the amount of ads, the poor visual set up, ect.) but the audio thing is just really obnoxious. Offer it as an option first, dont just sign me up for that and then jave me try to figure out how to fix it. Imagine someone not technologically advanced trying to figure that out."
"I have used your app for several years.the content is what I like, until now. What have you done! I have a s7 which has worked perfectly until several days ago. I am able to access the headlines. If I try to go into and read the story, every time the screen is touched it jumps back to the beginning. Impossible to read. Please fix this for my s7!!"
"When I downloaded this app, there didn't seem to be an issue. Until a few days later. I put the app on the first page, but the icon skipped to the second. It was really difficult to open and would take forever to load. So instead of getting my daily info I would be staring at a dark screen for a few minutes. It constantly told me live feed was pending. Also it was extremely difficult to pause and kept playing 5 minute ads I couldn't skip. So sadly, I will have to give this a 1 star review."
"Watching one of the fox opinion shows is not an option. I watch the video, and if a text/phone call comes in the video drops. Whether I answer or not. Then I need to go back, select the video, and now it starts over from the beginning, not where I left off. I can slide the bar into the middle someplace but then I have to watch another ad, and try to find where I left off, and sometimes the show doesn't even come up again. This doesn't work at all. We need better results."
"I wanted to use this app to keep up with daily news. However, it was extremely difficult to navigate not to mention the countless times the app itself crashed. The few times I was able to use the app, I was bombarded with biased information. I confirm and cross-check everything I see in the media, and did the same here. The facts presented were skewed, altered, and sometimes outright false. Bad app. I wish it would stop crashing."
"The app's layout was mediocre at best. I couldn't be on the app for more than 4 minutes without it crashing, and in worst cases my entire phone would freeze. It genuinely wasn't worth the time and effort of trying to get through the bugs and glitches that are heavily peppered through the app. Just watch the TV, it's a lot easier that way."
"One of the poorest quality apps I've ever downloaded. Not only did it use nearly all of my data this month within a few hours, but it's incredibly glitchy as well. The quality is pixilated, it's constantly buffering and I have to open and close the app about five times before it starts actually functioning. It's not worth the hassle; get your news somewhere else :/"
"This app is Terrible! Don't get me wrong I love Fox News but the app is absolute garbage. It took 30 minutes to download which didn't make sense to me because I have a bunch of free space on my phone. And once it finally downloaded my phone became super laggy and slow. I clicked on the app and it crashed immediately. After five more trys it finally stayed open for more then a half a second. It asks for every single thing you have on your phone. Your music, your photos, everything. Terrible app!!"
Wow such a bad app. Fox news needs a ton of work. I got so many notifications from this app that I had to start turning off my phone cahse it was so disruptive. It kept trying to get me to download all the other apps and then there was a pay wall at some point. It also crashes semi-frequently making it so annoying to try and use. I would not recommend downloading. Dont even get me started on the poor content.
"Absolutle waste of space on my device. First, the layout of the app is terrible and I can't find anything Im looking for. Second, the issues I ran into when just checking the time on my phone was trash. I couldn't log onto any other app as soon as this hunk of garbage made it on to my phone. The glicthing and slow load up speed is not worth it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"
"This is a bad app, it lags on my phone and I find the quality of the content very low. It also seems that the app is running additional processes in the background. All around a bad experience with this Fox news app. I would not recommend it to anyone... There seem to be additional processes running in the background or something because it is very slow and laggy. Don't like it at all. Sorry Fox news, better try again another time."
"Frustrating. Articles are not kept in chronological order, making any search for new headlines a chore. Worse yet, the story headlines jump places while you are in the process of looking at the home list. Just a few minutes ago, I was in the action of opening an news article when it completely disappeared before my finger made contact with the screen. I want to read the news, not play whack-a-mole."
"This app is terrible. Used to watch live news every morning, now it just spins and never loads. I'm a big fan of FOX News, but there's no excuse for their app to be this unreliable. Edit: Signing back into my provider worked. Although, previously it would prompt me to sign-in after a short trial period. I had to go through settings to sign into the provider. I'm pleased with the support, but feel the app still has a lot of kinks to be worked out. Thank you for your assistance."
"Very glitchy and laggy, sometimes I can't even open the app, I try to play or hear the news but it just loads FOREVER and I mean for a very long time, I have waited at least 30 minutes everytime I want to hear a broadcast. I've trying reinstalling or updating it but nothing ever works. I'm very disappointed and dissatisfied, I would recommend other news apps like CNN, they're less glitchy. I really hope you can fix the issue, such a shame."
"I recently wanted to try and get more up to date with the news, but the app just doesn't work. I tried to open it several times, but it would not open, only freeze my phone, which could only be undone by restarting the whole device. I uninstalled and reinstalled which finally opened it, but once again, the app with glitching, slow, and freezing non-stop. There were way too many virus ads that'd popped up on screen. If I could give 0 stars I would."
"This app has a ton of trouble opening, and when it finally DOES open, it crashes. There was one attempt I made to open it and it worked, but then when I tried to leave the app, the sound from the video I was watching kept playing. I swiped the app out of the background, and it was STILL playing. I uninstalled the app, and guess what? the audio was STILL there. I had to shut my phone down to make it finally go away. 0/5."
"This was my go to news app for years, but now it won't stop crashing. The ads are more annoying than ever and cause the screen to move while ready articles. Not sure what has happened over the past couple of months, but I am ready to uninstall the app since I can't get it to stop crashing within minutes of opening it. Very disappointing ð"
"This app is not user friendly at all. As soon as I opened the app and tried viewing the videos, it took me to a whole different section. It was like wherever you tapped in the app, it took you somewhere completely different than it was supposed to. Spent 10 min just tapping everywhere trying to get to the videos. Not worth it at all. Would rate it 0 stars if I could, this app is completely messed up"
Terrible app. Loved listening to the news on cable but this was just bad. Constantly crashes when I try to open it and lags when it does. The UI was completely unusable and confusing. Articles aren't loading properly and videos don't even play properly. Notifications are constantly bugging me. Sometimes 20 times a day. Terrible app. 0/5 ð¡ð¡ð¡ð¡
"This app is a joke. At least for Android it is anyways. This thing works better when you do the free preview for 10 minutes, rather then when you sign into your provider. Then, it just locks up and if it does work its nothing but adds. I have Un-installed & re-installed so many times now I've lost count. Its the only way to make this ""thing"" actually view live TV. BEST ADVICE... Don't even sign into this thing and just keep doing free 10 minute preview. That way you can at least view live TV."
"I have had this app for about a week and ever since I downloaded it, there has been nothing but glitches. In addition to that, I noticed that there was not one article that didn't have any unbiased information. Alot of one sided news stories, lies and propaganda. Do not download. Look into AP news sources instead. Much less biased and the app works great."
One of the worst performing apps on my phone. A significant number of their headline stories are consistently unavailable when you try to view. Worst thing is they don't care and try and fix this issue...been going on for year's. Switching to another source for news. Another thing is if you click on the video in the story it has nothing to do with the story you were reading.
"Nonexistant video quality throttling or even selection so when not on wifi vid has to buffer for 20 second every 10 seconds of playback. No picture in picture minimizing like is standard on the youtube app so if you have to answer a text you have to stop playback on the video feed completely. No screencast option i can find so I cant send the feed to my TV if i want to switch and have continuous playback. All in all a very low tier, barebones effort that doesnt improve on the experience you can get on a web browser, and will undoubtedly collect more info about you. Needs work, will fix review when product is fixed."
"DELETED IT! GOING TO TRY NEWSMAX. This app works intermittently, whenever it feels like it. I hate to see a notification pop up about a story I click on it and the app spins and spins and spins. About to delete it, It's a waste of time. I uninstalled. Got tired of hearing the sound and never being brought to the article."
"Used to love the app. Now it decides to blast some song out of nowhere, and it is extrememly loud. I cannot stop it. It even does it when my phone is on vibrate. I have gone into the app and phone and turned EVERYTHING OFF, but to no avail. I wrote an email asking for a fix but never got a response. If it doesnt get fixed I am going to have to stop using the app. It is that annoying. I see many other people having the exact same issue. Please advise of a solution."
"I had high hopes, but couldn't have been more let down. With an unattractive and near impossible to navigate interface, this app looks like a beta test for a high school programming project. The load time is atrocious, and the constant flow of adds make for an overall horrible experience."
"The format is great. Ads are not intrusive, easy to scroll past. The one-star rating is because the app crashes every single time it's open for than a few minutes. I have a Samsung S6 with 16g memory, 32g storage, and 128g micro card. Every other app works flawlessly, so I can't blame the crashes on the phone. I'd love to keep using the app but I just uninstalled it and am using the website version of Fox on Firefox now. Just couldn't keep dealing with the constant crashes"
"Terrible experience. As soon as I downloaded it my phone started glitching like crazy and vibrating seemingly for no reason. I read the terms of service and it openly stated that they will use and sell your information. Then they requested access to my photos, contacts, location, and email. I don't want them to sell my personal information so I'm deleting and never using again."
"This is the WORST app ever. It makes my phone lag every time I open this app. It makes it impossible to get out of the app. Not only does it cause the phone to lag it causes screen glitches. Anytime I try to tap on an icon, my screen glitches out. This app also creates content that is very confusing and not user friendly. I would highly suggest to NEVER get this HORRIBLE app."
"TERRIBLE! Takes up an insane amount of space on my device! It drains all my battery as well and made my phone EXTREMELY slow. At one point my phone wouldn't turn on no matter what I did! When I did manage to turn on my phone, its said that my files were being deleted to make space for Fox News! I lost all my photos and files!"
"Horrible! This app took one and a half hours just to download! There were so many pop up ads, it was way too slow and kept freezing my phone. Every time it froze I had to reset my phone because it froze everything! DON'T GET IT! I think I lost pictures on my phone because my final try resulted in my phone shutting down completely!"
"Not only is this app glitchy, it sometimes causes my phone to freeze for hours at a time. I can't even click on an article without a minute delay and a blacked-out screen. Plus the few articles and news clips that I have been able to access are so poorly written that I would almost prefer a frozen phone. I've seen second graders be more logical and unbiased when writing. This news channel clearly doesn't value the quality or credibility of the information they're putting out into the world."
"The second I opened this app, I noticed how laggy and full of bugs it is. The information offered is highly biased, and I can't even click on an article without it throwing my entire phone on the fritz. I restarted my phone to see if that was the problem, but it only started once I downloaded this app. Once I deleted it, my phone was back to functioning normally. It's extremely buggy and laggy, the articles are often rarely fact checked, and it drained my phone battery."
"i noticed this app runs in the background even when it's closed; it ended up using all of my data for the month and i had to pay extra out of my paycheck. very glitchy, videos are stuck on the loading screen and news articles take about ten minutes to load. bad layout. the last time i tried using this app, i had just clicked on it when it froze my phone and i had to restart it entirely. horrible app overall."
"What happened to this app? I have been a daily viewer for over a year. It used to be so simple to click ""watch live"", and it would work. Now, it just spins as if it's trying to load the video. Same problem even after logging in through internet/cable provider. The problem happens on my phone and tablet. I tried reinstalling on both devices - problem is still there. Let me know if you put it back the way it was. Until then, I'm deleting. I have spent all the time I'm willing to on this."
"Videos on this app (besides live tv) stop working seconds into the video... The entire 30 second commercial before the video works fine tho! I have the S10 plus and no other video problems.... Ever. This has been occurring since last year although it wasn't a big deal because it was once in a blue moon. Now the problem's here to stay apparently and i cant get any response. Uninstalling, I'm done."
"They seemed to have fixed the logon issue, but not there is an issue with over play on commericals. Several commercial get played over and over during the same commerical block. For instance, I watched a CICI's commercial 6 times back to back. ""Kevin and his need to call for a ride home"" has been played so many times that the people in my office have requested I switch to different TV programming. I may give this app another chance after a couple of update cycles."
"Don't get this app it's so glitchy and drains my battery so quickly. Not to mention the news they provide is biased and unreliable, but their app does not work properly either. Whenever I try to open it it glitches and freezes, and the only way to close out is to turn off my phone. When I turn it back on, my battery is dead. Don't get this app."
"When opening the app on my phone, suddenly there is loud annoying music that plays. There is no way to stop it unless I kill the app. Knock it off or I'll kill it for good!! Update: It's not an ad. It's both when the app is launched or when I've been on it for a while reading articles. It doesn't matter of it it's on the home page or reading an article. Not an ad, but some Fox News Hillbilly music. I can try it again tonight when I get back to my phone."
"Dear Lord. Where do I begin. This app is SO BAD. Just from when I downloaded it, it lagged and crashed when I tried to open it FIVE TIMES. I even restarted my phone and waited a bit to see if it might work, but to no avail! Crashed a sixth time, and even froze my screen for a bit after the restart! I did manage to get it to open *one* time. In that time where I decided to read some articles I realized just how horribly biased they are anyway! Not even worth the effort. Deleted it."
"When I downloaded the app and first opened it, it crashed. It glitches and is super slow. It tracks you more then necessary and uses A LOT of data. It has way too many ads and makes it so inconvenient to get news from. I recommend going straight to the source and skipping over this middle man because they don't know how to report very well."
"This app is broken and needs to be fixed. The video function locks you into that mode and you cannot stop it without having to go over to App Setting and executing a ""Force Stop"". This problem surfaced back around the early fall of 2018 when the app was updated. I have removed the app several times since then hoping that this problem would get fixed. I just downloaded again and it still has this problem. I noticed in the reviews that many people have complained about this problem to no avail."
"Unless I'm able to figure out how to turn off the foxnew noise (chime) every time there's an alert, I'm getting rid of the app!!! I've even tried putting it on vibrate and it still makes the chime noise even when my phone is on vibrate. Unacceptable, especially when you're in a situation when your phone is supposed to be off. And because of this I would give it 0 stars."
"Great app but after any video starts playing, the on screen controls doesn't clear and the screen itself remains somewhat darkened. I'm talking about pause/play, 10 second advance and reverse arrows on each side of the pause/play symbol. I have checked all the settings I can find. It doesn't happen in any other app on my phone such as YouTube. Can you please fix this because the video is useless for watching. Other wise 5 stars fixed."
"Like many others have stated, this app has become unusable. I always loved the app and the notifications but now the app just won't open. I have tried everything to correct this, cleared cache, force stop, uninstall and then reinstall, and nothing has helped. To further frustrate me, you can't view the website in your mobile browser as long as you have the app installed. So for now the app is gone, and the website works fine on chrome mobile browser. I just have to deal with no notifications."
"This app is surprisingly poorly made! The quality is really low, so pixelated it's hard to see. The app crashes every 10 minutes and the UI is incredibly glitchy. Navigation isnt consistent and feels like a maze trying to get around. Excited to download this app so it's really unfortunate that it's glitchy to the point of being unusable."
"Ads. Anytime I open an article that takes me to a foxnewsbusiness url the content is condensed so you have to click on ""Read More"". 75% of the time clicking on it opens an ad instead of the rest of the article. Separately from that, there is a loud ad that plays when just browsing the headlines. If this keeps up I'll quit using this app. I hate being assaulted by the noise when I'm in a quiet place trying to peruse the news."
"I'm overall really disappointed. I downloaded this to watch the news since I don't have cable, and it hardly even works. Everything was fine for a couple of days, everything was loading, the ads were disruptive, but I could get over it. But after then, it really just started to get... bad. Each video/ article took a good 5 minutes to load, the ads began to get longer and more frequent. If I were to zoom into an article, the ads on the side would follow, covering what I wanted to see"
"Very disappointed in this app. Very inefficient. Used to work much better in the past. Now it is difficult to read the full articles, difficult navigate where you want to go in the app. I have reinstalled, but that doesn't help. Unistalling this and going elsewhere for a reliable news app that functions well."
"This app is sooo buggy! I downloaded it and it kept crashing every time I would try to open it. When I finally got it open I tried to sign up. The layout of the app is so difficult to figure out. The tabs don't work. It wouldn't let me make an account. I spent 3 hours on this app. All the while it was completely draining my battery (seriously, I've never seen an app drain my battery so fast! It died twice while I was trying to use it and my battery was at 100 when I opened it!) I could go on..."
"I've used this app for a very long time. Recently, it seems like half their ""videos"" aren't videos at all - just pictures with words. Also, there's the new service you need to pay for to get the ""good"" stories. Fox news seems to be working hard to annoy people. Not interested. I'm trying to find a good, respectful conservative news source."
"This app is horrible. Constantly crashes. UI is ridiculously elementary. They need to keep up with the demands of the tech savvy, new generation. Also, it barely loads a story or clip without bombing and crashing immediately. Worst. App. Ever. Also, the app is asking for WAAAAY too much personal info. Why do they need access to my photos, media, mic, and video calls? Like...why are you collecting so much of my private information?"
"It's probably one of the worst apps to come out of fox, and that's coming from someone who watches the actual news channel in the mornings. I got this to help out on days I'm a bit late to work and need to catch up on the news. It's constantly glitching and I get random pop-ups and adds to the point it not only crashed the app but I had to reset my phone!"
"My goodness, this app was a tremendous disappointment. I was eager to get my news on the go but lo-and-behold, it crashes basically every 15 seconds. I can't even click on a single article! It also caused the rest of my phone to act weird; my battery began to drain rapidly and other apps began crashing. Definitely do NOT recommend."
"Extremely disappointing and honestly? Very creepy. I downloaded the app so I would be able to keep track with what's going on with the world on the go but immediately after downloading it, and opening the app, I knew I wouldnt be able to do that. The app is extremely glitchy and froze on ""america is watching"" for a solid 3 min, then I had problems downloading anything else because the app took up so much space on my phone! And it slowed everything down as well- I had to delete to fix my phone"
"I thought I'd be getting quick, up to date news from this app but most of the stories I was looking for weren't anywhere to be found. Maybe the UI is to difficult to use. The developers need to remember their audience is likely unfamiliar with modern technology and completely out of date, just like this app actually. If you have to look for a feature, the UX is not correct. Design for your dumbest user, likely Donald Trump for example."
"Since the update, the broadcast ends at each segment, and does not go to ads, attempt to begin and it every ad available, click on the listen again and select, and it's halfway through the next segment. Have tried clearing data and cache, Uninstalled, restarted my phone, still same issue. Tried under wifi and mobile. No resolution. I use the app in the car so can't play around with it driving down the road."
"Too many alerts! Breaking news, and or news alerts should be reserved for just that. Not for trivial political headlines of the day. Is so frustrating to get an alert that's absolutely a waste of my time. In addition when there is an alert of a story I like to read, when I click on the notification it takes me directly to the homepage not to the actual story. I do watch your channel and I am a conservative however, your app needs a lot of work to be something I use for breaking news."
"App doesn't even open. It's very buggy, it bogs down the phone, and eats up my battery life. The format is not user friendly, and it glitches when I try to navigate the app. It's slowing down my phone, and the app crashes. I've had to restart my phone several times since downloading. Would not reccomended. Steer clear."
"I pay to be bombarded with commercials!! The commercials are out of control! The app often freezes and signs you out. When you sign back in full episodes are black screen only. Uninstaller and reinstall the app fixes this for about a month, then it is right back to freezing and auto signing you out. Come on Fox.....make the app as great as the channel!! Cut down the commercials, allow FF/Rew without having to sit through the same commercial again!! Show some pride!!!! Seriously!!"
The app has become slow and jumps. The worse is trying to read an article in their bussiness format. Slow to load and It will jump on screen. Many obstructive ads. It has gotten to the point that it looks like you get 15 ads for an article. I now skip news when they use business format. Not to mention that it's getting worse about useless news. Many news articles on the same topic one after the other repeating the same issue. The sports section is like reading political news. Deceptive ads.
"I thought all the bad reviews were exaggerated on how laggy this is until I got it, I couldn't believe it! Everytime I tried to click on a story it got very laggy, and it crashed my phone every few days. Also I got many ads, more than I'm pretty sure I should have gotten. I'm not sure if it's just my phone but it also seemed to drain my battery faster. The news also seemed biased as they seemed to keep to one side of the story and ignored the other side."
"Terrible app. The app runs extremely slow in general. I just want to look at some news for my area but I can't find it with the layout. It's so confusing! For you doesn't have anything for me! It's also extremely laggy most clicks won't register on the app. There's an hour of my life I'm never getting back, on my death bed I'll say, ""I could've lived long, but the damned Fox news app took all my time away..."""
"What happened in the last couple weeks?! I like this app, but as others have said, the unavoidable, creepy forced sound ads from China are causing me to no longer use this app. Plus, I don't want to see the ads with violence and sexual promiscuity in them. Such a shame. Clean up the ads and this app will be usable again. Let me know when you have made the changes, Fox News. Edited: Adding that now the app plays an R&B song for about 10 seconds, randomly, every once in a while. So annoying!"
"Right off the bat the layout really caught my attention, well once I could actually get into the bug filled app. The setup is flat out confusing and borderline unusable, I'm not sure who approved it. Now to get to the bugs, the biggest problem I had was the constant freezing and page jumping. It was ridiculous."
"When I downloaded this app I thought that I was going to be watching the news right away but as soon as it opened I tried to get my code but it sent too late. This app beeds to get fixes again because it is very glitchy and has a lot of bugs. Trashy app, would not recommend at all! Terrible job trying to fix the bugs, which weren't fix clearly. Overall just horrible experience. Thumbs down."
"8/15 Last update is a disaster! When trying to view individual news items, after leaving the home page, scrolling down is messed up. When I touch the screen to try to scroll down, the page just pops up to the top of the page, repeatedly! To scroll down I have to use two fingers, one to hold the screen in place while the second finger scrolls down. 8/29 Two weeks later and this problem is still not fixed."
"The app is impossible to use. It takes centuries to load, is very glitchy, and has bias and inaccurate news. The moment I open it, my batter starts drain 4x as fast as it usually does. I also had to restart my phone at least 3 time because it was slowing down my phone and making my phone not work at all. When the app finally loaded after waiting more than 5 minutes, when trying to click on a video to watch, it had an everlasting loading screen and I never even got to watch it. Very disappointed."
"This app is terrible. I seriously expected better since its Fox. When I first opened the app, it started glitching so much I couldn't even click anything. I had to turn my phone off and turn it back on to even get back to my home screen. I uninstalled it and installed it again, but then it got 2x worse!! The screen kept turning white and nothing would load for like 30 minutes!! I also tried writing to the developers but it's been well over 3 weeks and nothing. Waste of time..."
I liked the colors and the layout. I just wish it would load anything. It wasn't the wifi either. It just kept crashing. Very buggy. It's something I would expect out of CNN but not fox news. I'm VERY disappointed. I was hoping to get more new alot quicker as I am not home alot.
Knowing what is happening in the world is very important. Using this app will not let you get true facts about many things. The information doesn't match what is actually happening. There are also a couple bugs that make this app difficult to use such as closing the app when I opening it. The screen also freezes a lot. I recommend not using this app.
I was super disappointed when I downloaded this app. I was expecting to get the news but all I received was a glitchy app. The app only showed me news that would gloss over super important topics. It also was super biased against different races and cultures especially when addressing the BLM movement. The news wasn't accurate to what was really happening and to me it was like a form of entertainment. The language that they use when describing different people is completely unacceptable.
"I was looking forward to having a new news source available to me but the experience i had on this app was horrendous. It drained my battery, kept shutting down and overall has so many glitched and bugs. There were also many many annoying ads. It was a truly terrible experience I would not recommend this app at all. DO NOT GET THIS APP."
"This application look like it was made by children. As soon as I open up the app, there's a blank screen. Its like its frozen. Nothing would pop up until I had to delete the app and re-download it. Although this time the were more ads than news articles. When I try to find an article, I click on it and it takes to yet again......a blank white screen. This is so unacceptable."
"Be careful with synchronyzing all your saved files across your devices. This feature doesn't work very well and you lose all your comments and markings on your files, especially when you decide to click on the SHARE function. Nothing will be saved except the original, unmarked file. Not very good when you want to share comments with coworkers or as a backup copy. It happened to me so many timesð¡ð¡ð¡ most of time it doesn't work!!!!!"
"The app is unusable. When you open a PDF, a giant pop-up window asking you if you want to use liquid mode blocks you from reading your file. There's no option to get rid of the pop-up unless you agree to use liquid mode. You simply have to wait 5 minutes for the pop-up to go away before you can actually use the app to read a document. I switched to using OneDrive to open PDFs because it allows me to actually read the files."
"Don't buy this service because when it fails you in a pinch they will not reimburse you. I wanted to remove two letters to correct a typo, that is all, but I can't even do that. I tried deleting the two letters but the app for some reason wants to edit the entire page. When it does this it jumbles all of the words on the page. I tried inserting a small white image to cover up the two letters, but every time I insert an image, it doesn't appear! My deadline is past, and I only want my money back."
"This app is barely functional. I think half the recent downloads are from people like me who re-download once or twice a year thinking it would work. The edited text doesn't save, it won't open most PDF's I need it to with no explanation, and most of the functions don't work, at least not on mobile. One of these days, I'll stop trying this thing that appears to have been forgotten about by the developers."
I tested the premium for 2 days. It just works so bad... Everything works in the cloud which makes a simple combine PDF to take 30 minutes and 2GB of data... Then the document gives you error when you try to open it. If it is not damaged takes between 7-8 min to open. You want to rotate the pages and there is no option to select all. You need to go one by one!!! In a 200 page document... Incredible they want to charge 10$/month for this. What a steal!!
"The new search functions is awful and utterly useless. I need to search a long complicated document, on a regular basis. I need an overview of all occurrences of my search term, as it was in previous versions. Having to go through each individual hit, as it is now, is completely unacceptable and unusable. Switch it back or I will be forced to find a way to get sideload a bootleg of an older version . That search feature is more important to me than any so-called improvements you could ever make. Also, I will NOT log in to a stupid pdf viewer. Very offensive. Stop trying to track people or steal their data. Viewing PDF'S on my phone does not require any internet or cloud access."
"Terrible update! The latest version imposes the 'features' on your reading experience, most notably with the pencil icon that pops up on the screen whether you want it to our not. Also, search now only returns one response at a time, which is useless. I hate updates that make the app worse, not better, without really adding any useful tools or features. I wish there was a way to go back to the earlier version?"
"Couldn't leave well enough alone could you? I need this app for work purposes. It is how we fill out work orders. The latest update has made editing the work order extremely user Unfriendly. When creating new text, you do not have a full screen to see what you are actually typing unless you stretch the text box which makes no sense, just give me back the full text screen. Also if you have to adjust the placement of the text sometimes it jumps around when you try to grab it. ð¤¬ð¤¬. This version sucks"
"This app was great! Was being the operative word. The new UI is terrible and makes it absurdly hard to access the table of contents of a large book, requiring four separate touch inputs which wouldn't be such a bother if it didn't break 90% of the time you tried to use it. But here we are. Get literally any other PDF reader, you'll save yourself a lot of hassle."
"6/21/19 Read rave reviews about new stuff so I did the update. Big mistake. The most useful feature of the version I had was the ability to search a document for a word and have the app show me the number of times the word was used and a small bit of the text at each occurance. This is useful when searching a book doing research for studying or to write a report. The versions since 18.2.0.182935 only highlight each occurance, does not say how many times the word is used, no preview text panel."
"Acrobat used to work flawlessly. Over the past couple of months, it seems that all of the documents I try to open receive an error message saying that ""the document cannot be opened because the file is corrupt"" - even though I am able to use/read/print each document on my other platforms. The documents are fine, and not corrupted. This app was, at one point, a solid app. Now, it's just an annoyance. I have to remind myself that this app doesn't work, and to not attempt to access it. ð¤¦ð¼ââï¸"
"Ok as reader. If you want to author or edit documents, $9.99 gets you the ability to add/edit text. You can also add images. You cannot delete images, or perform some of the edits which are, for me, mission critical. The lack of ability to fully format a pdf document on a chromebook and the like makes this app a waste of almost ten dollars. One can find the same functionality and much more in a free pdf app. Come on, Adobe, you can do better."
"In versions 18.2 and below, users are able to get an overview of word search results and therefore able to jump to the result they need. However, in later versions, users have to sieve through the results one by one. This is obviously a huge disadvantage if searching through large text. I would suggest that the developers include this overview option. Because of this reason, other PDF viewers are more appealing."
"No option to save files? Really? Opened a document directly from an app using Adobe and have absolutely no idea where it is. You have options to rename and delete, share via email or save to cloud, but no option to save or copy to my device? You can locate files but you only give the parent folder so again I have no idea where the file is in my phone if I want to copy it myself. Wow. Basic Forget all the bells and whistles and just give us this basic functionality."
"Frustrating as hell. Can't paste, moving text is extremely unintuitive, can't paste, the keyboard keeps popping up, can't past, I want to throw my phone, can't paste. What the hell happened, the older version was, from what I remember, much much more useful and easy to use. Can't paste in this version. This is frustrating. Have to sign in? Uninstalling..."
"Wow this app is HORRID. The interface makes you fight it for every little edit and change, the bullet point options are black when in dark mode so you can't see them, and the reason why I am deleting it is because it forces you to stay zoomed in on the document when editing. That's right, you cannot zoom out and view a full page at once, you can only zoom out far enough to see the entire width of the page, and no more. Oh, and you can't create a blank PDF. The ""create"" option is for converting"
"Missing text... I edited some resumes and got everything I could edited, given the limited features of the program, and saved them as they appeared fine in the original viewing. As I started to send them to where they needed to be, I noticed the thumbnail looked different. When I opened the documents I found that all of the text I had edited was a blank space!! Hours of work went in to the edits for those resumes just to find out they were ruined because of your program! Worst $10 ever spent!!"
"All you seem to be able to do is make text boxes and add images. It's not even possible to add bullet points from what I can see. The fact that they ask for a subscription for this barely functional app that is only better than Notepad because the text is in boxes. That's it, it's not better formatted, it's literally just in a box. If I could give negative starts for wasting my time I would."
"Beware! Adobe offers a 7 day free trial, but if you decide its not worth the price you may be out of luck. Inside the app itself where it provides a link to manage your subscription, but there is no subscription to cancel. Only after sending an email I was provided with a link to cancel. It appears the strategy is after the free trail you realize canceling isn't an easy option just as Adobe takes $26 out of your pocket. There are better alternatives that are free and not so seedy."
Falsely advertised as free! I just wanted to edit a document. Something that would have taken 5 seconds to do. A service that's FREE everywhere else. But they wanted me to subscribe monthly or yearly for a STUPID amount of money for what it is. I guess I wasted the amount of time I could have just done it on my PC with an actually free program. Would be nice to do it on my phone. It could save me a whole 60 seconds. Not worth $100. Not even worth $1. Lol But Adobe did waste my time though.
"One star is a bit too much of a rating for this non working app. Total junk, whenever attempting to open any pdf documents, it says document corrupted or damaged. Google docs open those same PDFs without a problem. Sad to see a company whose own software is unable to open its own files. Yet the keep on pushing ads to upgrade to a paid version. Uninstall this junk, I guess I had hopes over last two years of updates that it'll work eventually, but that never happened."
"I wanted to simply open a pdf in the app and view it. Sounds simple, right? No. The app forced me to ""process the file through the cloud"" and then automatically displayed the file with some odd outline view that does not resemble at all what the document looks like on a PC (the app even changed the fonts!!!). After sifting through the numerous tabs and pages, I found it impossible to make the app do this fundamental task. **Rolls eyes**... this is definitely an adobe product..."
"This used to be a great app. I use pdfs for work order check lists, and size 8 font with double vertical spacing worked great, now it's misaligned and skews slightly upward with every entry. i use it in portrait and continuous mode more often than not, and it's maddening to have it reset to landscape AND PAGE VIEW every time i close the program. I deal with anywhere from 50 to 350 line items and I can't always keep the app open, and would enjoy being able to set my preference on how it reopens"
"On most files/downloads that I try to open, it will go to a black blank screen. Never opens as the page that was in the download. This is on my Samsung Note 9. I am about to dump Adobe and try another that will actually work. Has been for several months. Have uninstalled and reinstalled in case something had been corrupted with no improvement. Can't find any help page and tired of it. Now, when I get a pdf, it will only open to my printer's print page. Not as a document that can be read."
"Why do all pictures show on black and white?!?! There are no settings in app to toggle. Is this just how this app works?! This isn't new either. Been ongoing for 2 years at least. One day it just went from color to B&W. If you can't help me fix this or patch it, I'll need to use a different pdf reader. If I need to pay a subscription to get color, that won't happen. Just saying."
"Garbage app. The mechanics are clunky and the options are limited. You can't even change a file name in the app. The best you can do is save a copy then hunt the file down in your phone's internal folders (if you can even find where it saved it - you can't control that either!) and then rename it. It's not worth a single penny, much less $70 dollars a year. Edit: Thanks for responding, dev, but that didn't work. I don't see the option to rename an existing file anywhere on the app."
"Adobe pushed Photoshop ad in my app list. I'm not sure how they managed to do it, but every time I click on an image, I get Photoshop (Install) as an option to open the file. I had to uninstall Acrobat to make it go away. Adobe, stop messing with Android's loopholes. I've filed a bug report with Google for your underhanded attempt at ""advertising""."
"This app saves local versions of files in a hidden folder only it can access, bloating its size. Those files are only removable from within the app itself, not with a file explorer. Even if your file is saved on an SD card originally, Adobe still makes a new version inside its own app in an attempt to get the user to start using their cloud services so that they can manage their files."
SOME FREE TRIAL!!!! The free version WAS a great viewing and editing app. I subscribed to the free 7 day trial of the upgrade and 2 or 3 days in I was charged for the subscription. This to me is ripping people off! Very sad way to get money. Don't say it's a free trial if you're gonna take money from my card. TOO many scammers out there. Now I have to take my payment card off of here. Thanks! (Not to mention it was a pain to edit with)
"I want to use this app & I have an Adobe Acrobat Pro DC account (~$30 monthly). It is basically unusable though. I use a stylus to take notes and annotate PDFs. When in draw mode on the Adobe app you cannot scroll down in the PDF without exiting the annotate mode. Contra, for example, the XODO app - there, you can write with the stylus and scroll with your finger. App is also pretty limited on annotation ability. Final gripe - no OCR. Love the PC product. Android version is bad."
"When I opt to select a PDF that's already on my device, I expect a file browser, not a giant flat list of everything everywhere sorted by folder name (without regard to folder location). Absolutely the most useless ""local files"" selection setup I've ever seen. Can't really evaluate the reader further as I couldn't find everything I wanted to check!"
"I have been using this app on my Chromebook for over a year now. Recently, it has stopped working. It won't allow me to open my PDFs. Tried un-installing and re-installing, but the problem is still there. Only way to open up PDFs is to first open this app, then search for my file to open...which is the opposite of what I want to do, and takes way more effort that just double-clicking the file. I did nejoy this when it was working..."
"I keep getting the same air on android S20 ultra: ""Unable to access file. Make the file name shorter."" It was working fine and then all the sudden a year after getting this phone I started getting the error message making the app completely unusable. There are no suitable online solutions found and Adobe does not provide any support options for free apps. Why would I ever buy a premium app if your reader won't even work, and you won't support it. Worthless app. Don't waste your time or money."
"I rarely use this all. Today I needed to use it and it had to to update. When it updated and I opened it, a screen opened a page for me to re register using my credit card for verification saying I wouldn't be charged. I put in all the information. It was NOT anything to do with the app at all. Instead it was to sign up for some streaming service and said after 5 days it would charge $39. VERY deceitful as it presents as the pdf app when it was for an extensive advertisement. I am pissed!!!!"
"This app was everything I looked for in a PDF reader, until the update. Now it's ugly, clunky, awkward, unintuitive, lacking in options to fix these unwanted changes, and a overall pain to use- to the point I'm uninstalling it immediately and finding something I can work with. Offer your customers choices instead of forcing them to suffer changes, or else you'll lose out on customers."
"The most recent update has changed the layout so that noting documents has gotten complex and removed the ability to sign documents easily from a simple single button on screen. It is now hidden behind 4 submenus. Also the instructions on the Adobe website still refer to the old version and are not current with the latest version. Had to downgrade to the older 10.2 version, available on APKMirror to restore functionality."
Update ruined my life. I can't highlight my pdfs and save the highlights anymore. There is some God awful file management mess you have now. If I try to open a file from local it opens read only. You have dropbox integration but when files save the highlights won't open in any other device or platform. Really ruined my semester thanks a lot. Hope I can find another way to read my research articles and highlight them. Monopoly.
"Adobe changed this product so much that it's made me magnitudes less productive than ever. None of the functions are where they used to be. It's bad enough I have to hunt-n-peck when typing, now I have to hunt-n-peck the app just to find the features I used to use with keyboard shortcuts. Now to get the features it used to have they're charging a monthly fee. That's just crazy!"
"It isn't Flash, so I expected a terrible excuse for an Adobe product that was not worth giving a chance. Spoiler alert: I was right. Not only does it have all the same limits and features as the more typical generic PDF viewer most phones and PCs have, but it goes out of its way to prove once again that Flash is the only good product Adobe had, ever had and ever will have, just like the rest of the company's ""services""."
"so, i go to start my 7 day trial and after severl unsuccessful attempts at starting a FREE trial, my conclusion is that the ""Trial"" sign-up checks to see if it can successfully charge whatever you've entered as a form of payment. When you enter your card number, that number should not be checked until AFTER the trial period is up. Fix this its broken. Also, app saves everything you put into the subscription areas. It doesnt get rid of them, even if you clear data/cache. Dangerous. DO NOT USE."
"App wont even open. I downloaded pdf file and I couldn't even tell you what this app does because I cannot get past the log in screen I tried clearing the apps data (which there should be none if I have never been able to open the app on my phone??) That did absolutely nothing, restarted my phone.. nothing, it's just extremely frustrating to me that every other adobe app at least attempts to function properly. They don't work 100% but at least they can get past the splash screen. Come on"
Pretty worthless app. Can't save a copy of a PDF to the device. Save a copy says it downloaded and it's available but cannot be seen anywhere in the file system to be opened! Seems like the company has known about this problem for a long time and it seems like the product is incompatible with latest model Samsung phones. None of their suggested fixes work. I encounter the same problem when trying to print a PDF to a PDF file from an open PDF. Cannot find printed file anywhere in file system.
"what a POS. you can't save, rename or do anything locally. tons of better features can be found in other pdf products. adobe is overpriced, crashes too often, and saving files?? damn, near impossible. gotta rename the file outside of the app, then locate it to edit, and save a copy. and no,i dint want to use your stupid cloud to do anything. it's absolute junk."
"The reason for my one star is very simple. When using this app on the galaxy tab s4 I noticed when you jump from one section to the next using the bookmarks (chapter 1, chapter 2, etc.) The app completely freezes. After a while, I noticed that if I instead of jumping around scrolled to the desired page this didn't happen. But, when reading a pdf with 500+ pages this is not convenient. It seems that the reader renders the pdf as you go along, and if you say go to a other section and then back, it completely forgets it already rendered that section. This is an easy fix, not sure why it was implemented in this way in the first place. Will change review once fixed."
Very poor experience. I use this app primarily to print out sewing patterns from my android phone. Most patterns come with layers so only one size can be printed to save on ink and paper. It's not available for this app unless i buy a subscription! I feel like i am being nickle and dimed to death with all the features on multiple apps being only available with a subscription. I don't have that kind of money to spare. OH! Forget about being able to print to scale. I've wasted so much ink...
I hate the constant reoccurring prompt for liquid reader. It's sketchy to send the files I'm viewing directly to adobe. I know it's part of their privacy policy but I don't want Adobe to profit from my data for a feature I never actually want to use. I just accidentally tap on it trying to make it go away. Malicious design. I Uninstalled it and I moved to an open source alternative.
Signed up for the free trial and forgot to cancel before the 2 weeks was up. I was charged 20.00 each month a couple months until I realized. But then today I made it a point to cancel my subscription and they charged me 99.99 to cancel. Never would have gotten excited about the free trial. Most expensive free trial I've ever had. Thanks Adobe!!
"Super frustrating, I'm attempting to fill in a check list for work using a fillable PDF and the words are getting cut off but I cant find anyway to adjust the size of the font. It should be a basic feature but for some reason they've either pay locked it, though when I signed up for the free trial of pro it didn't get better, or they've just not made font size adjustment a feature. This shouldn't be this hard. The app is totally fine if you want to view a PDF but not actually use it"
"Was charged for a subscription I had canceled beforefree trial was up. 69.99 was removed fro. My bank and it is virtually IMPOSSIBLE to reach anyone that can help me with this. Galaxy Store was where it was originally downloaded but I've yet to receive an email, much less a call from them and this has been spook frustrating cause that money is needed and not a soul seems to care. Beware of this ""free trial"", as there're many great converters online that are free out right. Trial or not."
"Adobe Document Cloud makes it incredibly difficult to find, save, and upload documents to my device, drives, and emails. I'm not terrible with technology, but it took me 30+ minutes to finally get a copy of a PDF saved to my computer that didn't require a sign in so I could send it via email. Absolutely ridiculous. It also makes no sense that sometimes I am able to edit the documents, while other times it says I need to get a subscription, so this app it driving me nuts."
"Everything is behind a pay wall. Can't even turn a pdf into a jpg without starting the free trial. After which they charge you. Would not recommend at all. Not simple to use and not user friendly. Honestly, I'm not even sure what you CAN do in this app without paying. Seems all functions are locked behind a pay wall just about."
"Not what I expected. I was hoping to be able to edit an old contract for my brother's business that he had stored on his computer, scanned in pdf format. However, when I attempted to select an area, for example, just the date on the first line, it selected the entire page instead. There was no way to select only one part to edit it. I even tried using the search function, which couldn't even find the month on that first line. Maybe it's just not compatible for my Samsung S7 tablet?"
"App is totally useless! I can't read anything that is opened with this app. Cuts off half of the documents so I can't see the right side of it. So I end up downloading the pdf and using Microsoft Office to read the document. I've done everything in settings to try and fix, even Uninstall and reinstall. Nothing works, useless. Adobe used to be the best, what happened?"
This is more about their business model than it is their product. I ran into technical difficulties while setting up an account through Google play. I eventually gave up and tried to cancel on the app and it redirect me to Google subscriptions which said I didn't have one so I chalked it up to technical difficulties. Turns out they have been charging me 16.99 for the past 2 months and when I went to cancel on their actual website they charged me a $30 early cancellation fee. Honestly screw them.
"This app used to be my go to for reading pdf ebooks. But I've had to delete it because it held my files hostage and many of the features it had in the past are no longer available. Some books I downloaded were routed to the adobe reader downloads folder...which does not allow access through android's file explorer. The files are hidden! Also, you cannot delete those files unless you delete the app. It's some kind of marketing ploy to get you to subscribe to their cloud rubbish. Deleted!"
"I loved Acrobat. They changed the full free Acrobat to just the reader under the same app (on store) to keep the reviews. Doing this is shady to begin with, but it really messed up my phone. It took me over an hour to fix. I actually had to delete all data, uninstall, restart, reinstall, log in using Adobe Scan, then start this app. (It wasn't loading at all even after deleting data.) Then they want $10/month for what was free a week ago in the middle of a pandemic."
"Worst software company ever. Yearly fee for less than yearly use for product. I need to export one word document and the cheapest billing choice is a yearly subscription of 25 bucks. If I only use the product once a year, I should be able to pay for a smaller amount if time. I am sick of the subscription software. Bring back pay for the license. I'd be happy with an older version of Adobe that exports to Word."
"This app is utterly useless unless paid for. Every conceivable thing you might wish to do is locked behind a paywall with Adobe's app. Even worse, you are not even given the option of saving to your local documents on your phone. Oh no, that would leave too much control in YOUR (the user's) hands. You HAVE to save to Adobe's own cloud. Nor can you rename your files either. Because of the lack of features, and what little they do offer being locked behind a paywall, move on to a superior app."
"Since the new update, I experienced lag time and total stoppage. When I start to use it, it will freeze and then give me error messages that it has stopped working. This is normally a very reliable app. But something is wrong. I am using a Samsung Tab and a Samsung 9 and it is happening to both androids."
Won't let me save my pdf to files on a chromebook. Also won't let me select a signature to move it slightly so that it sits neatly on the line. You just have to keep clicking over and over and over until you HAPPEN to get lucky and have it in the right spot (because the dialogue box doesn't pop up right where you clicked either). Will let me do everything but the two VERY BASIC things I need it to do. Beyond frustrated with this thing right now.
"Whatever Adobe mobile used to be is now garbage. Forget about quick and easy editing like it used to be. Forget about stable platforms and controllable text boxes that reshape and move on the page when and where you want it. Forget about an intuitive UI that allowed for freedom to edit anywhere on a page. Nah, Adobe hated being good, maybe even perfect. They prefer to be mediocre and pesky and downright intolerable instead. Uninstalled."
"Need an option to Preset Defaults... All my pdf loads in landscape view and I'ld have to rotate my phone back and forth each time to get it up right. I also preferred the Continous Page as opposed to Page-by-Page. I open up a lot of PDFs daily at work and on the move and overtime this gets repetitive and annoying. You need to offer users an options to set and lock loading preferences or I will find an app to replace this ""New User Experience"""
"I've used this app almost daily for years in my career, but after a recent update Ive chosen to move on. All PDFs will only show headers and page numbers now. It's not the PDF file itself because I can open them just fine in other viewer apps and on my PC. Adobe did something wrong with the latest update and the app is completely useless now. Farewell Adobe."
"What the heck happened??? It's a pain just to rotate it; I have to whack my phone. It keeps switching back to default settings every time I close it. The text feature is all glitchy. This was before the last cursed update, thee most used app in my office I'm going to look for something else."
"Couldn't even get the app open. Took what seemed like a really long time to open, so i unistalled and reinstalled the app. Again, nothing was loading, so I force closed the app, got a stop watch, and reopened the app. Three time in a row it didn't load at all. One time I let it go and it hit 8 minutes of sitting on the black opening screen reading ""Adobe Acrobat Reader"" before finally giving up and writing this review. 5 minutes later now, it's still on that screen."
"I have never succeeded in convincing this app to print anything and I have wasted a lot of effort trying. The last time I tried, it said that the feature has discontinued. They discontinued...printing? What else would I want this for? There is not even an option to print attachments or layers (which are the only two features I actually wanted, since I can print a pdf from my browser). Google and Adobe need to get their act together. This is garbage."
"I have always loved the Adobe software/apps but currently this is unusable. Since the most recent update, all new PDF files I open open up completely blank. Past PDF files open fine. Using a different app confirms it's not the files themselves. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and still, no good. Very frustrating."
"I'm on Galaxy Note 9 and can't open any .pdf files on my phone without receiving an error message. Message states ""The file could not be downloaded. Please save the file to your local storage and then try to open it."" I've tried everything and can't get around the error. Tried opening and/or saving .pdfs  from my apps, email, etc. I can't get my computer out all the time to try and view .pdf files. Please help!"
"Totally useless, and even dangerous, as related to job security. Full page ads pop up every once in a while, which is only inconvenient when I'm reading a book, but I tried to use this app to read music charts on the bandstand during live performances and the ads got me completely lost."
"App used to work quite well. Opened pdfs with only a 1-2 second load time. Ever since it updated automatically yesterday, every pdf, even ones it used to open quickly, now takes a minimum of 1.5-2 minutes to open. If you only need to open one, not a big deal. If you need to flip back and forth between 10-20 over and over again, it makes it completely unusable."
Adobe. You are maliciously money grabbing. You opt to automatically charge a yearly membership after a 1 week free trial. I did not even notice I started the trial. I didn't use the app. I quickly requested a refund from the play store and it was automatically rejected. This is very sad. Please refund me. Jamie
"The recent files list is annoying and pointless, and it's a security risk because other people can easily find my confidential information when they use my phone. Please allow it to be switched off or protected by biometrics."
"Why does it have to hide the navigation keys all the damn time? How do you share a screenshot in a review? And why should I? It's just the regular ui but with no navigation keys. The navigation keys do appear when I tap the document, but that just an extra unnecessary step for no reason."
"This PDF is completely useless. I cannot edit or change text boxes within PDFs downloaded. I now have a useless app, not fit for the purpose intended, and it has cost me near Â£70. Do not download. Update: All is resolved as Google play have refunded the amount, though the rating will remain as the app is not fit for purpose and not worthy of any money."
"I am critical of the lack of convenience and simplicity in all technology, but yet, I must use it. This app, like all others, does not give the user the freedom of a pencil or pen, and a blank sheet of paper. (Things technology can't replace...) is"
"""liquid mode"" popups are extremely annoying, and theres no way to prevent it from popping up every time you open a pdf. Update: Adobe, thanks for your response about turning off liquid mode by clicking the water drop icon, but your response misses the point, since there's still no way to prevent the liquid mode popups every time I open a document. It seems kind of gaslighty since lots of people have this complaint, and you repeatedly mischaracterize it."
"Quite possibly the most useless app, continuously crashing, little to no editing options available and the options you do get don't work most of the time. Being charged the same day while they claim there is a ""free"" trial run for the first 7 days. Not to mention when you upload a pdf document to edit it takes forever to upload. Biggest scam and waste of money would not recommend this app to anyone."
"""Billing begins when your free trial ends. Cancel before the free trial ends and you won't be charged."" AND YET the amount was debited from my account and credited to Google Play right away and no refund took place after cancellation. I opted for the free trial to see if Adobe Acrobat could compress my file as much as I wanted it to. It did not get my job done so I cancelled the subscription as I did not require it anymore. Shouldn't the money be refunded?"
"The scanning used to be very good but now it's absolutely bad. You can't even read the lines because they are faded, I pay an annual subscription, and the scanning is very, very bad. I hope Adobe read this msg and give me abit of guidance on what to do as I have cleaned my camera and try to hold my hand very stable but still faded."
"Without a subscription it's absolutely useless. I could use my Cloud storage app to view a pdf if I wanted to (and I do). This thing wants you to sign in so they can bombard you with marketing, and if you want to do ANYTHING that you might download a pdf app for, be prepared for a Â£9 a month fee for a service you'll use once every few months. Doesn't matter if there's a free trial, it's just not worth it."
Can add more than one file at a time to combine files so you have to add one at a time it's insane and the file browsing then use a joke because you can see what's on your device when the shows all the PDF from the whole phone not organized in any way or in any folder confuse the file system browser you can only had one file of time it's kind of a nightmare. Really need to just make it a lot better man
"I downloaded this app with the free trial but realised this wasn't suitable, and within the hour, I cancelled it. I have now been charged Â£19.97 for the first month, and when I went to cancel the account again, I had a message that I would be charged a cancellation fee. I have tried to contact somebody at Adobe to resolve this, but I am unable to at they are closed. Looking at previous ratings, this is a common problem, and trying to contact them via adobe.ly/readercommunity is impossible."
"wonderful feature of liquid mode. But, feeling shy to say that this famous app cannot open all type of files, adjustible reading backgrounds in different colors for reader's comfort, Auto brightness level because phone brightness may be high for reading or sometime low phone brightness might be challenging to read, always on the screen feature, so that we can put our device a bit distance freely and no need to wake screen time to time, in app orientation changing from potrait to landscape."
"Coming from Adobe I expected this app to be the most compatible with all kind of PDF documents, but it seems that if you have a big enough PDF file (Over 1GB and created with Adobe Acrobat DC) then the app will fail to open the file claiming that the file is corrupt. The same file opened with any other PDF viewer works perfectly fine. What a let down."
"The reader opens files, showing a pre-configured template, but fails to display variable, personal data. Other readers are able to open the same file, showing all data. The version in question is 23.3.0.26648"
I would like to give this product 5 stars but because there is no customer service and no way to get ahold of anyone through the app I can't. And because they charge your bank for a renewal the day before they're supposed to. My account was supposed to autorenew on the 17th. I canceled before the 17th and on the 16th my account was charged anyway. I've tried getting in touch to get my money back and no one will help me.
"I mainly use this app to annotate notes & PDF files. It's been the 5th time now that after editing a file, everything I added suddenly gets deleted when I close the app after saving. No idea how to recover the deleted notes. I just wasted hours using this. Addtl: I enabled auto updates but it still wouldn't update on its own. I noticed that not updating immediately cause the app to not save documents. Would be better if we get notified if there is a new update available so I can avoid this."
Won't stop prompting me to write a review so here it is. Too many useless adobe online features pop up when I try to open pdfs which takes extra time and navigating to get past before I can view content. I need an slimmed down pdf reader that just does the basics and doesn't clutter my phones limited screen real estate. Remove the bloat in this app to make it more useable.
"Do not subscribe! Click bait! I am frustrated! I subscribed Adobe which has 7 day free trial, to use the extended version but it doesnt function well on my phone, so I immediately cancel the subscription. However, my card was charged Â£8.99 straight away after I click the 7 day free trial and Google Play refused to refund me! They still charge you even though you have canceled the subscription & the app doesnt work well."
"Every single update this app gets slower and slower. Large (100mb) PDFs take 20+ seconds to open now, searches in large PDFs are glacial to the point of uselessness. Trying to access the ToC is an exercise is pure annoyance and frustration of drill downs and as soon as you choose an entry it promptly closes the ToC and forgets where you were in it... This app used to be decent. Headed for total trash."
I downloaded and paid the $7.00 fee per month (thought it was a free trial) to change a file. But I couldn't erase anything that was originally on the file and replace it with something else. Figured if I paid actual money it would be a useful app. I was entirely wrong. Waste of $7.00 in my opinion.
15/04/23 can't copy text 12/04/23 spam me to review and endless annoying prompts. Old review stands: Won't let you search with spaces searching through the document so if you search for two letters it will only give you every occurrence of those two letters coming together within words- any normal serach function would let you put a space before and after and exclude results that are within words. otherwise generally slow and clunky and impractical always asking for more information about you.
"The app is harassing the user to use the so-called Liquid mode. It sometimes prompts use to enable it, but you can't decline. You either have to enable it always, or every time it prompts you to do it. It's extremely annoying. If I don't want to use it, leave me alone!"
All emails come in French and I have no idea why or how to change it. No other emails come in French and English is set as my only language. The app sends you around in circles and makes it impossible to actually get any help. Terrible app.
"Ridiculous, you changed the way docs are shared, you don't get the document anymore, you get a link...why would you change something that is working well. You started doing things worse since forcing your liquid mode into play, you just remember me of Microsoft trying to push their internet explorer browser on top when in fact the app was rubbish. Please stop doing this and keep things simple. I would give a 5* rating if you get rid of this 2 things. Thanks"
"Everytime I open a PDF, it asks me if I want to use the liquid mode which is very annoying. Especially because there is no ""No"" option. The options are ""Always"" and ""Just Once"". A ""No"" option would have made me happier and a ""Don't show this message again"" would have made me even more happier. The liquid mode sucks and I would be really happy if the app does not ask me every time if I want to use the liquid mode. I would want the app to show PDFs as they are."
"Trying to install this on my new phone to read a pdf. Wont work without login. Wont login with google, none of the codes sent in mail work. Now i am locked out due to multiple failed attempt. A simple task became an ordeal. Uninstalled quickly and picked another app. Bye"
"Literally just changed my password on the app because it wouldn't allow me open my documents with the password I had set, then to change the password write it down on paper to put it in n it's still telling me I can't access it with the password I just changed. Useless app"
Constantly asking me if I want to turn on liquid reading mode is really annoying. You're a PDF viewer! Just open the PDF and do nothing more. Liquid reading mode makes the document harder to view most of the time.
"2 star more so for the trial period not having the reminder fay prior in order to either cancel or continue, I got the remind the day of late in the evening which I actually thought was today early morning, unsubscribed thinking I got it in time - NOPE, money has already been taken out. Not happy about it as money is tight. Now the payment has been taken for a years worth of not using an app."
"Why is the video player changed? It is complete garbage not being able to skip forward or backwards by double tapping the right and left sides of the screen. Even trying to skip using the timeline bar is horrible once it disappears from view, tapping the screen does nothing to bring the video options back. And the most useless part is scrolling up to see more videos that have no relation to what I'm watching. Bring back the original video player, it was perfect."
"app appears fine But the video is displayed when you see the Short Clip page. It has no function of this layout, It disappears from the screen and no toolbar at all. And when you click on the bottomless, it shows nothing but goes to the post and l that. And the recent one was okay Most of the functions vary on the devices you have, Recently, I haven't yet figured out why my tablet was having issues with posting images and image quality around 15:08. 4/10"
Is very buggy to use as well as inconsistent with notifications. posting an image will often result in a layer being added to the bottom of the image cause a very akward appearance. Reports no longer yield any results if ever even getting a response. Basic features such as the dm button continue to disappear or be locked behind paywall subscriptions. Ads are all clearly scam companies for crypto or get rich courses. Each update seems to remove a feature and just replaces it with a new bug.
"*update* Now, it's even worse! After the most recent update, timelines are now split into ""following"" and ""for you"". Horrible app. I am unable to see any pics I post. They are all labeled as ""sensitive content which I have chosen not to see"", but I haven't checked the hide sensitive content box. In fact, I can see everything I tweet on the web with no problems. I've had the issue for over a year, on 2 different devices, and have received no help from Twitter."
"Can't see quote tweets. Likes disappear immediately after liking a post. Get notifications of ""suspicious activity"" and have to reset my password every other day And liking videos while watching videos causes the video to go mute. The Android app has always been pretty bad but it's much worse, and trending down. Update: video playback is still broken. It's changed, and better, but still doesn't work. Video controls completely disappear"
"Out of all the absolutely stupid bugs this app could have, I just experienced the most annoying one. I was scrolling through my timeline and an account had posted a concert video of an artist and my app froze and closed. I thought maybe it was a fluke but after doing the exact same thing and having the app crash every single time, I am almost positive it is the app as I didn't have issues on the website or when I swapped to a list to avoid the video. This platform is falling apart."
"Using this app to broadcast live video was a massive fail. It did not capture or record any audio during my entire broadcast. I triple-checked the Twitter app settings, my phone's app permissions, camera, and network settings, and function-checked my phone's built-in microphone. All were set properly and functioning, yet no audio was recorded. I'm a digital communications professional and this is simply unacceptable."
"Doesn't show my whole feed when I open it I have to click ""show more"" several times and hope it doesn't jump to the start. Can't save a picture half the time cuz it switches to acting like I'm the poster and adding a delete button, making me reload the whole app, then I'll still have to find the post again! Then when trying to save it I have to do it several time cuz it says it failed to save. Never had any of theses problems before on 3rd party Twitter apps."
"The auto refresh when I'm right in the middle of reading a tweet is the WORST feature EVER. Whoever decided to do that should be fired and never decide anything ever again! Over the past 2 months, the app has been so slow to load! Makes the whole experience annoying! I've tried countless things to fix it but nothing is improving."
"The changes made to this app over the last week are incredibly annoying and unnecessary and a waste of everyone's time to have coded and implemented. The constant switching of positions of the reply/like/retweet buttons is confusing and not something that needed any change whatsoever. None of that would have had to change if you didn't put in the views thing. Also the ""for you"" page being automatically set when I open the app is infuriating."
"It's so buggy and clunky now. And the recommended posts aren't pertinent to me or my interests anymore, they're totally random. The volume cuts in and out on videos at will. The newly added ""for you"" section is useless and redundant. The news section hardly shows any current news anymore. The app runs like it's in beta. I hate it."
"worse with every update. changing things that don't need to be changed, moving things that don't need to be moved, adding views to tweets in-feed (unnecessary and cluttered) and now the cherry on top: shoving me into the algorithm-based non-chronological feed *every time i open the app* (or the desktop site) instead of letting me stay chronological. almost as bad as instagram. it becomes more irritating to use by the day."
Video experience has regressed. Before you could open a video and have it open in a mini player so you could scroll the feed more. Now it's replaced so that every video allows you to scroll down for more (maybe this is an experiment that I'm enrolled in I'm not sure). There's also a bug in this new experience - if you tap on the video to remove the scrollbar and tap the video again to bring it back it does nothing. Please go back to the old version :)
"The new update is TERRIBLE! Was it not enough before that you have to add more problems with your new update? I'm having so much problems with videos, no more double click fast-forward/playback, no more autoplay, random video starts playing when I try to go back, I can't see the duration of the video once I tap on the screen and the controls disappear, it's so Annoying! Twitter used to be my favorite app but I can't say the same now. Please GIVE BACK the previous update before this one."
"The new video player s**ks... Controls cannot be shown back after you tap the screen for them to dissappear. When I flick up to close the video, it just shows another random video. This update is terrible and it was the same as the one from a few months ago. Keep the video player same as it always was (before this update)!"
"The last update of the video player made it worse in every possible way. Removed fast forward, can't close a video by flicking up, random unwanted videos appear if you flick up, huge text at the bottom that gets in the way, once the text goes the controls can't be seen but if you touch the wrong place on the screen you can unfollow someone. Worst ""improvement"" I've ever seen #2"
"You can't choose videos from the folders. First of all when you choose to upload a file, all folders in your phone should come up alphabetically, not randomly. In this app all folders doesn't show when you try to upload a file then you click on ""more"" to search your folder, it only gives you images, what about videos? what if someone wanted to upload a short video about something?"
"Your new video player sucks. Why fix something that's not the broken? The previous one works so well. Now video experience is so wonky. Videos don't play smoothly. When you accidentally touch the video while playing everything else is hidden, the seek bar, buttons, texts, and you can't unhide. Bring back the old player."
"Since November last year, I haven't received mention notifications, despite my settings being like everyone else's. 3. Dm issue has been fixed, new messages are showing instead of old, that is the only reason I'm giving a star. That and it's the bare minimum to write a review. In all my years using Twitter, I've never had so many issues in such a short time. Update, updating the app clears drafts, despite not logging out or deleting the app."
"It's mind-blowing how buggy this is for how huge Twitter is. One recent example I came across is when signing in from a new device, it will send you an OTP. So when I did this is said it was sending me a text and listed my cell number. I waited and waited and nothing came through. I opened my email later and noticed they were sent to my email instead. Had it happen with another acct where I had to reset the password cause the code wouldn't send. Intern level bugs that shouldn't have hit prod."
"The UI kept getting worse, it kept refreshing the feeds by itself. The video UI is just copying from reels/tiktok and it's annoying. Because of the extended character limit, it's making twitter a horrible place to read because of the wall of text, it's better when using Twitter thread. The algorithm is becoming more like Instagram, and I don't want another Instagram app."
"Glitchy and difficult to use. Starting a week or so ago, videos on the app wouldn't play correctly, they'd play at double or even triple the speed, sometimes sound would play, sometimes it doesn't. Also, the explore tab is seemingly the randomest tweets with no correlation to any of my interests or any topic that I'm even aware of."
I love twitter and would usually rate it a 5 but this year (its only been 5 months of the year??!) It has crashed for me a lot of times. Like it won't work for days and all of a sudden its fixed. I have no update on my phone nor my app. Fix this. I am so done with my twitter app crashing!
"The user experience just keeps getting worse, every update adds bad features. I can't watch a video, tap the progress bar away, and then skim the video after because they decided it needs to be more like TikTok and allow you to swipe down to an irrelevant video from someone you're not even following. And the ""For You"" tab is now cluttered with people I've never followed, nor would I ever"
"I gave it one star because the newest version changed the font size when you open tweet. Before, the timeline used one font size and when you open the tweet, the font size is increased by one or two, not sure. It was very useful and great for my eyes. Now, there's only one font size, and there is no option to set the default size, which is available on the Twitter web. It's sad to see that developers changed the app for the worse."
"Twitter has audio now. Some weird Windows 95 startup audio when booting it up sometimes and one when refreshing the feed. This would've been fine if the audio didn't play despite my phone audio and volume being COMPLETELY off/silenced. Edit: Deep down in the settings there was a setting. It was not easy to find and it had turned on by itself. On or not, it shouldn't override the phones own volume setting."
"The last update with the video player is trash. Once you tap somewhere on the video,the controls disappers,no fast forwards,you can't even see your current time in the video,huge texts at the bottom of the video blocking one's views,swiping up wouldn't exit the video instead,it brings up another video totally unrelated from what you were watching previously,who told y'all we wanted IG reels/tiktok format? You better bring back the former update. This is rated one star because that's the least."
"it was pretty good before. after elon took over, it's been nothing but trash. the bookmarks are a mess. twitter blue ruined twitter. the videos either keep lagging or just stops in between. there are so many glitches in the timeline. it's so annoying to use twitter right now. id rather not use it that having to bare this trash. fix this asap!!"
"Definitely not the Twitter I used to love. You can't even find any of my 6k friends anymore. Every other post is an ad. And I keep stumbling onto crazy content I'd rather not see and can't seem to control my feed. Features have changed and there are a lot of spoofed accounts, I don't know who to trust. Please go back to the way it was when it really was social."
"The changes made under Elon have been poor. Previously the app was stable, now it's buggy. The main thread was perfect, with an amazing algorithm - now it's not representative of what I enjoy seeing. The changing of the placement of buttons, and introduction of new ones (alongside the view counter) is not what anyone wanted."
"Took a sharp and steep turn for the worse with all the changes melon husk has made. The app feels very artificial and dry with the subscription ""feature"" added. Reply threads are boring and filled with blue checkmarks. The ""For you"" is just a bunch of random unrelated bs. The literal only use for the app anymore is the following tab, which doesn't help me discover new artists as much like I'd used to. I'll stick with finding new artists on tiktok I guess."
Non-stop unnecessary changes for the worse. I've been using the app for a long time and recently new changes come so quickly that I haven't even gotten accustomed to the previous version. It's like the developers are children fiddling with his toy without regards to user experience. Shout-out to the video player turning into TikTok which pushed me over the line
"Every single time I press the tweet button, the app crashes. If I try to ""send feedback"" when that pop up appears, THAT crashes too. This a review is now the only avenue I have to shout out a problem that will most likely go unfixed. I know current ownership is the main issue, but is there anything anyone else at Twitter can do about the fact that pressing the tweet button crashes the Twitter app? I already cleared its cache."
"As others have said, the new video player is horrible. Videos now require one too many touches to start, and the video playback options are a mess. This is the second time this video player pops up, and it's no wonder it was pulled last time."
"The last update on the video player made it worse in every possible way. Removed fast forward, can't close video by flicking up, random unwanted videos appear if ou flick up, huge text at the bottom that gets in the way, the text goes the controls can't be seen. Worst ""improvement"" I've ever seen"
"Fix the video player, why must every company try and simplify the stuff that already works, removed double tap to skip forward, removed the time left, cannot skip forward manually after you minimize the caption for the video. All pointless changes made to try and be like every other social media platform with reels, and shorts"
It's gone from being my favourite app to a glitchy unreliable mess. The android app is clearly getting a lot less love than it's Apple equivalent. Wishing it could just revert back to how it was earlier this year. It's basically unusable right now. Actively looking for alternatives. Which is sad.
"Twitter have been loading too much recently, before you could watch a video, you'd have to wait 30 seconds for loading, and just 1 seconds of the video will play and so on. When you touched the video to hide the text, you cant bring the bar nor the play button... I had never felt annoyed on Twitter like this before.."
"It's been weeks but this app is still slow af. Takes so long just to fully load and view a photo. Videos at less than 10 sec loads for couple of minutes and it's at the lowest quality too. My connection isn't even slow at all, so other apps are working perfectly and smoothly, but not your app. Nope. Really disappointing tbh"
"Horrible experience after the updates. Everything's been buggy about Twitter Blue. I can't subscribe using web, and my Android subscription is not visible. 2 weeks later, still no update from support. I messed around, fixed the issue myself, but no Twitter Blue checkmark now. The app stinks, and the support team stinks even more. Shame how bad it has become."
"Video Player seems broken. When a video is playing and I tap the screen once, the pause button and slider disappear. The only way to bring them back seems to be to close and open the video again. Terribly annoying."
"There are too many problems with the app. It has become impossible to log into the account from the application. It has also become impossible to add a phone number and turn on two-factor authentication. As if all that wasn't enough, it doesn't translate tweets in Korean. The translation part is very bad. you ruined the app! please fix these problems now!"
"every change they made recently are garbage. the ""for you"" layout is not something that works on twitter. its annoying that i have to see tweets that i have no interest in and that my mutuals have not interacted with. the video player is garbage, there's no double tap to rewind anymore and the photos keep bugging."
"I was quite happy using an old version of the app as the UX is terrible now (impossible to work out where you are, what button you've pressed, what you're doing etc, the highlights are backwards & everything is excessively boldened). I updated as I wanted to add another account but it was painful to look at so I reinstalled the old version and now it just wants me to update and I can't install 3rd party apps any more either. Also threads full of ads/spam. Hopefully twitter will just die soon."
"after the update everything scks, every time we play the video and accidentally tap on the screen every button will be hidden and won't show unles you tap the ""back button"" of your phone and the video will go back to start. trying to make the video like reels so when you scroll down there will be suggested useless videos."
"What is going on with the video player?? It simply sucks. You cannot go forward or backwards by double tapping as in the past, which was really useful. It doesn't even work properly, you just have to click back to see the time bar. Please fix this asap."
"I used to rate this app with a five star rating now I'd give it an undeserved one star rating upon the last update , it's like it was meant to make the app worst , video player is so damn bad with canceling fast forwards and backwards double tap option , navigation bar of the video disappearing once you play the video and you can't go backwards or forwards and if you tap on any place in the video couldd stop streaming or unfollow by mistake ... It's really really bad update!!!"
"[UPDATE MAY 23, 2023]: Still is crashing and haven't figured out what's going happening on my Android 9 phone. Tried everything I've found just shy of a complete phone reset. I did realize that I'm not missing it as much as I thought I would though. So that's new. Wondering if someday I'll forget it even existed... Twitter who??? ð¤ [April 30, 2023]: Keeps crashing after update. Reinstall and restart doesn't fix."
"UPDATE 05/09/2023: Twitter cropping is seriously messed up yet again. How could you possibly defend this garbage ""update""? Image posts now take up approximately 70% of my phone screen. The cropping of the images is quite horrible too, you need to click on them to actually see the full image now. This is an absolutely terrible change. Revert it back, there was nothing wrong with how previous images were displayed."
"This application is very bad for Android users. Updates and good features always come to the iPhone first and are delayed for Android, and it may never reach us. The opposite happens with updates and bad features. In addition, they do not fix the problems on Android until after months"
"Taking this from a 5 star to a 1 star review. Love Twitter, but always having trouble posting Tweets on the Android app. Works fine via the web. Also I have two accounts that are attached to my old news sites that I'm unable to access and Twitter support won't let me regain access to them without the old email addresses that I no longer have access to. The only way to regain access to these accounts it seems is via lawsuit or something. Not sure. Frustrating!!"
"Whoever decided to change the Video player is the world's biggest idiot. Earlier when i see a video post, i could just press it and it will automatically play. But now when i press the video post, it just takes me to another screen where i have to press the play button again ð¡ð¡. Also why did you remove fast forward option too. PLEASE DON'T CHANGE SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY PERFECT!"
"App keeps getting worse. I keep seeing irrelevant posts from people I don't follow. I don't see how it makes sense to start seeing similar tweets a person engages in simply because I viewed their profile. I can't click on a video for it to play once. I'd need to click another button to play it, which is inconvenient. It's the same for gifs. I have to click two ""play"" buttons to view a gif. I miss the old Twitter because this one is rubbish at the moment."
Since the last update the video user interface when playing full screen video doesn't appear when you tap the screen ( if you want to advance or go back in a vid). It looks like a shonky version of Tik Tok ð©. Hopefully it'll get resolved soon ð¤ð»
"Obviously you'll try your best to make this app as terrible as possible. Edit 1: Now, the videos are not playing properly. Current video time goes over the total duration, it stutters, video goes fast while the audio is normal etc. Edit 2: The app is becoming more and more like Reddit."
"1. video player is so old-age and not functional 2. twitter is so buggy like you can't search for tweets easily anymore; once i add tweets to bookmarks they don't appear 3. VIDEO PLAYER DOESNT PLAY MKRE THAN 2 VIDEOS WITHOUT LAGGING OR SKIPPING FORWARD. 4. the for you page and following are kinda useless but I'll get used to it 5. the weird stats like views etc present is so annoying, like it'd be nice if it was easily available to check but not in your face all the time"
"It sucks in 2023. Using the app for Twitter Spaces really sucks because Twitter has not updated it and people using android phones have had to roll back to old versions just to get Twitter Spaces to function properly. When you open the app, it goes to ""For You"" showing accounts I blocked. ""Following"" works only slightly better but fails showing tweets in chronological order as it used to. Pinned Lists is the only reason I still use it."
Video player is absolutely awful and always buggy... Controls disappear and won't come back. Can't actually view any of my likes. It says I have thousands but none show up. Support has been absolutely zero help. Plus you can't see anything you're typing when you send someone a tweet.
"Worse social media app ever, allowing only those with ""Twitter blue"" to have 2 factor authentication is infuriating, I have no way to pay for something online, and I specifically had 2 factor authentication on so my account would be less vulnerable to hacking, you can't just simply delete your account instead you have to disable your account and wait, and I don't like the ""for you"" page disturbing things and things I don't like appear on it. I never used the app much in the first place anyway."
"-videos are super laggy and they skip like a 10sec on their own. even when i try to replay the vid, it would skip the same few seconds. despite my connection being v stable, the video would lag there (wont even go past the lag even after i restart my phone) -new update removed twitter emojis so now emojis are according to device emojis which are ugly please bring back my twitter emojis. -videos cannot be escaped by swiping up and down anymore. it just leads to the next video, very inconvenient"
"What happened to the videos again? No speed option anymore + 1 additional step nedded to play the video. Very annoying (we had this some time ago) Why is the app now CLOSING when pressing on the back / left button? It used to go back to the entry page, since a few days it's just closing the app!"
"New video player is terrible. The video didn't play after You click the play button on the thumbnail. You must click the play button again to play the video. Then, when the seek bar disappear, it won't show again. Bring back the older version."
"It takes two full taps to play a video now, the option to pop out a video and continue to read tweets is also gone. You also can't pause a video once the slider disappears. Why try to fix something that was never broken? User experience is now in negative, double digit negative."
"The latest update has removed instant play option. It has become a 2 step process, once you touch the screen the scroll bar vanishes there is no option to bring it back you have to exit and play the whole video again. Then there is no pic on pic option. Also removed double tap to skip 5 seconds is also removed. What's happening.?"
I can't see pictures in DMs and it keeps showing me old messages and not newer ones. I don't have this problem on my older phone (which is also updated to the current app version). GIFs sometimes disappear when I try sending them. (Usually when more than one is sent in a row) I don't get notifications of some replies sometimes and all of my notifications are on.
"Since Elon Musk took over, the app doesn't work as it used to, your feed is full of random stuff, the algorithm is not working properly, the following page is empty, lags, scrolling sometimes brings you back up for no reason. You basically gotta pay to be able to have an alright experience, that is still worse than before. Hopefully a similar app comes out, I'm done with this. Awful."
"With latest update, tweets are missing from the ""Following"" timeline. The ""default to your last timeline"" feature is still broken. Pinned conversations gone. Video playback blurry even if settings are set to high-res. Notifications from the TL continue to be broken. Keep trying twitts."
"The last update for this app ruined it for me. Not being able to track backwards or forwards in a video kills the experience you have to exit the video and then go back in to get your tracking bar back. Also, dragging up or down just a video anymore. Dragging up recommended videos that I don't care to see."
"The app crashes constantly. I purchased a Twitter Blue, but l literally can't post. I'll type a comment or reply & it doesn't upload. Twitter is installed on 2 Android devices, and the result is the same. I've cleared caches & rebooted the app & have finally reached my limit. I have a 3rd device & for some reason, there's no Subscribe tab in Profiles. I want to unsubscribe on the two useless devices, but that tab is missing also. I suspect sabotage."
"The video player has become so damn terrible. It's just crazy. The video controls disappear randomly, with text appearing over the video. Just one of the many many bugs in the app now. How can things get so bad at Twitter? Fix the video player at least!"
Video player experience is soooooo bad now. The button disappears and won't reappear forever. Unless you close and open again. This is 2023 and this is how you implement media player????? Dafuq. And the the trolls are now verified. This app deserves to tank and disappear forever
"New video player is abysmal. The navigation panels cover half the screen and make it all blurry, tapping to hide the UI makes it disappear permanently. They brought it back recently, changed to one star."
"The bot restricts/limits your account for stupid reasons. Appeals dont work. If you try to use the app while you are restricted you will get a very annoying popup whenever you click anything in the app, which means the app is unusable for 7 days. I never get notifications from mentions. The timeline is split into 2 categories. It's horrible, and is actually getting worse with their ""subscribe to get verified"" and their recent update that killed the ""thread"" system. Ads are very annoying."
"Terrible. It consistently crashes when trying to engage and respond to tweets. It used to function much better, but it is so unstable I'm finding that I use it less and less with every passing day. I think that's exactly what the new user really wants. Pro-democracy voices silenced or downgraded by the pro-authoritarianism algorithm."
"After y'all changed the video player thing, everything is soooo laggy. No, not because of my signal it's because of the awful update where when you click the vid the video player disappears and you can't out it back. You try to play a video, it won't play. You try to pause and unpause, it still won't play. Goodness can't i watch my cat videos in peace without having to struggle"
video player is awful. it's like they purposefully removed all of the good features and added some ugly ui on top. you can't skip forward or backwards with a double tap. one tap gets rid of the playback bar/tweet info but there's literally no way to bring it back up without exiting out of the player completely. and if you try to scroll up to get it back it autoplays some random different video. I'm downloading the APK for an old version. juat awful.
"Stupid ui development. Stop messing with your ui if it makes the ux worst. All you need to do is to fix the AUTO REFRESH, don't mess with the ui, legal content, or even NFT profile, IT'S NOT IMPORTANT. It's becoming more and more unusable, how can you think that collapsible navigation bar is a great idea??? Defeating a whole purpose of the navbar itself. Very bad. Zero star at this point smh"
"The video player always buffers, images do not load even though I have a great connection, buttons in video player always malfunction. Im a Samsung user. The app was updated as well, I have restarted my phone as well as clearing cache."
"What is even going on anymore? Topics won't display above random tweets, which makes the timeline feel absolutely chaotic and disorganised. Random refreshes and the same five tweets appearing frequently also make the whole app experience very annoying. Spontaneous, undisclosed changes (like image cropping) feel more like something that should be properly tested beforehand, as well."
"What is going on with this app over the last year. DM's are broken: Can't open images Missing new message notifications Shows old messages as the ""latest"" For You Tab : Stop this. Nobody wants this. Nobody asked for this. Make it a toggle in the settings like it used to be. Put the home button back to the way it was. Who draws these things up honestly. I'm expecting you to get rid of the ability to follow people next so you show me more crypto bros in my timeline."
"This app is always so annoying. The most annoying thing is having to sign in with an account. Whenever I try to sign in, the app doesnât recognize me and I have to create a new account which is also a hectic thing because you have to wait for hours or days to get a verification code on your phone number."
"Constant bugs. I'm constantly being blocked from opening my dms with certain people. It just eternally loads. Usually this issue resolves itself in a few weeks but recently i wasn't able to message 2 of my close friends that i talk to the most on Twitter for 6 whole months, my support tickets never got a reply."
"I noticed that videos were playing automatically and went looking for how to disable that as it's unnecessary data use. Couldn't find a setting to stop autoplay of video, so I have permanently stopped it by uninstalling the app."
"whenever an image is shared in the dms, i click on it and it doesn't get showed. it just shows a camera icon which is cut off, which means I'm unable to see the image, it's not loading for me. please check into it. fix the bugs, don't change things that aren't needed. also the font is very ugly :) get it back to it's previous font too."
"Terrible. Decided to change my date of birth to my correct one as before it was inputted wrongly, right after changing it my account got locked because I'm apparently not over the age of 13 when I'm clearly 18+. I'm struggling to get a hold on twitter customer service so this probably won't be resolved easily. Thanks for the gargabe algorithm"
"Playing a video is a very annoying experience. Cause I would still have to press the play button. And if the button hibernate, the you would cancel the video the play it again."
"I can't update. Literally, I can, but once I did, my DMs won't appear (it's there but it isn't visible) so I can't update it. (P.S. This has been going on since October 2022, and is actually getting very annoying since I can't access new features if I don't update.)"
Constantly breaking. Features both new and old will randomly disappear and reappear. Video will freeze or audio will not play. Privated circle tweets will be unmarked and shown publically to people outside of your circle. Bots and hate speech are totally unregulated. Over all the quality of this app has tanked over the last few months and idk what needs to happen for this to stop
The previous versions were okay. I'm not a fan of the For You tab. Plz make an option to disbale it. And then the topic when i click on them should be able to give me posts about the topic from different users. But i can no longer see anything on the topics section. It used to be on the search bar then below the trends so you just just click on them and see all.
Bird app has never been amazing but since the spaceship guy got bored and couldn't be bothered solving world hunger it's just so bad I'm considering making the permanent switch to Reddit. That's problematic asl. The video player has changed back n forth half a dozen times and this latest one won't even let me like scroll through the video cos it hides the player section of the player. I like reading captions. Now I cannot read captions. This has angered me. Fire the spaceship guy.
"Videos have bugs, and once it's corrupted you can never view it properly again. RTs also kept getting removed, as well as the mentions. Photo dimensions are so weird literally it crops itself and shows as a giant picture. The embed feature changes so often, I hope it stays that when you click the origin account it directs to the post itself, not the account. Now, the emojis are not standardized and I can't find a way to make it like twitter emojis."
"I've decided to leave twitter since I can't regain access to my account. It seems Twitter no longer has any living beings to help in these types of instances. I can say this because I messaged the support team and got an automated reply, to which I replied, to which I've yet to hear anything back. Just another social media giant that will probably fail. Tech support, especially for the users of a platform is essential. Tech support doesn't exist with twitter anymore sadly, bye!!!"
"Buggy. Also, a recent update removed the option to auto-play videos (the in-app video player in general sucks). This wouldn't be a problem if twitter still allowed competing apps, but that support was killed earlier this year."
I'm so disappointed with your latest version. Very lag and takes a lot of time to load before you can view a picture or play a 2mins. video. A big waste of time!
"I'm not able to tweet, retweet like or comment on any post, I'm getting notifications but when click on notifications after a few seconds loading it says something went wrong try again later, so I logged out of my account then try to log in but it says try again later, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it to login but no use. Now I'm not able to log in"
"It used to be clear on the For You page who you didn't follow (it would say something like ""xxxx followed this person"" or ""xxxx liked this"", but now it just puts random people in there without telling you why. I liked being able to see at a glance if it was someone I followed. Still breaking things, I see. Now half the time, the people tagged in photos or on the list of mass replies is just empty."
"After the last few updates, the For You page isn't in chronological order. I refresh the page and get older tweets, how is that even possible? There used to be an option to see tweets in chronological order, but it was removed. How does that make sense?"
"I just updated a few seconds ago and already regret it. The ""for you"" and ""following"" is super annoying and I wish it had the little star back to make it what I want and not accidentally swipe into ""for you"" when trying to get into my profile. It's obnoxious, especially since I tend to only use one hand to scroll my phone. So suddenly, I have to use both hands to avoid unnecessary swiping and get to where I want faster."
"Really went downhill since that fish lipped fascist bought it, just constantly implementing new dumb updates that break something new every time, from thumbnails instead being massively zoomed in to videos playing in double speed and then stopping halfway through there's no end to the possibilities."
"Inconsistent and arbitrary policies, poor log in system (I have to log in 3 times to log in once?), Constantly reports only for logging in. Maybe the Musk-oteer shouldn't have bought it after all. I fail to see the appeal. Uninstalled."
"Let me start by saying SoundCloud is my favorite music platform. I love the range of music and have built a ton of playlists over the years. This app however, is atrocious. It has been for years and somehow only gotten worse. I can't listen to music without it pausing randomly, several times every song. I shouldn't have to go back and reopen the app to get the song to continue playing. If you want to know why SoundCloud has fallen behind the other music platforms, look no further than the app"
"Recently the app has been stopping the music for no reason. I've been getting errors (including ones blaming my internet connection, which has been fine for everything else) as well as it just... Stopping. Sometimes it takes several force closes to get it to start up again. Something's definitely not right."
"Been using this app for a long time, and prefer it over YouTube because of the terrible audio quality of YouTube. but this app isn't good when you can't even listen to music, no music loads, and I know it's SoundCloud, since YouTube the in that draws more data isn't buffering, AT ALL. I've even upgraded so I'm not dealing with adds, I'm not going to keep giving my money to an app that I can't even use. I can't even listen to a single song on repeat without waiting 5 minutes between loads."
"I've used this app as my primary music provider for 6 years. I've subscribed to Soundcloud Go+ for 2. Gradually, over time, it has gotten worse. Have spotty reception and want to play your music? Better wait for your liked Playlist to load; even though it instantly loads with data turned off. Want to listen to that bumping album you saved a year ago? Cross your fingers, because once you click on it there's a high chance it will disappear from being geolocked. Abhorrent service."
"Galaxy note 10+ After the most recent update the app has become unusable. While trying to listen to music the sound will randomly cut out. It will show that it is still playing, but there is no sound. Pausing and unpacking does not work. Have to manually move track one second forward or backward to get it to play again. Clearing cache and data did not help. Neither did unintalling and reinstalling."
This app is really good but whenever I try to use other apps at the same time my music cuts off. Please fix this I've seen so many other people mention this and you haven't even fixed it yet. It's very annoying and makes the SoundCloud experience not enjoyable at all. A year later and this has not changed at all. Please fix this- its very stressful.
"S22 Ultra. The app is currently unusable for me. Yesterday the music suddenly started to cut out. Pause and unpause does nothing. To get it to play I simply have to scroll a second forward in the song. This is a problem, I am always driving when listening and now I have to mess with my phone literally every minute or no music. Clear cache and data did nothing, neither did a reinstall. Speed test consistently 150mbps+. The only thing I can think of is my phone switching between LTE/LTE+/5G/5GUC"
"A super annoying bug that has been happening for the past couple weeks is where a song will end, and it'll try and play an ad, but then it says that something went wrong in the app, and pauses the next song at the very beginning. So it makes me manually press play every single time a new song starts."
"Horrible. I tried canceling using a computer desktop view. In the help section of the website, it provides a cancel subscription link, then reloads cancel subscription add new subscription. A limited bizarre library of songs. I rarely find what I search for... And I'm no amateur.. I work at the public library so it's not user error! I don't understand why it's linked with the djay app when it won't let me actually use any of the music to build a playlist of mixes. It's a rip off without the rip!"
"UPDATE BROKE APP. Randomly pauses music regardless of network strength. Not sure if their servers are complete garbage or there's some kind of caching issue but I can't even use the app anymore because it pauses randomly every couple minutes. Like bare minimum once per song. Some songs are completely unplayable. I've reinstalled and tried on multiple devices, this is entirely SoundCloud being incompetent."
"Despise it so far. Got the app in order to use my phone to play tracks for an ESL course I am teaching. Class was interrupted by a 30-second commercial after every other track. Won't be using the app for anything else given how intrusive the advertising is. And I won't be doing any exploring of other features under those circumstances, so they can forget about me paying for an upgrade! Just awful."
By far 1 of the worst glitchiest music apps I've used up to date. I can be listening to something and it will just do what it wants when it wants. I can be listening to a podcast and it will randomly just switch the episode with no warning. Sometimes it just completely closes out. Not sure if the company is aware of this but it needs to be addressed right away because it's little things like this that kill the vibe and are super frustrating. Update: Found replacement app! This 1 SUCKS!!
"So that update yesterday completely ruined this app's usability. Nothing to do with the interface or the app itself, though. A good three-quarters of all the songs I used to listen to are now only available for Go+ users. I understand that you've got to make money somehow off this website and app; perfectly understandable. However, allowing essentially all songs to be preview-only is not a good move on your part. It was okay that a good portion of mainstream songs were previews, but this? Jesus."
"Any music app that continues to play even after it is closed is an app that must be doing many other things while closed, more than you think. For me, it must turn off when closed and it must be easy to find the ""off"" button. It's also hard to scroll through a song. Things that appear clickable are not. Just not intuitive and not user friendly. I don't like it and when I need it I download, and the delete immediately."
"A large selection of songs. Doesn't have many ads. Some songs require premium to listen to. You can pick which song to listen to, unlike Spotify. Would give a five star rating, but it keeps stopping in the middle of every song. I didn't do anything to cause this. It happens randomly (EDIT: Stops playing after every song now. I have to open my phone after every song just to listen to music. My previous rating was three stars.)"
"Have been using SoundCloud for about 5 years. I love the concept and layout of the app. I have been paying a monthly fee for almost a year now & decided it would be worth paying for a whole year. However as soon as I paid for a year long subscription; my app constantly crashes, I no longer can listen to SoundCloud Go options (even though I'm paying for them), I can't stay logged in on my phone due to constant crashing. I used to absolutely love this app, now I feel like I wasted $72 on garbage."
"Was my go to for recording and storing new music...was so simple and convenient. Now, absolutely will not upload...fails every time. Whether I record in app or in another app and upload, I get the same thing. And it's simply not laid out intuitively anymore. Wanna delete a track you previously uploaded? Dig around and see if you can find it, because I could not. Used to be such a time saver...now it's a complete waste."
"Originally this app was good. It was free and even didn't host ads at first. Everything has changed after the introduction of those ads. The ads themselves were not so intrusive as they are now. They took away the ability to skip ads. And now they have as of lately made it mandatory to watch 2 ads at a time which you, again, cannot skip. This ruins the entire experience and I would never reccomend this anymore."
"This app was absolutely perfect for me! It worked all the time, and I could listen to my favorite music without playing for go+. But today, when I tried to turn the music in my library on, all of the songs that I used to listen to had go + and ONLY go+. I was so confused and sad, because nearby all of my songs weren't allowed to be listened to unless I paid for them. I am truly dissapointed on how all of the good, free songs turned into ones you had to pay for. I would have gave this 5 stars."
"Ever since the update. The track timeline cursor is displayed always at the end on every track even through the song is just starting. If I try to swipe to the beginning or anywhere else on the track, it's still displayed being at the end. Can you SoundCloud guys get anything right? Also still no message feature. Am I in 2009??? This feature should have been in the app years and years ago. Lastly, the ad system now gets stuck/frozen if you're pressing on something as the ad comes up which means I have to close the app and open it again."
"To be honest, I've had lots of difficulty with this app for a while now- but recently, the glitches are just hopeless. Constantly freezing and refusing to play anything, as well as pinning a player in my notifications that can't be removed without force-stopping the app... I'm getting very tired of this, I might just start using the browser version, or youtube."
"It gets one star for being free. For a name as well known as SoundCloud it's incredible how little thought went into the user interface and functionality. I find that my podcasts skip, fast-forward, restart, or turn off sporadically due to app failure. Rewinding the podcast back 10 seconds to relive a good laugh is a nightmare with the sliding track feature because the time increments are indistinguishable. It would take a lot of fixes to make this app great. I'd avoid at all cost if possible."
"I used the Soundcloud app to record presentations and it was perfect. Even when my phone went into standby, it kept recording. Now, after an update, it won't record anymore when in standby. And I can't keep poking my phone during my presentations. Very annoying and inconvient. And the app will not allow me to record in a different app and upload the recording."
"I work in a call center and have to pause this app frequently. When I go back to the app, the song finishes playing fine. The problem is the ad that inevitably follows every song I pause. They start out playing fine, but after about a second, just explode into full volume deafening static in just the left headphone. The only way to stop this is to force close the app. Letting the ad timer run out does not stop the static sound or start a new sound. App is unusable until this is fixed."
"it is very good. the ads however are a bit excessive. gives you great recommendations based on what you listen to. only thing I could complain about is sometimes the song says it is playing but there's no audio. but I exit out of the app and go back in and it does just fine. only that glitch should be fixed but nothing else to complain about. edit: the ads were almost nothing when i first downloaded the app, now they're literally every song."
"Static/popping noise that has yet to be fixed makes this app useless. I used to use SoundCloud on a daily basis, but now have resorted to other streaming services. The static playback has been an issue for close to a year now and I keep hoping it will be fixed, but it's safe to say that I've completely given up on the SoundCloud."
"The community and selection of tracks is great, but the ads have gotten out of control. I am not going to listen to back-to-back unskippable 30 second ads nor will I watch VIDEO ADS on a music streaming app. Not to mention you cant even use the app when an ad is playing to queue music. They also have advertisements appear more often when you skip a song externally, like on your car's dashboard, which I know is 100% intentional bc that way you cant close and reopen the app to skip it. Ridiculous."
"This app used to be amazing. I used to enjoy using it and recommending it to friends, but I dislike it and will never recommend it again. Unskippable Ads after literally every 1 or 2 songs, and they're two 30 second ads, but if you're lucky, it'll only be one 30 second ad or two 15 second ads after every two songs, which is stupid and annoying because it was NEVER like that ð I get that it's to help artists, but come on, really? 20 minutes on Soundcloud and 8+ minutes were ads. TrashCloud."
"Can't back out of the ads at the end of songs, can't pause them from your home screen, and can't skip them; fortunately, there was one way that I found to stop the ad without having to watch the entire thing: uninstalling the app. Hearing one of those unavoidable ads finally cut off halfway was the one good part of this awful experience. Thanks for autoplaying mouth ASMR while I'm trying to listen to music, which Spotify has never done to me; I'd rather support artists with any better platform"
"Finding music is no problem, but being with soundcloud before they actually had real music to now, leaves much to be desired as a free music source. When on a song if you swipe left or right it doesn't always move to the next song and bugs out. What a basic feature that doesn't work most of the time. This app just has a bunch of little annoying issues that the devs can fix but because they don't need to, they wont. The app has gone down hill for the 7+ years I have used it."
Huge performance issues that drain battery. Using battery saver the songs will crash and freeze almost constantly making using it nearly pointless. Riddled with ads and promos to buy the pro version. Also listens to you while closed and open. I work with people that speak Spanish and all of a sudden I started getting ads in Spanish. If I could go elsewhere I wouldn't use this. Over a year and still just as bad. Cannot fathom why you can't filter out reposts on the stream yet.
"After being a user for a year and a couple months I can say there are better platforms to hearing music. The algorithm of music is extremely horrible, some music says ""not available in your country"", and horrible playlist recommendations. I pay for soundcloud go but am thinking of switching. It has a lot of problems that need to be fixed. Definitely will be switching soon."
"This used to be my favorite app. There is a ton of diversity in the music available, and the user-oriented posting allows a lot of underground artists to shine. My issue is that my account randomly got deleted with no warning or anything with THOUSANDS of songs on about 12 different compiled playlists that took me years to put together. No clue as to why or how this happened, I reached out to support and still have head nothing. DO NOT RECOMMEND."
"Awful. I pay for a premium membership and frankly the experience has been extremely disappointing. The music doesn't restart when the phone pairs with my car, which it does with any other streaming app, every time they fix one bug they introduce others, access to reposts has been hidden deeper in the menu making it less convenient. Really disappointing."
For those of you who would like to be able to download music files off SoundCloud WITHOUT paying for the app just login on a laptop or desktop. Pretty sure you can use Chrome and just go to settings and switch to desktop version and download files that way. You won't have to go through the app to listen either use whatever music player ya want. Update: The last few months (possibly longer) the app constantly stops playing while using other apps. About to uninstall if not fixed what good is it?
"It used to work really well and I loved it. There would be no problems even with poor connections, but after a few updates, it starts lagging/crashing. I can't listen to music when I lock my phone because the music will stop and it will not play until my phone is unlocked. I listen to soundcloud when I drive and to keep unlocking it on the road to listen to music is very dangerous. Please fix it"
"I don't know how it's possible but every single update seems to either do nothing or make the app worse. After playing a few songs, I always get a ""Song unavailable"" error, which I know is false. Every time this happens, it causes a ton of other errors like playback stopping, no songs loading, etc and the only way to fix it is to close the app, reopen, and do that every time this happens. I don't pay $10 a month for a broken app, I'm considering changing apps if nothing is fixed."
"A lot of American artists songs aren't available for listening in the US. The shuffle is weighted, so you can never experience a true shuffle. The app is constantly crashing on my S9, and I get ""song unplayable"" after each skip. After 2 years plus of using soundcloud go, I have decided to to cancel my sub and use spotify. The app never works without error. It needs great improvement before I consider getting a subscription again."
I used to love this app so much.. I even pay for a subscription for pro unlimited. But now I am just frustrated and disappointed with the lack of the recording option. It doesn't really work for my needs anymore. It really makes me sad that it changed. I've been using the app for several years but I may have to find a new app. Uploading files takes up too much memory and data on my phone and it's much more time consuming and inconvenient. Please consider adding the record feature back to the app
"I really used to love this app (been using it since 2011). I've seen most iterations of the app. Years ago when they removed the cache control options it was disappointing. Being able to listen to cached songs on demand without internet connection (for example when on the subway) was amazing. But the greatest problem with the app is the fact that when you pause a song, getting it to play or change to another song is imposible, the app freezes. Also the waveforms dont sync with the music."
"A fine service. The application is buggy, yes. My issue is with the removal of the unique freedom-of-audio-mixer that this app provided. Until the most recent update I was able to listen to tracks while simultaneously on a phone call with my colleagues. Now this functionality has been ""patched"" because some normies cant pause their music or turn it down before their call. Just give me the freedom-of-choice and add it in the settings. Apparently the only app I can rely on for this is Blackplayer."
"Good app but I am deleting from my phone because it automatically plays music whenever I turn my car on and I've had enough of it at this point. Probably my car's fault too but after 5 years of using the app and dealing with music constantly being pounded into my head, I'd rather enjoy the silence. I will find another music app. It also does this when I'm not in my car, several times at work and that is just ridiculous."
"I was so excited to have access to some of these tracks that aren't on Google play, I figured I could use both for a road trip. I even went along with signing up for the free trial of their $5 plan with the intention of just removing my card later. It changed it to the $10 a month plan without me realising it and you can't remove a card or delete an account from mobile if you're on Android, you have to do it from a computer. No warning about this and no way to contact support about it. Thank you."
"Lately Ive had trouble with SoundCloud being VERY slow to load songs, search results, playlists, etc. It will frequently stop responding and force me to close and reopen it. The app doesnt need to be updated so I dont know what the problem is. If it gets any worse Im afraid it will stop working for me entirely :'( Ive been using SoundCloud for about 6 years now and I will be really bummed if I have to transfer to a different app."
"Used to love this app, its still pretty good but I can't stand the amount of ads. I play 2 songs and get a unskippeable minute long advertisement. I understand the necessity of ads but 4 mins of music to 1 min ad? Not worth in my opinion. My other main issue with the service is songs that are no longer playable, you don't know which ones they are so can't unlike them, you just have to deal with it."
"Doesn't autoplay like it used to and it chooses which songs to skip even though the track is playable. But trust that those darn ads are playable though. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app, clearing the cache, and restarting my phone did not work. This has never resolved itself (it has been going on for the past 6 months). I'm done."
"Truly Baffling Design Decisions: App does not allow repeated plays while chromecasting. They even remove the ""playing next"" menu entirely. This is an awful design decision, and since it ought to be the same UI whether casting or not, I can only assume it's intentional. I really only use Soundcloud to burn myself out on songs that get stuck in my head and aren't available elsewhere, but if I can't even do that from my TV speakers, I guess it's back to looping YouTube playthroughs."
"I have tried Soundcloud a few times. The first 3 or 4 times I paid the $4.99 a month because they claim you can download music and listen offline with a subscription. Each time all the music I downloaded either music was not there the next day, or if it was, it would not play. Then I switched to the $9.99 plan hoping that Soundcloud would perform as advertised but again the same issues. No offline playback, music disappearing and sporadic streaming. Don't waste your money on Soundcloud."
"Terrible app. Support system is extremely complex and confusing, app itself is extremely glitchy (almost to the point where it wont work) lots of bugs and long load times just to view your playlists, etc. Would be alright if there was fixes to all these problems, or if they even made an attempt to make it right, sadly neither are prevelant."
"The advertisements literally will make you deaf. There is an issue when a video ad plays that essentially makes the audio go into a loud static. Not only that, but sound cloud has removed features from their app like the ability to replay recently played music without using data. These features have obviously been moved to their paid service that I will never buy as long as I use their service. Overall, if you know an alternative use that instead of this greedy incompetent app."
"I used to have SoundCloud until I decided to try out Spotify. I tried SoundCloud again today and it's horrible, you can't listen to original songs unless to pay for a subscription. Everyone is open to use it so everytime I'm looking for a song, there are hundreds and thousands that are all either slowed down, sped up, a remix, or nightcore; not a single one is the original piece of music and it annoys me. The only plus side to it is that you can repeat songs without paying."
"This app used to be really good, but it's so terrible now. First you took away the ability to skip ads, and now you have 2 unskippable ads in succession, most of which are in Spanish -- my settings are in English??? I don't want to listen to a minute's worth of ads! Plus the app crashes so often at random, it makes it hard to use. And honestly, if it weren't for the fact that a lot of the songs here I can't find anywhere else, I would have been gotten rid of this app. It honestly just sucks."
"Obnoxious app. I opened soundcloud link then quickly turned it off. A few minutes later the app pops into my notification bar, playing more songs. I stopped it, but it wouldn't go away so I blocked it from notifications. Then I closed all apps. An hour later, I decide I want to put on a podcast and connect a bluetooth speaker and a really awful ""song"" is in the middle of playing. Stupid app had been running in background the whole time despite being closed many ways. Uninstall."
"I was so happy to see that my favorite podcast was available on google music because it meant I could uninstall SoundCloud. This is the worst app I have ever used. It closes itself constantly and loses your place, its interface is user-unfriendly, and the ads are obnoxious. Good riddance, SoundCloud, I hope we never have to meet again."
"Samsung s8+ has a crackling noise that makes listening to music on SoundCloud incredibly annyoing. I thought it was my speakers at first, then I noticed it on headphones. I looked into it and this is a common problem with s8 and looks to continue with the s9. I tried everything I could online to fix it but until it is fixed the app is useless for me."
"I'm very unhappy with the app currently because I was using it for a very long time and just recently when i tried listening to my playlist, most of the songs were suddenly only previews because of soundcloud go. These were songs that have been free to listen to for several months and even years and it's very frustrating that now they're behind a paywall. It's even more bothersome now especially since a lot of people are out of work due to the virus and possibly can't even afford to pay for it."
"it's a good app for music but over time it's not the greatest. I feel like there's a lot more ads than needed and the app can be a bit buggy sometimes. Edit: IT DELETED MY PLAYLIST (â¥ï¹â¥). It happened before but I just shrugged it off because I wanted to restart it anyways, BUT it just deleted 3 of my playlist. Two of them being ones I listen to all the time ð­ð­"
"The app I nice, but sometimes it cuts of the endings of songs while I'm listening to them. Starting to glitch a lot more now and load times have increased. My library takes a long time to load. When I try to play songs and keep songs playing in my library it starts to play random songs after I pick my song and not songs from the library. The music also stops in the middle now. It doesn't even play the songs in my playlists. It'll start off with one the switch to a random song. it always crashes."
"Frustrating user interface, plays music at random, automatically and annoyingly adds music to what I am currently listening to (despite having a playlist), hidden menus to even get to play the music, over all a very stubborn app. I understand the app forces you to listen to other artists, but force promoting content does not bode well for many customers. Recommend developers to adopt a friendly user interface, borrow one from Spotify or even Microsoft Windows Player on Win95 if you must."
"Super buggy, entire playlists contents sometimes disappear, songs frequently disappear, notifications and lock screen app don't work, lots of ads. Too bad I've invested so much time and effort to the music and playlists on my profile, none of it is safe. About to start over on another platform. I've been a SoundCloud user for 15 years and sadly they've gone way downhill; I would recommend trying something else."
"Having issues with streaming since subscribing to SoundCloud Go. Could be a coincidence. Stuttering, stopping, and no autoplay. I know this sounds like a connection issue, but I've had the same problem on 3 separate networks, all with strong signals. Can't even find how to unsubscribe on the app. Really bad experience. Update: I have the error ""In-App purchase service is unable to connect"" when this stutter happens. It happens almost every song."
"The SoundCloud platform and service performs well and as expected - tailoring stations and music selection and recommendations very well. The problem is when advertisements play, occasionally they are replaced with DEAFENINGLY loud white noise and static. I cannot overstate the high volume the white noise is produced at, it is painful and jarring. This issue has been documented for months via search. I will no longer use this platform until resolved."
"So, i live soundcloud. Ive been using it for the last two years but all of a sudden, today 8/28/2019. It stoped worrking. None of my music loads. Im connected to my wifi and i know its not my wifi or data acting up. When i tried to find a report button to get the problem fixed, i couldnt find one. Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling it three times already, and that didnt work. My tracks keep pausing withoutplaying at they say ""track univaible"" for my whole list."
everytime I listen to a song. any song. doesnt matter how low or high the volume is. It gets all staticy and it cuts off here and there. I open my Samsung music app to see if it's my speaker. and its not. the static only comes up when I play music on this app. my speaker is perfectly fine. itll even do the static when I have it connected to bluetooth
"Trialled Go+ because I love the desktop service and wanted to take music with me in the car, but I noticed some problems and my data useage increased. The app uses data even with ""only download via wifi"" enabled. No auto resume when returning to the car, so you've got to take out the phone and press play. If these were resolved, I'd consider paying $5/month, but $10/month is too much."
"it's a great app and has lots of popular songs and remixes, etc. but its lacking many basic features such as adding liked songs to a playlist in bulk. instead you have to add them one by one, many original songs can be hard to find, and have to be specific when looking for a song, very bad if they're trying to compete with spotify and others"
"Extremely depressing. Purchased ""premium"" and now the app can't even play music in the background. And while it's open, it stops the music every few seconds. There are no issues with WiFi, mobile data, or anything else, it's just SoundCloud. I'm using a Nord N10 if that matters."
The glitchiest music streaming app I've ever used. It constantly lags even with good internet and now all my songs I had liked (700+) for some reason disappeared. Unbelievable I just lost my whole music playlist. Whenever I come across a song I liked it's still liked and goes back to my playlist. Real nice glitch for a music streaming service. Definitely not a good app for that.
"HORRIBLE experience. It is wayyyyyy too difficult to cancel a subscription and although I followed all the steps on both the phone and the computer, the subscription charge was still made to my account. I hate this app. I hate the difficulty in canceling a subscription. the owners of this app just want the money. DO NOT USE THIS APP UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO GIVE AWAY. They make you jump through hoops just to cancel a subscription, and in the end, will still charge you account."
"This app has been a pain to use since it first came out. In some ways it's worse now than it's ever been. If I get a phone call while music is playing over Bluetooth, I can't keep playing over Bluetooth without rebooting my whole phone. I often listen to music in the car, so that's a huge bug that impacts my life. I actively hate using SoundCloud. And you want me to pay for a subscription? It was barely worth using when everything was free!"
"1 star so this gets seen. I love this app and I use it every day for music I won't find elsewhere, but recently, they made it so an ad will play in the middle of a song. Like as soon as you open your phone to like the track or see the name of it. You cant even skip it most of the time, and then it just goes to the next song in queue. This honestly drives me crazy. I dont mind the ads cause I know yall gotta make your money, but in the middle of the song? Really? Make it stop!!!!!!!"
"I love using SoundCloud but there's way too many ads now, I play 1 song that regardless of length, gets an ad after it finishes playing and I'm so fed up with it, why is this a thing now? Plus it crashes a lot and has a bunch of errors which I hope they become fixed in the future. I wish it was like before, where there wasn't as many ads and problems as there are now."
"You can't get an enjoyable experience out of this app unless you pay for the premium alternative, and it's clear that they've reduced the quality of the base app greatly to try and push people to buy it. The better option is to simply use another app that can do its job for free. The quality of tracks I upload are noticeably reduced, and the ads have been much more prominent for a while now. The only benefit to this app is that anybody can upload anything, so you'll find what you're looking for."
"I've had this app for years and never had a problem with it. However, I went to add another song to a playlist I had for just over 11 months. When I went to add the new song the app crashed. So, I restarted the app and when I went back, every single song in my main playlist was gone. I restarted my device to see if it was just a glitch that would go away, but it didn't. This really just made me mad because I seriously have no idea what happened."
"it gets one star because of its annoying forced material. when I stopped listening mid track, the app used to open again to the same spot I left off and it was convenient. Now they changed it so that when I open again, a new sponsored track is loaded for play and I have to find where I left off on the thing I actually wanted to hear. I come for the content of my choosing, not something you have blown up in my face that doesn't suit my interests."
"At first, it was a great deal! But as soon as I played aroud with it, some things just annoyed me so much. Firstly, the people who followed me are a part of sex services, and their is no way to block or report them! Secondly, the pause button always got stuck and I couldn't play music, please fix that bug. I had this app for a day because of all of this!"
"Used to be good. Ads were tolerable. Now there are ads every other song..sometimes double unskippable ads. Everytime I open the app it asks if I want to upgrade to premium. Gets worse every update. Now I'll have the music playing and I'll unlock my phone to see if I want to skip a song or whatever..just unlocking my phone skips the current song sometimes, and jumps into another ad..dont waste your time with this app."
"I was using the web version and when I tried to download it, it said I needed to install the app. I installed the app and it has now way to download the audio. Digging around, I discovered you have to pay extra for that. I contacted them about this but never heard back. I don't support companies that have misleading marketing campaigns like this, especially when their customer support fails to respond. Now that the audiobook is complete, I'm uninstalling."
"Advertisement quality is terrible. No way to downvote the poor quality ads that are not relevant. It's the same 3 or 4 ads cycling w/ no way to skip. This app used to be my main source for listening to music. In the car, at the gym, at work & at home. Switching back to YouTube, where at least their ads can be somewhat catering using their advertising software to play and display relevant ads that I would at least pay attention to & not immediately mute & then countdown in my head. Thumbs down!"
"Idk how soundcloud is rated above 2 stars, based on ads, features, and the miniscule selection. Literally a minute long ad every other song. If i wasn't trying to impress my ex i would just delete my account. smh update: the feature to remove songs from playlists isn't currently functioning, which means i am now just embarrassing myself in front of my ex. Thanks guys"
"This app is full of random bugs and has been for years. Tracks changing on their own, clicking on one track just to get a different track, getting a random ad when I try to seek through a song, tracks not playing when I click on them, tracks restarting or skipping when I try to seek through them, I could go on and on. This app, along with many others, is not optimized for Android, and it really shows. Half a decade worth of updates and not a single thing has changed. Using this app is a chore."
"What happened? I've been a paid Go+ user since 2016. Recently the app has been integrated to Android Auto, that great. Ever since this has happened the app has failed. I pick a playlist or album to play, the first song plays and then it goes to a different playlist that I made weeks ago. App does this every time. I'm not able to listen to an album or playlist of my choosing. Making this app useless. I've made so many playlists and saved so many tracks, but now I'm forced to cancel paid subscrip"
"Have used SoundCloud since prior 2011 and had ALWAYS been my go to, but in the last 6 weeks or so has been nothing but problems. Tracks continuously stop, and the program(as in SoundCloud) has to be restarted, and upon restart that track begins from the start. This happens on multiple devices and is becoming increasingly more frustrating. Hope you all can resolve the system issues"
"I usually really love SoundCloud, and I use it for basically everything, but it won't let me play any songs regardless. When I Uninstalled and reinstalled and still doesn't work and I'm very disappointed about this and I'm considering stopping using the app. I've restarted my phone a few times and SoundCloud is fully updated. It won't let me search or see anything."
I am having an issue playing music in my playlist after a song becomes unavaible. When I try to remove the song from my list the app crashes. When I try to close the app and continue to the next song on my playlist it won't start. I am very frustrated and annoyed to pay for a monthly service and can't even enjoy music when I want to. Fix this asap. In the mean time I'll use pandora since that app is working fine. Edit: I just ended my subcription. I'll just go back to Pandora.
"When you accidentally select an artist, the app automatically selects it as something you ""liked"". The app includes the artists along with similar artists on a playlist. There is no way to reset your list. I really don't want to see the explicit rap genre on my opening page. There needs to be a way to undo accidental selections or clear the history and reset the playlist."
Having issues with this app now. Using Go+ and it freezes up or stops mid way into songs and I can't skip or pause the song. I have to close out completely. And the download for offline use doesn't work either unless on wifi. What's the point of using for offline if i have to have access to wifi? I'm about to cancel my subscription. (--_--)
"The app is horrible and i can never find the songs I'm looking for unless it's a fan-mad or remix of the original album ,and it's frustating i can't get rid of the bottom black bar at the bottom of the screen instead it place an entirely different song from a different artist i don't even listen to. I'll stick to pandora and youtube for my music."
"really loved it, honestly. I used to listen to it all day but now whenever I have my earbuds plugged in and an ad pops up (I don't have premium so it's a LOT) the beginning will play before cutting to an extremely loud static. And by loud I mean you can very audibly hear it outside the earbuds even on low volume. I was hoping it would be patched with newer updates but nothing :( I've tried to uninstall and reinstall multiple times but it continues."
soundcloud usually works but now its doing this weird thing with my songs where it plays normal but shows its at the end of the song. This is annoying because there are certain parts of songs i like and want to rewind to but it is hard to pinpoint where they are because when u find it it goes right back to the end of the song but still plays normal. if you could please help me with this issue. i will change that rating. this is a guarentee.
"GARBAGE. Keeps on pausing songs 10-15 seconds in, no matter how much I reset my phone, configure the app, delete both app and phone cache & data, or configure my bluetooth headphones. It's 1,000% an in-app problem. Messes up playlists. Removes likes randomly. Overall just such a disappointing & waste of space and time. Developers better fix these bugs."
"I used to love this app and it's been my go to for years now, but recently it's really gone downhill. my playlists don't even load anymore. The app crashes every few tracks and I understand there needs to be some ads but an ad after every track is just ridiculous. That and there's so many songs that just say ""track unavailable in your country"" anymore. I've always loved you soundcloud, but what happened? UPDATE: GUYS PLEASE FIX THIS APP!! IVE BEEN PAYING FOR GO FOR YEARS NOW AND IT CRASHES!"
"Not being able to reorganize tracks within a playlist is extremely irritating. The new ""Instagram story"" style of artist reposts/uploads is also a major downfall. Because of this, I've quit using that function, which has always been my primary way of finding new music. I've used this app for years and this recent update is terrible. If this isn't improved upon I'm switching to Spotify."
"Recently the app started giving me frequent rogue notifications with the last song I listened to and a play button. I haven't actually used this app in months. It's the same song that appears in every notification, probably the last song I listened to months ago. I disabled all mobile notifications in the app settings but the rogue notifications are still coming."
"2 ads per song? I don't think so. I haven't used SoundCloud in a hot minute. I uninstalled it almost right away. It keeps forcing itself as the primary music player after opening it once. I thought Pandora had crossed the line with the amount of ads. Y'all clearly have the money and grom the looks of all your reviews, maybe y'all should invest in a UX team."
"Idea is good but the app is junk. It constantly takes over as the active music player. Example: Start the app on Monday and close it later the day. On Tues start any other music app (VLC, Spotify, Pandora, etc). You pause the music using a Bluetooth device such as headphones everything is OK. When you attempt to unpause the music this app starts up and plays music. This even happens if you force the app closed. Even after rebooting the phone and never opening this app it will take over."
I've had this app for about 5years but recently it's turned into complete TRASH! It takes forever to load and download new content and it deleted half of my Playlists. It take minutes just to play one song! Very disappointing and I think I'm done paying 5.99 a month for this useless app unless they fix all the bugs. Don't waste your time with it and I'm switching to Spotify.
"After every song, a 2 million second blank screen advertisement attempts to play, fails, and then pauses the start of the next song. After. Every. Single. Song. I love Soundcloud but this app has been broken for MONTHS. There is zero path to communicate the problem with them; no social media, no contact email, no helpdesk, nothing. Here's hoping this review makes a difference. This app is not usable in its current state."
"This app is only good for people who are creating content, but have no interest in monetizing it, as it is a liability. In trying to actually disable autoplay, a fix that has been requested for years, I force closed the app, disabled background use for all apps, and prohibited soundcloud from accessing battery in background, so it can only run when I open it myself. I turned on my car, and autoplay started. I cannot recommend an app that so brazenly violates security policy. it is unsafe."
"Ads are videos and not audio-only. Closing the app pauses the video. They're just repurposed Pandora ads anyway, so they should by all means be able to play in the background. Yeah, I could pay for Soundcloud Go, but if the developers are that incompetent, I'd be wasting my money. I'd much rather spend my subscription money on Spotify Premium, seeing as I only use Soundcloud for hyper-obscure re-uploaded songs from YouTube."
"The mobile experience is worse than bad. I cannot stomach the audacity of having an app that barely functions and requires me to close it completely to fix graphical glitches in the UI that prevent me from interacting with the stream, let alone to fix nonsensical connection issues. What really sells it, is when I have to watch ads AGAIN because I had the gall to restart the app just so I can tune into the stream in the first place. Truly a terrible mobile experience."
"Twitch mobile is the absolute worst way to experience twitch. The app is plagued with nonsensical playback issues, horribly unreliable audio/video syncing, buffering,and more. I can pull up a stream on my laptop and have no problem running it at 1080p, but on twitch Mobile, same internet connection, it will struggle to playback at pretty much any resolution. Sometimes it will decide to run at 240p until you go out of your way to manually reload the stream. This app is embarrassingly bad."
"Impossible to find anything and the settings and layout are not user-friendly. The streams lag a lot compared to the browser version. The app is required to do virtually anything when using mobile so you'd think they'd actually put effort into the app. The only reason I'm not giving it 1 star is because it is functional and does let you watch the stream, even if your experience watching it is horrible. Update: The authentication app doesn't work so I can't even sign in. It is now unusable."
"The UI on the Chromecast app only lists 12 VOD in any given library and that's it, even if the library contains hundreds of videos. Want to resume a video that you stopped part way through? Tough cookies, if it's not part of the 12 that are listed, that video will have to be manually searched for. Unless you have a qwerty keyboard remote, you'll have to use the on-screen keyboard with the included ""minimalist"" remote and the voice search doesn't work well with all the unique streamer names. Yet over on the Android mobile app, you have everything you need. You are able to scroll through a complete VOD library...and it has a last watched function. Want to join the live chat or view the chat from a past video? You can do that too, another feature lacking from the Chromecast version. It might be wishful thinking, but let's hope that Amazon fixes the Chromecast app to be more user-friendly."
"I use this app on a daily basis and lately the app has become utter trash. I have been getting asked nonstop to turn notifications on. It reappears every time I open the app. If i open my keyboard at all, whether I'm casting or watching on my phone, the resolution drops, hard. Not to mention that the resolution choice menu rarely opens and when it does it doesn't change the resolution. Ads should not be on first open, rather they should be intermittent in watching."
The new version of the app for Android TV is almost unusable. When watching any stream at a quality above about 720p the whole screen flickers black frequently and also the stream plays at a very low frame rate and is very choppy overall. I never had these kinds of issues with the previous version on the TV. Before I could watch 1080p streams and now it's unwatchable.
"I'm here to discuss the new ""update"" to the TV + console app. It's awful. Terrible. The result of what I can only assume is a misguided attempt to unify and merge the mobile + TV app. The UI is worse and loss functionality. Quality settings aren't remembered between streams or on a restart. Defaults to ""auto"" (never 1080p) despite being on a high speed stable Ethernet connection. Watching vods is painful. Live view list is randomized. No sort options The only thing it does well is serve ads"
"this may be the worst app I've ever used. there are seven ads every 15 minutes which is garbage. not to mention the app crashes very frequently on my Google TV. every other app I have on my Google TV functions perfectly. also the resolution will randomly drop even though it is on auto and I have plenty of bandwidth. when clicking the back button in the app, it's sometimes takes 10 seconds for the application to take you back. whoever developed this app should be fired."
"Twitch mobile continues its reign as the worst app on my phone. The only thing that makes it better than alternatives is that I can clip from it. Except that clips fail 75% of the time, and if you manage to edit them it ignores your editing end point anyway. It's just the worst. The desktop experience is 1000x better."
"Unfortunately I gotta give this a 1 star. I like Twitch and like using the app, but for the last few months the app has been quite bad. When watching live streams or vods, the audio and video are not synced, which is quite frustrating. This is not an issue when using Twitch on my iPad, and YouTube and other streaming apps do not exhibit the same issue when being used on my phone, so it is not Bluetooth lag, the app just doesn't work properly at the moment, which sucks."
"The most recent update is awful on TVs. You can't fast forward/rewind as easily and the streams you were watching on your phone or PC don't show up in the feed on the TV app so you have to search up the channel you were watching, go to the channel, find the video, THEN you can load the video which has your position saved. But the fact that they don't show the videos you have been watching when you open the app is asinine. This SUCKS!!!"
"Gray side bars, video goes to 360p then won't give you the option of going to higher res even if you connect to strong wifi unless you close stream and re-open. Channel rewards don't allow you to collect them unless you close stream and then re-open (then the green box will magically appear). Sound gets massively delayed often - have to force close app and reboot to get it back. Just overall too many bugs to recommend. Could be great, but fails on so many fronts."
"Everything about this app is terrible. I can't claim channel points, the chat is all messed up. When I go to send a message in chat, there are times the message does not send. When I close the app completely the audio continues. I haven't force stopped it yet so I don't know if that stops it but I have restarted my phone and that gets it to stop. Just overall this app can use some work"
"The amount of ads is beyond annoying. I thought Hulu was bad but this takes it to a whole new level. I couldn't get to watch 2 minutes of a streamer because the first time I come in there's 3 ads. No big deal. The next minute I had to sit through 6 of them. Not short ones, long ones. I truly never thought any app would be as bad as Hulu with adds but this took the prize."
"With the new version (the new interface), Twitch for Android TV has become horribly slow... The interface lags, and when watching a video there is a 1-2 second audio delay (I mostly watch replays, I have not tested in live video). I had none of these problems before the interface update few days ago. Problem on the Sony Bravia X80H, with Android TV"
"The new Chromecast app is horrible. You took away the ability to chat? The stream quality defaults to 480p everytime you load a steam. The back button exits the stream and doesn't close the overlay. You can no longer sort from high to low viewers, only what twitch recommends. Can't see clips anymore. I mean who decided to remove everything? Probably the worst ""update"" in an app I've ever seen. This is bad guys, you should accept it and just revert back to the old app. Don't make us wait 2 years."
"Casting to ""smart"" TV sucks, 9/10 casting is laggy, stream quality is constantly switching from source to auto. To change the quality setting each stream (casting only) you need to go to source (1080p, 720p, or whichever you prefer), tap which quality you want, close the app, then reopen and the quality you selected will be applied. I thought it was due to internet quality, I've narrowed it down to the twitch mobile app for android. Not sure how this app gets worse with every update..."
"Incredibly buggy app, especially when casting. Once casted to a TV you can't change resolution under quality options without first closing the broadcast. This is a newer issue, but this app has always been very buggy and slow. I can watch a stream in the highest resolution uninterrupted on my pc, but get constant quality and buffering issues through this app."
"Even when on a high speed network livestreams will still commonly buffer and are played in reduced quality. When playing vods the video player oftentimes just decides to stop working and freezes while still playing the audio. Sometimes it may fix itself after a few seconds or sometimes it may fix itself never. In addition, the amount of ads that I get while watching vods makes me feel like I'm watching cable TV. The YouTube app is infinitely better compared to the Twitch app."
"Everything was bad about the google tv update that happened in January - the UI looks terrible, video is downgraded constantly, video is higher contrast than it should be and itâs slow. The newest updates have only made it worse. The newest feature is that video crashes constantly and the only way to fix it is to force quit the app."
"The predictions don't work anymore, they don't show up until I exit the stream and re-enter. Chat disappears if I minimize the app for a minute and come back. I always receive an error when trying to redeem channel points. Not sure what happened in the last month or so, it wasn't like this before."
"Used to be good. Used to be able to watch streams with no problems. No lag. No black screens. No problems with audio sync. ""used to"" The app is horrible now. The predictions dont work. When a new prediction is started, the app doesnt show the new one. Just continues to show the old one has ended. Auto Quality changes is more like auto disconnect you from the stream. If you manually reset the stream ,oh look it works. Magic. The report issue menu just has a few fixed options and none ever apply"
"Despite knowing I can turn notifications off for Twitch in my android settings, I find it deeply frustrating that you get a pop up every individual time you open the app to 'turn on notifications'. The 'Not Now' option only works for the duration that the app is open, and you are immediately asked again when the app is reopened. The design choice to bother the user for notifications is very clearly intentionally annoying, attempting to wear the user down until they click yes. Disgusting."
"My rating is for the ps5 app. The recent update is beyond awful. They took away all useful features and made it absolutely basic. It feels like an app that would have been made 15 years ago. I don't know where to complain about the ps5 app, so I'm doing it here. Vods only go back like 5 days instead of the long list we had before. Can't hide menu quickly, can't read chat, FF and rewind is hard to understand and jumps way too much. Everything was perfect before like on mobile. Very unintuitive"
The Android TV version of this just got an update and it's buggy. The streams crash every 20 minutes or so. Only way streams start working again is by doing a force quit. I can't filter searches any more and when searching a category all the streams don't load. The prior version of the Android TV app was way easier to use and navigate.
"This app used to work just fine, but since the new UI update it runs horrible on Android TV. A single button press takes seconds to register, streams only stream at 720p or lower without constant buffering or flashing images. It's a shame because I used the app regularly and now I don't want to watch Twitch streams on my TV anymore because of it."
"Since Version 11 was released, it's been shockingly awful on my TCL TV. Streams lag, screen constantly flickers, framerate drops like you're looking through a fish bowl, navigating to Settings automatically places you over Unfollow (I almost accidentally unfollowed someone when trying to refresh/lower stream quality to stop lag) and backing out to the main menu to watch another stream closes the app entirely. Previous version of the app was great! Now it's unwatchable."
"New February update is terrible. Twitch app cuts in and out randomly. Streams are low quality, delayed and they've gotten rid of the chat function. On launch, the channels list status is not even up to date. When the stream locks up about 30 minutes in, pressing the back button takes forever to respond."
"Even setting a video to the lowest quality, on a 5G cell connection, it still doesn't work half the time. Definitely not as good as YouTube. Not to mention the whole verified account thing I'm having trouble with because somebody else already has my phone number listed but that's not about the app itself. I just mentioned that to say I'm really not impressed overall with twitch as a platform, I just started using it because I followed a YouTuber that started using it but it's been frustrating."
"the app has gone from a high quality enjoyable platform to an awful frustrating one. it's like y'all put out an update without even testing it. the streams are always loading, the video quality constantly downgrades to 240p, chat is constantly disconnecting, the livestreams have so much delay that it's impossible to keep up with what's going on, and way too much more list. it's honestly astonishing something like this made its way as an ""update"" when it's quite literally anything but that. revert the app to what it was, cause this new version isn't doing anyone any favors!"
"When you follow a channel, the app sends you notifications when the channel goes live. You can turn notifications off for that channel by visiting the channel. So that's OK, right? Nope! You need to sit through prerolled ads before you can tap the 'turn off notifications' button. I'm flabbergasted nobody (Amazon, Google, FCC) has a compliance problem with this. There should be a 'turn off notifications' button IN THE NOTIFICATION itself, like how YT does it. Until then, uninstall. Thank you!"
"Scrolling through categories (and any menu), tapping one, then going back will bring you all the way back to the top of the menu. It's almost 2023. How hard is it to keep track of where you were on the page instead of just resetting your position every time. That coupled with the fact that ads are more aggressive than ever before makes this app borderline unenjoyable."
"Doubles audio after phone is locked more than half the time. Also, doubles the chat replies and emote inputs after phone is unlocked more than half the time. Can not delete text by holding the backspace when editing the title of stream or even edit at a desired cursor. Missing many desktop features. Can not cancel subscriptions. It's been years I've been waiting for these to be addressed.... Do better with your platform. Disatissfied with the lack of attention for the smaller communities."
"I really can't believe a major social media platform like Twitch (owned by Amazon), is seemingly incapable of making a good Android app. Every ""update"" seems to break yet another function. Their pushed Amazon Firestick Twitch app is so bad, I had to go search for an old version and sideload install it. This MUST be intentional, or these app developers are totally incompetent. I've contacted both Twitch and Amazon about this. They don't care. Unbelievable. You can do more with a web browser. ð"
"The most bug filled social app, you can imagine. I always end up having to refresh the app because something always goes wrong. Wether it's a poll glitching out and not showing up, to the stream randomly freezing up. Emotes shows up as text instead of animation. Constant channel point redemption errors. You can't browse a streamers channel while watching a Livestream. I wonder why this app exists because nothing ever seems to get fixed or work right. I have to buy a PC just so I can use twitch."
"I use the Twitch app on my Google Chromecast with Google TV. It has a few very annoying flaws. First, it often fails to remember where I last left off in a past broadcast. It starts me at the beginning and I have to fast-forward to find my way back to where I was. Second, speaking of fast-forwarding, the video navigation is terrible. My only option to navigate is rewinding and fast-forwarding at set speeds? Get with the times and implement direct scrolling of the progress bar like YouTube and Netflix! Third, when watching a past broadcast (I don't know if this happens when watching a live stream), after some period of inactivity, the Chromecast goes to its screensaver. Then, I have to press a button on the remote to ""wake it up"", but then, sometimes, I start back at the beginning of the broadcast! These are inexcusable flaws that must be fixed."
"I rarely review apps, but there is a major bug that I've experienced for a few weeks that is unacceptable, and I couldn't find a way to report it in the app which is also unacceptable. If you view a stream you are not subscribed to and it starts playing an ad, then you back out and switch to a stream you are subscribed to, you can still hear the ad playing in the background. No ads is one of the very few benefits of subscribing to a steamer. No idea how a bug like this gets through."
"The app works great for what is there, but has a major, unforgivable flaw right now. For some reason, the devs decided to remove the play/pause button for live streams. I cannot fathom what they were thinking when they did this. Having the option to pause the video seems like the bare minimum for any streaming service. I understand that twitch is different from Netflix and YouTube, but twitch used to have a pause button, and you can pause on the desktop site so there is no excuse for this."
"I keep having an issue where 100% of the audio cuts out while watching a previously recorded stream. It happens Multiple times during the streams and stays silent for up to 10 minutes at a time. It is not due to copyrighted music, for sure. The app doesn't seem to have a ""help"", ""support"", or ""contact"" option anywhere for me to send this issue. So I've rated this a 1 Star in hopes somebody will see it. App is definitely worth 5 Stars though. Great platform delivered in a great, easy to use way."
"(On mobile app) Audio cuts out for minutes at a time, all the time. App crashes, all the time. Streams start over if you are watching a playback, answer a text, and resume, all the time. Audio doesn't line up frequently. I have done everything possible on my end to try to lessen these instances, no luck. Help team is zero help. Would rank 0/0 if possible. Awful mobile app, great platform. Looking around, I'm not the only one with these problems. Just fix it please."
"When I click on a someone's page it will not let me scroll down to videos. So I can't scroll through a streamer's videos at all. It will show me the top of the bar that says videos and chats but won't let me scroll at all. And on a few other areas of the app I'm not able to scroll. which makes the app almost impossible to use. I have an S8 and a perfect wifi connection. So far not a fan of the app. From a new user's standpoint, the app is difficult to use amd confusing. Will update."
"The play back issues are unbelievable. I cant watch stream for more than 10 minutes without the stream getting frozen in buffer, and 9 times out of 10 nothing will fix it, I just have to switch to another platform. Not to mention audio delays and voice changing in videos. You guys make a lot of money off your viewer base, there should be an app that functions properly."
"App is TRASH. I literally don't mind ads; that's how creators get their money. But when it bugs out and freezes the stream, or keeps playing audio and not the video, it SUCKS. Occasionally it'll freeze my phone too, and I have to completely restart my phone to get it to work again. Serious safety concern. I'll change my rating if this is fixed, but till then, if I could, I'd give 0 stars."
"I was watching a vod and it forced me to sit through 3 ads in the span of an hour. I wouldn't complain that much about it, but it also continued to video through the ad and desynced the audio and I can't fix it without restarting the app. Everytime you full screen a video it also shows the subscribe button which obscures half the screen. I know this app could be so much better, but it doesn't seem like anyone tried."
"Garbage. Every other video streaming app on my phone works fine, but Twitch studders and buffers constantly. The interface is very quirky, for example if you're watching a previously aired broadcast, and you switch to another app, it will continue to play in a small window on the screen. But when you switch back, it jumps back to where you were before you switched. Skipping forward or backwards is painful, as if you miss the tiny hotspot on the screen, you get to wait for it to buffer 30+ sec."
"I had heard from a friend that the popup player had finally been implemented, so I gave it a try this morning. It worked well. Until I needed to pause the prerecorded livestream, which I had been watching for 15 minutes. There was no pause or play button on the popup, so I went back into fullscreen mode and paused. Then I came back, and found that the popup had reverted back to where I had started. Please fix the popup; it's a deal breaker for me if the app insists on using my whole phone."
"I like the content available in twitch, and thats the only reason I even keep the app installed. But functionally I can't stand it. The search is awful, comes up with all kinds of unrelated results. Feeds are difficult to find. Videos auto-play if the channel is live casting, spoiling results if you're behind in watching a tournament. The casting to other screens is super twitchy (pun intended, but not funny). Every time I try to use this app, it frustrates me, mostly due to poor navigation."
"The worst streaming app ive ever used, and that's saying something. With full internet connection, it would load for almost 10 minutes to get half a second of the stream, only to go back to loading. And before you say to adjust the stream settings, I've tried that and it didn't work at all. Also, my phone is a google pixel 3a, a three year old model, which is not supposed to have any trouble with apps like this. I'm never downloading this terrible app again."
"Ads everywhere. I can't open up any stream without getting hit with an ad. If it was a 15 second ad, it would be bearable. It's always a 30-60 second ad which is way too long for opening a stream. I can go to any mobile browser and view the stream ad free, which comes at the cost of not being able to interact with the stream but worth it. After watching an ad I can't even jump between streams without getting hit with another ad."
"Twitch cannot, no matter how many apps I delete, no matter how many times I restart my phone, no matter what I try, load my friends stream. It can perfectly load every ad that comes up before it, so I know it's not my internet. However, as long as I really feel up to watching his stream, Twitch will decide the friend I'm in the same city in is actually at the bottom of the Bermuda Triangle, and cannot be loaded. No updates available, no fixes, not solutions. Just adds and a loading screen."
"Twitch is amazing- and their platform has enabled an entire new genre of entertainer, including such incredible folks as Critical Role and Day9. Unfortunately, the app has been barely functional over the past few years. Particularly terrible is the track location, which resets arbitrarily when in ""play in the background"" mode. As of today full screen and forward-/back-track buttons aren't working. I'd love to keep supporting this platform, but these issues need to be resolved."
"When ads end and a video continues (or starts) audio pitch becomes lower and I have to exit and reopen the video. Sometimes I even have to skip forward until I find where I stopped. And if the app decides to play another pre-stream ad despite just watching one, I have to do that again until it decides not to. Sometimes streams don't even play after the ad finishes."
"Twitch as a streaming platform is fine. It has the occasional issue, but what doesn't? This app, however, is trash, and that's putting it nicely. Most of the updates make the app slower. The app randomly crashes. Videos constantly buffer, no matter how low the resolution is set. Sometimes the app never fully loads in at all. I would recommend if you can avoid having to use this app, please do. It's unacceptable for an app to be this buggy, laggy, and crashy, and still have 4.5 stars."
"App is just hot garbage. It is always either glitching or totally freezing up your entire phone. I say ""I fkn hate Twitch"" literally about 10x a day. And if you want to watch some older cataloged vids, good luck. You have to scroll through hundreds of pages, then once you start a vid the app randomly crashes and you have to start all over again. Probably the most frustrating app I have ever used. Somehow the ads always seems to work perfect though!"
"This app is the most, under developed, lag riddled, glitchy app I have ever seen. When you are watching a livestream, or a video after the stream is over, if you can get it to load, everything is fine until the advertisements pop up. After the conclusion of the add, a few variables occur. The video doesnt load, if it does load, it has distorted sound and video, if you have to reload the video or stream, it will lose your place, so you have to go through the whole video to find where you left off."
The latest update SUCKS!!!!!! 1. Live followed channels - Everyone is offline. 2. The constant ads. 3. Skips in video when you are able to find a Streamer to watch. 4. Upon starting the app - freezes and shuts down or won't load at all. The list includes a number of other items that I just don't have time to type. PLEASE FIX THIS APP!!!!
"App is clunky, but that's the least of the problems I had with it. First major problem I had with it was when it sucked up 2 gigs of data in 10 minutes when I was watching a vod with quality options in AUDIO ONLY. Experienced dramatic variability in data rate experienced even when exclusively watching streams that had quality options with quality set to 160p. Then last straw was when it locked when browsing profiles, with network activity pegged sucking data full speed."
"The app has gone downhill after the latest update. It will play multiple ads with no problem but the moment the actual video starts, it won't play. There is a ridiculous amount of ads that are way too long and that can't be skipped that are also louder than the actual stream. The least amount of ads that you'll get is two, with both of them being 30 seconds, and the max amount of ads I've gotten in one sitting is 12."
"Ads are getting a bit out of hand. I realize they are necessary but not to this extent. What makes it extra annoying is that I have great wifi and yet every stream I watch ends up freezing now. This causes me to reset the stream and no matter how many times it has to be done I get another ad every time. And the ads play perfectly even though the streams have to be reset 6 or 7 times for buffering and freezing. Been visiting Twitch less and less, think it's time to move on completely."
"The new update has broken many things, including the 'Search' function (the function with the magnifying glass that allows you to look up channel names). It loads but your keyboard doesn't appear on the screen no matter what you try, so you can't look up anyone. I've tried rebooting my phone, reinstalling the app (rebooting my phone and checking there are no residual files left behind before installing it), checking all settings and app permissions. Nothing has worked."
"The app is terrible on my Samsung Galaxy S10 but I assume other devices as well. It doesn't pick up the mic, which works fine in calls and recording videos or using the native screen recorder. It will also cut the stream without warning happened last two occasions to me after 2 minutes. It is also very fiddly to start and manage a stream."
"If it wasn't for twitch being the only popular (monopolized) live stream platform I wouldn't use it. Obnoxious ads every time you refresh to counter the guaranteed delays. Terrible mobile usability with issues. For example; Open a stream and 3, 30 second ads play? Can't exit it unless you minimize it within the app and press the tiny X. Exit the app? It will force play ads in PIP mode and there's no option to open the app to get rid of it because it just bugs the PIP UI and prevents interaction."
With every update the app lags so much. It doesn't matter what quality I have a stream set to. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app so many times. I've forced closed and cleared all data. Nothing fixes it. It doesn't matter if I'm on wifi or mobile data. Also whats the point in having an app to watch live streams if I'm always gonna be multiple minutes behind the stream?
It never remembers your prefered resolution. It's so annoying to have to constantly go to the settings when switching between channels. The search tool is the worst iv ever seen. It will only show a channel if you type the exact name. Want to check in on a streamer you watched a while back? Well tough luck unless you remembered the underscore and lower case z in his name.
"-5* tried to use for streaming - it constantly stopping streaming on its own and even on some occasions it looks like you are streaming when in fact your not. When streaming, screen freezes after few minutes and you have to restart stream to fix it, option to keep stream running when tou switch to different app and back ?! That does not even work... absolutely useless app. Avoid"
"I gave this a 1 star because everytime I watch a video on twitch the audio just goes out. I don't know if it's just me or twitch. I tried deleting and downloading and it didn't work like one second the audio is fine and then the next it's just gone but it's only the audio the video plays fine no buffering, lagging, none of that it's just the audio."
"WAY TOO MANY ADS!!!! I love when i click on a stream to find out what is going on and get 2-5 minutes of ads shoved down my throat. Not to nention this also happens every few mins while watching. Oh, also that's apparently not good enough for them and now they're gonna give you incredibly obnoxious banner ads for 30+ seconds every 5 minutes because money money money babey!!!! This is a horrid, awful app rotten with an insufferable amount of ads as if amazon/twitch doesn't generate enough money."
"Chat is intolerable now. With an external keyboard, every time I try to type a message in chat, I can type ONE LETTER and then the cursor disappears. I'd have to tap the text box again to continue typing. This has ruined my immersion and I haven't used twitch in the past month+ since it has started happening."
Cannot save my stream even though copyrighted sounds are turned off. it won't let me activate it in the app on xbox as for whatever reason the activation site is not showing up and the qr code is not working. Over all just very disappointed with the app ever since the update and the service since the last update
"Good job, you killed the mobile browser version and forced this app upon us, but streams are unwatchable when using bluetooth earbuds. The audio is delayed for 0.5-1s and this bug has been around for a year already and still hasn't been fixed. Absolutely unwatchable experience."
"as a small streamer, I feel it's important for all my viewers to come into my stream. video for them AND MYSELF just shows a black screen no matter what they do, ONLY ON ANDROID DEVICES!!!!! nothing I change in obs fixes this issue! none of your provided fixes actually fix the issue at hand! I'm so beyond frustrated with this app on Android that I'm thinking about quitting again.... (go figure the iOS version works.....a minority operating system......)"
"Your app is HORRENDOUS to use. Contacting support is impossible because of the 4 or 5 options listed as options, none of them are vaguely relevant to everyday app issues. Not to mention the constant Salesforce screen of ""problem logging in due to authentication issues."" Like seriously, how is anyone supposed to use the app when logging in is a 25% chance of it working? Then getting help for anything else is impossible due to poor help choice options? Do better."
I watch twitch on Android TV through a chromecast 4k. Whenever a long web link (like the ones twitch uses for clips) is put in chat then it pushes the chat off to the left of the chat bar. Meaning the usernames and chat content vanishes to the left. Once the link works it's way off screen the text justification fixes itself.
"No matter where I am, no matter how good if a signal I have, wifi or not; it doesnt matter. Twitch buffers. And stutters. And lags. And this happens to my brother on his phone as well. No thank you. When Rumble and Youtube have zero issues, but Twitch does, this is concerning."
"This app used to work great in every way. Now it won't even open. I uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my phone. Everything I can think of has been done, to no avail. I think the new android web services update broke your app."
Terrible UX. Why can't you make normal video controls like in other apps? Why does double tap has to open chat as well as swipe from the right? Can't you make double tap skip 30s? Also the controls disappear when streaming on TV (Pixel 7)
"Annihilates battery, overheats phone, can't get channel points while casting, video quality settings don't work while casting so it's just permanently auto quality (which means permanently 480p even with fiber internet), video quality settings also never save and always revert to auto, and ads will sometimes play on my phone while casting to my TV. Been like this for years at multiple addresses, new ISP's, new routers, new phones, chromecasts... Preeeettty big issues for a streaming app."
"Nice of them to remove VOD quality option on mobile. Forcing your viewers on auto doesn't really help with the experience. Before, I was able to set my VOD and streaming quality to 360 or 480p to save data. Now that option is gone with the recent update and replaced with Auto as a default."
"User interface is atrocious on mobile. How a company as large as twitch is unable to fix their only mobile app is beyond me. If you use twitch, stick to desktop or give up using this app. It's useless in every aspect compared to the desktop version."
"Update, 2023: I'm STILL having issues with clips. Now it loads but the video and audio refuse to sync, with the video randomly speeding up like I'm playing it at 3x speed while audio is normal. I just tried it now for science. Twice, the clip played normally. Four times, the clip played normally but randomly sped up the video and froze on the last frame while audio played. Five times, it did this the instant it loaded. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WRESTLE THE PLAYER TO MAKE A 30-SECOND CLIP WATCHABLE FFS"
"Please!! twitch add a dedicated refresh button to refresh the stream. it always bugs me to have to close and open the stream again whenever my internet lags, making me like a minute late on the livestream. The automatic refresh always makes the stream am watching buffer alot."
"The flickering that other users are describing in TV cast is it resolution switching. Beyond it making no sense, as I have great internet... if it keeps dropping to 720 then just stay there after 2 failed attempts?! The constant change is obnoxious and borderline unusable, as my TV eventually just disconnects after too much res switching."
"As a new person on this app, I find it incredibly difficult to use. Features don't work as they should, so you think the app is recording when you switch to a different screen to play or discuss things but it isn't which means you've wasted hours talking or playing for nothing. Lack of options for different recording styles and I see no way of uploading premade videos for those of us who make other types of vlogs. Please fix these issues and improve site navigation and add site tutorials."
"Edit: 2 months later and this issue still hasn't been fixed, it's clear twitch care a lot about customer satisfaction, pay to subscribe to someone but haven't got a single notification in a year. I have notifications turned on but haven't had one notification for at least 8-9 months."
"Loved it until I tried to use it on anything except for a computer. Phones are trash for connection and good luck interacting with Twitch's menu on the console, it's an absolute joke. Earned an uninstall, and a 1 star review. Do better, Twitch."
"The android TV version of this app got substantially worse and worse over time. Older versions of this app were not great, but fine. The browse window was slow, but as soon as you selected a stream to view, the video quality was decent. The current version of the app is basically unusable. All streams stutter and freeze all the time, while all other stream apps I use work flawlessly."
"I don't know what happened, but I believe since a recent update streams start cutting out, freezing for a second or for 30 sec+ at a time or cuts out with a flashing black screen at random times. To refresh the stream I need to back out to the profile and navigate back, which is sluggish and often ends up leading to me pressing buttons i didn't mean to or go back to the main menu. I like watching streams on Twitch, but currently on Google TV it isn't the best experience."
"Immediately after latest update i can no longer watch anything. The video stutters leaving you watching a paused image whilst audio continues, then jumps ahead to catch up with audio before stuttering again. Literally had no issues before the update. Is there a way to roll back to last update so i can actually use this app??!"
New update causes my phone to vibrate anytime a stream starts or stops this includes ads idk if it happens per ad ie if 7+ ads start/stop to switch ad to ad will it vibrate every time? Edit#1 This only happens on twitch. I just flat out close the app more often then not as ads will now annoy me even more. Edit#2 I had to go into the app perms and reset them to on and then off again as that is what seemed to be the cause which is annoying.
"Why do you keep introducing bugs with each new update? They all persist across multiple updates and you never fix them. You introduced them. The least you can do is fix them. And the new sidebar ads are awful. Why? Just why? And then there's the constant constant constant constant intrusive ads. Virtually nothing about this app is good. It's obvious the devs only thinking ""how can we make more money?"""
"Its hot garbage. Audio gets desynced after like 2mins. The the chat covers significant portion of the video in landscape(the video doesn't resizes to fit chat). Whenever I turn my screen on after turning off while a vid plays, it changes its orientation to vertical, the video becomes black, chat becomes empty but I can still hear the audio and back button does not minimizes the vid, You have to tap recent apps/home to get out of the app. All of these happen for both livestreams and vods."
"The latest update completely broke this app on Google TV. While it was never great before it was at least usable and somewhat performant. Now it's just a nightmare to use. When watching a stream and using the back button the app literally doesn't react for about 5 seconds before it actually goes back to the previous screen. I have closed the app by accident because of of this plenty of times. The quality setting always reverts back to auto. The streams are suddenly lagging. The whole app is slow and laggy. A highlighted button is bright white with a black border and a purple outline...who on earth designed this??? There is probably more but this ""refresh"" is an embarrassment for a company like twitch."
"I want my ""Continue watching"" back! Also, since the last update, there is a huge lag when you back out of a stream, making it a huge waste of time to try and find someone live to watch when nobody you follow is live. The auto throttling of video quality is also a huge pain. When I set it to 1080p it's because I want 1080p. Stop changing it back to a lower resolution."
Video quality options have been reduced to Source and Auto. This makes the app unusable for me because it always tries to stream high quality and doesn't auto adjust so it buffers endlessly.
"I'm a DJ and I rarely stream from my phone on this platform, but lately, the audio it doesn't come from my mixer and I can't give a good quality sound to my listeners, even if I connect it through my irig and a xlr-jack 6.3 cable. I don't know what happened with this app, before worked perfectly, but now with the new updates it's such a pain in the a**. Please resolve this, the other platforms works good, the sound comes straight from my mixer, but this not anymore."
Don't know when it started but now when I watch a streamer an ad pops up and doesnt play. It also turns the streamer audio off. Done it multiple times and it's getting very annoying.
"Stream video keeps freezing on mobile but audio continues after latest update. App also doesn't trigger watch streaks or channel points rewards like it should. Usually requires a restart and the bonus shows up right away, but if you're not subbed means sitting through even more ads. Sad that Twitch wants their app to perform like this."
"Tried to sign up and make an account. I wanna join some streamers i like. However, the sign up process is unnecessarily tedious. I spent 30 minutes trying to make one and it keeps doing this flashing thing on my screen. Not sure what that whole thing is about, but it was very buggy and impediment to becoming a member. 0/10â­"
"Forces login for no legetimate reason. Just needed starting stream notifications. Also I cancelled all subs and stopped gifting, since twitch continues forcing ads regardless of how much I pay them through sub fees on other channels. Turbo is no alternative."
"Literally the worst app. With each update, the functionality of the app gets worse and worse. I've experienced constant crashing and non-stop buffering, which I never get on PC. Twitch doesn't care about their viewer experience and it really shows."
Completely unimpressed! This app is WAY too basic for the cost! I haven't found a single thing other than masking that I can't do in other apps such as Polish. You can't change perspective during masking. The intuition of the object removal is poor. You can't overlay images. Can't extend images. It's very slow. And so on and so on. I can't find several settings it claims you should have. I've looked under everything! Their search always comes up no results. Very sorry I paid for this!
"TRASH! I want to love this app. Works great on the phone, but it's absolutely trash on the laptop! Always ""not responding."" Crashes during edits, uploads or exports. Attempting to use on 3 laptops and 1 desktop...no difference. Updates make zero difference. Customer support is always nice, but never resolves issues. Overall, disappointing."
"4/28/23 For an app that I'm paying for, this is the most problematic one I've ever downloaded. It crashes more than it works. Constantly freezing. 4/22/23 I just downloaded this and paid for the subscription. Just trying to edit 1 short video and the app keeps crashing; crashing and freezing before I can even choose an edit option. Keeps freezing and then also rendering my phone unable to do other stuff too because of it. I have ample space on my phone, and I'm not even using wifi but data."
"This app is absolutely horrible!! As a professional photographer there is nothing more frustrating than working with an app that constantly locks up. And now all this ridiculous thing does is spin. I can't import my images, can do nothing with this. I have uninstalled and reinstalled dozens of times. This is ridiculous!! What does everyone else use? I shoot with Expert RAW on my Ultra 23, and I need something reliable."
I don't like how the app blanks out the numbers on the sliders as you make changes. It makes seeing what I did very difficult to figure out and manually revert. You can't hit zero with a fat finger unless you can see a number. They also charge for options that are free in other apps.
"I haven't been able to use this App at all today. It continues to crash within five seconds of opening. I've unistalled, force stopped, and clear cache many times. Nothing is working. I pay monthly to use this App to edit my photography pictures. I depend on this in order to get my clients their pictures in a timely manner. I'm extremely disappointed right now, but I hope to change my review if this problem gets fixed."
"App constantly crashes. I have had pictures completely disappear. Now photos are constantly in a sync state. I try to share with clients and it freezes. When it does work it does not show all of the photos, if any at all. This is not the best photo editing nor is it the cheapest. I will not be renewing."
"This app [was] awesome. I had used it for months, and it works wonders on photos with my Note 8. However, the moment I tried to share a photo directly through the app (I had previously saved to my device, and then shared from my device), my phone went haywire. It deleted messages in my phone, I lost functionality, my phone shut down multiple times... Nothing like this ever happened before, so I highly doubt it's just a coincidence. This app might make your phone an expensive paperweight."
"This app was great, but it must have been some recent update that broke it. My photos are no longer loaded for me to easily edit them. It worked just fine before with smart previews, but now whenever I tap on a photo, it has to load for a few seconds before I can actually edit it. Huge obstacle to workflow especially if internet connection isn't strong. What's the point of storing local photos, if it still had to mini sync each time? And on top of that, once loaded, it's very laggy. I'll make an adjustment and I won't be able to see the result for a few moments. It just ruins workflow. And I know it's not a phone issue because I've ran it just fine before, and I have a Pixel 2 XL which is a powerful phone. Fix your program, Adobe."
"An enormous chunk of my photos in the app are back to their originals again. I lost all of my edits that I did not physically save, which yes, I know is partially my fault. Some photos I made like 6-7 versions and only saved one, but now none of them are available. I'm crying over the loss of a few photos I spent a lot of time working on. I thought the app would be reliable. It's my favorite to edit on, but now I'm so upset about losing all the hard work. LR can you help?"
9/22/18. I have used this app for two years. For the past 5 months the app just crashes and won't even open. If you get it to open well that's where it stops. Because it definitely crashes before it even opens up your photo folders to choose a photo to edit. The app use to be 5/5 and I used it for everything in conjunction with another app Snapseed etc. Nowadays I cannot recommend it. I waited two months after a software update to see if they would just update their app to fix any issues. No still nothing. Adobe has always lacked in customer support so I doubt this issue will ever get fixed. Time to find more editing software. The funny thing is they charge for this too and it diesn't even work anymore...
"I will admit that I love the camera included with the app, and prefer it over pretty much any other camera app out there 2nd only to Pro Shot. I have syncing disabled because, for whatever reason, Adobe provides no way for me to view my pics in the cloud. It tells me I have 29.3gigs up there, but when I view the images in Lr, there are holes and glaring inconsistencies. But the worst is when whole shoots go missing, which is what happened today. Freezing rain, 3 hours, 50 shots- gone. I get home, connect to my desktop, open Lr, select the device to import, nothing. I open the app on the device and I can see the pictures plain as day. I move them into a folder which is visible on the desktop. Nothing. I realize I have to let it sync in order for the photos to show in the desktop version of the album. So against my better judgment I turn on syncing. Initially everything looks great. I see photos getting downloaded to my desktop. I keep waiting for todays photos to appear. Nothing. So I check the device: 39 photos in the album. All of todays shots gone. Not deleted. Not anywhere. Like they never existed. Maybe they are stuck in the cloud somewhere. I'll never know. All I know is this really sucks. I do not know about the developers at Adobe, but my time is pretty important to me. Losing 50 shots & wasting 3 hours is not the end of the world, but it represents turning what should be an escape from the stress & struggle of a 70 hour work week into another frustration to pile on top. And that, like this app, is something I do not need."
"The update completely messed my life up. I'm always on the go. I edit directly from my phone 99% of the time. The update crashes. Said I had to free up storage when I didn't need to. Takes too long to get ""smart previews"", won't export. Please fix your app. I need lightroom working. I dont pay $10 a month to bot be able to use my lightroom."
"Do not buy the pro version!!! I, as you were, was impressed with this app. So i decided to buy the pro version... Unfortunately, all of the filters, all of the use cases, etc are included in the free version... you will NOT achieve anything useful by buying the full version... Help yourself, and keep using the free version. Believe me, you are not missing much!!!"
"Seems like a good app, but unfortunately while in photo editing mode all the tools are too far at the bottom of the screen and are completely covered by the Navigation Bar (the âBackâ, âHomeâ, and âMenuâ buttons on Android). This makes the app almost completely unusable as every time you try to click a tool, the navigation bar pops up again and blocks them or sends you back to your home screen. Please fix this, this app has a lot of features I could get good use out of. (Samsung Galaxy S9+)"
"I downloaded this app based on solid recommendations from professional photographers. Despite having current software on my Note 8, all of the features didn't download. The SS Auto, ISO, and white balance settings were found at the bottom, not the top, of the screen, and missing other functions like the gridlines from ""the rule of thirds."" Disappointing and a waste of time. I really wanted to like it because or the DNG photo feature."
"Update: After rarely using it for a year, the app started working great for a few weeks in early-mid March, now it's back to crashing every 20-30 seconds. Can't get through a single picture edit without multiple crashes. Thought i was finally getting my money's worth for the first time in 3 years...WRONG! 2018 review: Constantly crashes and takes forever to load. Tired of dealing with it, especially when editing and uploading photos to the internet is part of my job."
"On the galaxy tab s4, supposedly the best android tablet available, the app is garbage. Takes minutes to display thumbs. Takes 20 seconds to load an image, if it can do it at all. It often just tries indefinitely. It crashes constantly. It's basically unusable. Works perfectly on my iPhone and iPad. Even my son's 4 year old iPad. Such a shame, as I was looking forward to using this with it's oled screen."
"Ok but takes FOREVER to sync. I like being able to quickly (basically) edit photos on my phone. But waiting for them to show up in LR elsewhere makes it not very efficient at all. It should not take 8+ hours to upload ONE photo. I don't have trouble with any other apps so I don't think it's my wifi. Contacted Adobe and was told to clear the cache. That helped for about 2 days. I've once again been trying to upload ONE photo for over NINE hours. Also, there is no way to stop it."
"I've just reinstalled this app with hopes that it would function properly, but it is without question the most undependable app I've ever used. It CONSTANTLY locks up, crashes and is unresponsive to my selections. It does a very good job of improving my photos, but every task is a major ordeal to complete. The most surprising thing about this app is when it functions without getting stuck or being unresponsive. Beware! This app is a dud. They better fix it soon!"
"Most useful features not available without an upgrade of $5 per month. ""FREE"" is just bait and switch tactic. If I needed all these features daily it might be worth it, but not for occasional use. They should limit use of the ""premium"" features to like 5 photos per day or per week or something so it's actually free for ""lite"" users, but folks that use it a lot have to upgrade."
It's so hard to use. Just to delete something is the most complicated thing ever. I have a pay pro version. I use Adobe suite all the time on a laptop. It's great but Adobe Android sucks. There is no erase function. No magic wand. No quick select. No layers. You're touching the screen so you can't really see what you're doing with any kind of precision. It sucks what can I say. It's competitor picsart has at least made an attempt to have a quick remove function. Come on adobe get it together!
"Incredibly slow when importing photos (even the part where it finds new files, this 'process' takes minutes to see even ~10 photos... then you have to Import, which takes a few more minutes, and then 'Sync' to cloud which often takes 10s of minutes for some reason. Then, on your other devices, you have to sync again, but on my phone it loads the Smart Preview one by one, as you view pics, and doesn't seem to take advantage of wifi to do this during sync time. And then...crashes all the time"
"Been horrible since last update....used to work very well. Now I cannot see my photos in LR (screen all black), I can rarely edit if I happen to guess correctly and get the right photo by tapping on the completely black library. At this point its completely useless for me since I cannot see or edit my photos on my phone. Would love to see this app back up and running, it was my Favorite."
"The images taken by this camera app end up looking nothing like the viewfinder or thumbnail previews. It shows you're taking a normal, regular photo. Then you go into Lightroom to see the pictures and they look completely different, washed out. They look pretty terrible compared to the ""picture preview"" that you see in the camera while snapping the photos. Such a weird issue. I wish this was a more reliable camera app"
"App keeps stopping, beyond frustrated and it will not allow me to import or edit. It is up to date and everything. In addition it's counting down a trial I never signed up for. I contacted support multiple times and agents tell me there is no trial. So on top of not working, it's counting down a nonexistent trial. September 4th 2021 update: The app is still trash."
"After looking through photos of my mom & me at the same age (maybe 9-10 years old) I wanted to edit mine to look similar to her original sepia tones, but after being forced to update the app, all options were gone. I couldn't move further until I gave a review (1 star) and upgraded, which I refused to do. I lost my mom 2/26/2019 and finally felt courageous enough to do this, but the app wouldn't cooperate in any way! Prior to the upgrade I could maneuver my way through perfectly."
"With the latest update (Feb. 2022), the album indexing is broken when it comes to numerical values. Since I label my albums with the format YYYY/MM/DD, they used to index correctly when using the alphabetical sort feature. However, the album order is now scrambled, and it takes me significantly longer to find an album I need to access. Please fix."
Selective tool freezes up the app and my phone. When I'm halfway through editing an unsaved photo it lags a bit then just freezes. It is incredibly annoying and a huge inconvenience. I've closed the app and I've tried restarting my phone and its still an issue. I love the app and its amazing when everything is working properly.
"It's ridiculous to be paying monthly for a premium account and not being able to use the app!!! I have used lightroom for so long, I have a big library and so many presets of my own as well as bought presets.I don't want to cancel my subscription and abandon the app but there is no point to keep paying when I can't even open the app. It crashes before it even opens and asks me to send a feedback (sent dozens).Even before it started crashing, all the thumbnails in the gallery were black. Pls fix!"
"Since the first week of September, my images that I had saved in my library all disappeared. It fixed so now just the latest ones are there. All the others lost. As soon as I start edits the app freezes or shuts down. I have reloaded this app at least 3 dozen times. I have read all the help tips on line that have been from over a year ago. ( didn't need help then). I'm truly disappointed in what was such a great app to an epic failer. *WHY IS WATERMARKING SO HARD NOW?!"
"Does a great job with editing. However, the app constantly crashes! If it keeps doing it, I really don't think I should be paying a monthly fee for it because, I can't use it! Several times now I've spent quite a good amount of time editing, only to have the app crash and my work lost! Please fix!"
IDK what Adobe was thinking when they made this but they weren't thinking about the way serious photographers need to have their software layed out. This is a train wreck. Just about any cheap photo retouching app gets it better than Lightroom does. The problem starts with the file manager. I need real rectangular thumbnails instead of cropped squares. And filenames. It gets worse from there and i don't have the time or space to list everything. Just find something else.
"This app looks so great and user friendly...but it's worthless. I can't tell you about the features, because simply uploading a photo hasn't happened yet. Every time I try, I get the neverending ""loading"" spinning wheel - so the app is quickly sucking down my battery without actually doing anything. After having that experience ten times, I came back to read the reviews to glean some insight - they're mostly negative because this app is garbage. I'll be deleting and looking for something better."
"You need a subscription in order to do even the barest of minimum editing. Ridiculous. I shouldn't be surprised because it's, well, Adobe after all. Do any of those cool tools and features work well? I don't know because you don't get a chance to find out. Seriously, all you can really do is change the colors. Wow. Amazing. Also, the first thing I noticed was that the app feels very slow and importing pictures is a chore. It doesn't feel like a mobile editor at all, maybe, if you have a tablet."
"I know $4.99 is not a lot but I was charged already even though I'm still on a ""free trial"" for premium. I used it once and didn't liked it, so I cancelled my subscription right after and when I looked up my bank account, I was already charged for the whole month and it says that my subscription will end on the 26 of January. I'm not sure how Adobe free trial works. Most apps charge you after your free trial, not during."
"Not everyone has internet all the time. A great on the go solution is made pretty useless by requiring me to have a connection to transfer large files whenever I want to edit. Just allow me to use my storage adobe. The cloud is fine but it doesn't work when you're in remote areas without a readily available connection.,."
"Latest update has bugs that make it unusable! My RAWs look fine in the overview (displays photos w/ edits no prob). But when selecting a shot for viewing, it loads my edits, then skews tint to -106, making my photo super green. Does this on all shots I've edited. Since have no idea what the value was set at previously, I am forced to reset the white balance to it's original state (as shot). Also toggling the drop down that says 'custom' or 'as shot' often doesn't change the WB. Please fix these!"
"CONSTANTLY CRASHING - It freezes up, shows a black screen, kicks me out, sometimes reloads but all for nothing since it will just freeze up again, and when it actually DOES work, then won't export a photo - ""this may take a moment,"" followed by spinning and waiting, then crashing. My device is NOT low on storage, and I have uninstalled and reinstalled, and still no good. I have paid monthly for this app for years and I expect it to WORK - FIX IT PLEASE"
"I LOVE Lightroom on the desktop, BUT I just HATE how this particular lr app crashes so often when im using it. It crashes every minute I swear. I will loose progress most of the time on what i was working on. Sometimes it doesn't even save my work when I try to save it. I would give this app ZERO stars of I could. It's so frustrating and takes 50x longer to edit photos than on the desktop version. If this gets fixed I'll change my review, but honestly this sucks."
"Bring back photoshop touch! All of the new apps are excessive, poorly made, and endlessly frustrating. PSTouch had everything needed to do art, not just selfies. I hate having to switch between several different apps to finish one project. I'd pay to be able to use PSTouch monthly, but I will not pay for any of the new garbage apps Adobe has put out."
"The app will not let me renew my old subscription. I used to love using this app, but due to a credit card cancellation, my subscription automatic payment failed, and my subscription was automatically cancelled. When I went to renew, the subscription price had change from the usual $4.99 plus tax, to $9.99 plus tax and is now including the desktop subscription +storage. The app gives me no way of selecting my old plan that included only mobile access. If this is fixed, I will alter my rating."
"Such a disappointment. I had a galaxy note 8 that this app worked incredible on. Then I got the galaxy note 9 and now the app crashes every time I try to use any type of selection in masking mode. It is so frustrating. 10 out of 10 do not recommend anymore. If I could give zero stars, I would. Edited to add, its not just my phone that it crashes on, I've tried it on my husband's note 9 also and it does the same thing. It says it requires an Android os 6 or higher, mine is OS 10."
"This app is terrible! After signing up I tried to add a picture so I can Photoshop it. After adding the picture it DOESN'T load at all, and 4 minutes later I got a notification saying ""Imported 0 of 1 photos."" It just stays STUCK and doesn't do a ÉÇÊÕ¼ thing! So I waited an extra 9 minutes and it still stays STUCK trying to import. I'm running Android Oreo on a Galaxy S7. This app is garbage"
"Terrible file mgmt. Lost a ton of photos! Do not let LR manage your photo file locations. Move your files manually. LR will lose them. Storage devices don't appear. I just spent hours post processing to find out the next day they were gone & entire albums were missing. How does a photo editing app lose photos & albums after you've spent hours working on them? When it says ""Importing photos..."" it's not. Editing capability is great, but losing photos is bad business. Amateur coders! Try onshore."
Giving this a 2 star review. Everything was fine until tonight. I opened the app and put a photo to edit but then suddenly i can't because there's a text that showed up at the bottom of the screen. It happens manytimes. I even reboot my phone but still. It showed up. I even reinstall the app but it is the same like earlier. This frustrates me much because this is the only app that i used since before. Tell me how to fix this.
"I love lightroom desktop but lightroom mobile has meny downsides which I don't really mind except one. The biggest one. When editing on ipadM2 it defocus(blures) the photo while using adjustment sliders. It makes the process exactly unpleasant for small adjustments, hard to perceive changes. Been using lightroom for two years now."
"Hello, last update make lightroom don't autosave the edited pics. Used to be be just fine, at least for my previous 2 years subscription. Not sure what happened, but after editing the pics go back to original. Really painful after all those editing process and the pics go back like nothing happened."
"Using the app for years and 3 days ago app stopped working properly, I Cannot see any folder options (All Photos, And custom folders I made, I literally cannot edit a photo without any of those options showing, cannot import photos, cannot review photos after using in app camera function, literally the editing tab is blank with nothing displayed, please fix as I tried uninstalling and re-installing 6 times, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra."
Bulk export is abruptly closing in the middle. It's not exporting all photos. I have purchased the app to reduce the editing time but it's no use. Single export is taking apporx.3 minutes. It's really frustrating to use this app..
"Photo editing: Masking, Healing & geometry locked behind a paywall. You can't video edit anything. You need to upgrade to use this feature. The UI isn't friendly. A lot of basic features are missing like collage."
"Disappointed!!! I've been editing the same photos so many times because after while they simply don't appear on the app, and they disappear from gallery too.. I hope you fix that problem of ""Failed to load development version""!!"
I paid for premium and now the app is constantly crashing when I select one to edit. ð­ Can't even click on presets before it black screens and kicks me back to the apps main screen. Didn't have this problem before paying for premium. ð
Unable to edit raw photos taken on phone unless I pay for it. Adding your own presets just long winded. Update: at Adobe as I said you want me to pay for a subscription to edit my own photos taken on phone in raw format.
"Paid version keeps crashing = NOT COOL. My S7+ tablet has more than enough power and space, so it is not my device... you need to fix this Adobe.. UPDATE, they replied to me here and gave me a link for feedback that doesn't work... are you people serious? UPDATE: They fixed the app, it was working great, until the start of March, now it's crashing again and I can't get my editing and exports done. Samsung may be to blame, they updated on March 1st."
"Garbage! Lightroom has been riddled with issues for me since day 1. I've been on with tech support more times than I care to remember. Photos not syncing, panorama mergers looking like a Jackson pollock painting, constant crashes, slowness, the list goes on. How does such a large company like Adobe have such an unreliable product???"
"About the new LRM update, please make the undo button separate from the versions and reset button. It sucks now. Every time even in healing or brushing we have to double tap to undo an action instead of one. It adds up."
"Requires a login to an Adobe account. I get it, you just don't care about my privacy, and just want to compile and sell my data. Easy decision, I'll use a free product that does almost everything as well, and doesn't demand stupid things like an account to edit a simple photograph. Absolutely ridiculous business practice."
"Never been more disappointed with an app as well as customer service. I have never been able to get the app to work properly and so today finally sat down with customer service via their chat. In the period of messaging them for 3 hours (with no resolution) 3 people disconnected from the chat. The app is saying there's a bug and lightroom needs to fix that on their end. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app doesn't fix this. Until this is fixed, I DO NOT recommend lightroom to anyone."
"Probably the single worst photo editing app to date doesn't even support all images types literally downloaded a photo off Google and the app wouldn't recognize it doesn't have the ability to even merge two photos together the quality, inages have to be uploaded manually which again is very annoying, highly suggest anyone to avoid this app and the devs at all costs"
"The recent update seems to be working on premium mode only. Sorry to say, I'm deleting this app. It was great that you guys gave us such huge oppertunity for years as free users. But now that it has got only premium mode, it's no more needed for me. Sorry to say there are tons of free apps to edit."
"This app is starting to annoy me, won't load certain photos, and it keeps crashing before the photo loads. ð¤ I'm going to start looking for alternative photo editors, it's been happening a lot over the last few months."
"It would be great if I could export my photos to my SD card. I'm not going to waste my time exporting a file at a time then manually moving it to my SD card. It would also be great if I could use it without creating an account. If I wanted to pay for it I could see the option of having an account. Edit: yes, don't respond about the non-functional ability to export to SD card. Still uninstalled as it is not usable."
"It's fraudulent to be not able to view the Trial subscriptions anywhere in your App. Ok, then it redirects to Google Play app under the Subscriptions tab and it doesn't show Lightroom's subscription. Opting to Try for a week and â¹4,400/Year is about to be active in a day and I want to cancel. Good job! I'm gonna keep the target bank account free of Rupees!"
"Haven't used it, but the thing that bother me is that it will import from the gallery and duplicate all photos, now my memory on the phone carry duplicate files giving me storage issues. HOW NOT TO IMPORT ALL PHOTOS, ONLY THE ONES YOU WANT TO EDIT."
"I don't like the subscription system. There are free good alternatives. But if you want raw edittting of photos thar taken by dslr, there is no alternative on the store. Edit: 2023 and we still don't have proper ai tools. Eraser tool is like a joke compared to what other ai tools can do"
"I switched devices, and since switching to a new better phone my lightroom does not show the select sky or select subject option anymore in the masks. Very disappointing. I am still logged into my subscription but lacking lots of features."
"Worked well, and used it an all my photos, however, after most recent update I cannot upload any photos to the app as app notifies that there is a bug and have to wait developers to fix it and yes, I have reinstalled the app. Hopefully this will be fixed asap as I am paying for the app"
"Can't export photos in full size to other sites like Flickr, only max 2048 pixels widest. You can do full size on the iOS version (it lets you choose best/full size or small), why not on Android?"
"How I wish I can rate this a 0 star. I used to love this editor for years until this year 2023 , month of Marchâ I was shocked and frustrated after discovering all my OWNED PRESETS are gone. Days later, I calm myself and tried to download and create a presets once again, in just a dayâ my NEWLY MADE PRESETS ARE GONE AGAIN. It happened for the 3rd time now. It frustrates me, gotta cancel my subscription."
One of the worst apps in terms of stability. Crashes very often under heavy use. Still the best photo editing app on android so you have to make do with the crushing. This is the worst developed app on my phone. I still have to use it because of my job as a photographer. The bugs are unbelievable. This app now crashes every minute. My phone is Xiaomi 11T Pro.
Keep getting an error message saying that edit wont be applied because i need to go back and edit photo on original device that i edited the photo on in the first place. Well my phone was the original device yet im getting these messages on my phone..
"I've purchased after it expired now. Even though I've subscribed and been charged, it's still saying EXPIRED. And I got disconnected from support. I need this fixed. I even sent the receipt to support this is crazy."
Hey would help if you could CANCEL auto sync. CANNOT export any of my edits because this ******* app is busy syncing all my raw photos to the cloud. Never even asked to do this. Garbage.
"Since the last update, mobile and desktop app has not been working the entire week. All my photos in my gallery are all gone and screen keeps being stuck in loading mode. I used to love this app, but now I can't use it. Already tried uninstalling and re-installed multiple times. Very disappointed."
"I can't cancel the subscription, whenever I go to the Adobe website to cancel it says go to the Samsung store since I purchased it through Samsung, when I look at my plans on the website it says I have no subscriptions currently. I'm on the free trial currently so maybe I have to wait until it's over to cancel???"
It's sad and frustrating how much this app crashes smh especially when I pay for it every month for years...this is a major problem we keep putting in the reviews over and over again!
"Its so bad recently not loading photo library, crashs on large files from s23 ultra has problems with saving files , recently always have black screen and after that i need to restart app anoying experience"
I just updated from free to premium and it's crashing everytime I open it. It was fine when it was free. I feel cheated after paying money.
Worst experience... I bought premium membership but it is not at all useful... it's better to use without premium.... if there will be free trial or one day premium... atleast my that much money will not waste upon it
This is the worst app ever compared to others where you get all this features for free. You have to pay to use this nonsense. Won't recommend downloading its a waste of time
"I have been trying to login this application since 7 days and everytime it shows "" an error occurred while authenticating please try again later."" Please fix this"
Was working fine but today photos cannot load in app. Tried restarting and clearing cache and data. Now lost 3 days worth of pictures. And these pictures were taken during travel.
Adobe claims a mixed experience being able to transition between desktop & mobile but it's been my experience that the syncing isses are such a plague that it makes it impossible. I've lost so much work having to redo it because of syncing issues that I'm giving up and I'm only to going to be sticking to my desktop for all my photo editing.
Couldn't subscribe monthly. The gmail password I entered is incorrect. Although I'm very sure its the correct one. I confirmed my gmail many times
"Cant create account, processing only. Trying twice still the same. Finally, stay with photoshop express."
"To everyone, please be careful when you want to subscribe for ""free trial"" because it's just gimmick. I subscribed for the 7 days free trial but cancelled it immediately after subscription since the app didn't have what I was looking for. But I was charged for the subscription. When I contacted lightroom they asked me to refer to Google and Google refused to refund saying it's within their policy. Such fraudulent partners."
"The app is titled ""Lightroom Photo & VIDEO Editor"", but video editing is a premium feature you have to pay a subscription for. Very misleading."
The only thing this app is good for is charging you after it's been cancelled and unused. And if you think your going to get tech support forget it. If the automated service doesn't understand you it will hang up on you and if you try to call back from the same number it will just keep hanging up on you ð also it's slow and full of bugs.
My app just updated and now I've lost access to 6000 edited photos and many presets. Brilliant.
"Adobe, as a company, should be 0/5 stars. Continuing to use LR feels like Stockholm Syndrome. I strongly, strongly recommend using an alternative. Hey Adobe, how about you bring back the ability to select subject for masking? It was on the app, and you took it away. You took away lots of good stuff that should be included in this version. Every time I have to call customer service, I get transferred from department to department in circles endlessly - and they're all absolutely useless."
Awesome good color adjustment but that is all you apparently get with the free app. To even have cut and paste you have to have 39.99 / year version. I won't even keep it long enough to find out if I might want to have a version I'm paying for
"I paid $10.99 for the premium, yet am I not able to edit my video, using effects?! If those things such as texture, clarity in etc are only photo, then don't include video. I wasted 11 dollars on it. This is ridiculous."
These people are stealing my money. I signed up for one month and they won't allow me to cancel. I've had this for over a year now and they still say they'll fine me if I cancel. I don't use the app and I can't afford to keep paying for it. I never agreed to keep it for more than a month. I can't find a contact number for support. I even cancelled my card but somehow they got the new card details. NEVER give Adobe your bank details. They are worse than most criminals.
The app keeps crashing and it tells me it's because it has a bug and that I'll need to update it when the developers create a new update. Please fix this soon cause I need this for my work!
"I love this app, but since I got my S23 Ultra it's not working anymore, the photos just don't sync up. Please, correct that."
"I've purchased the app and overall it's good.But selecting a photo is a real challenge. For example I have 800 photos and I need to surf through all of that hounded photos to find the one I want to edit. Search doesn't work correctly, can't view by folders. Only by date and useless filters. Please make UX easy for finding a photo"
I have purchased monthly pack of 170 inr .. but I can't edit raw image yet.. please help it's showing in my account that I don't have any subscription package but I have paid 170inr this morning only. Plz help
"Not working, i uploaded 3 photos and it didn't show in the album, then i closed the app but it's icon was showing in the upper screen, then I restarted my phone and everything deleted, my album my ""all photos"" option, when i created a new album it was not creating. Then i reinstalled the app and lost all my presets! FIX THIS!"
i really dont like it when i download a cool looking app and im hit with a price i have to pay to simply heal a spot on my photo. and i absolutely love the annual price of 49.99.... i dont edit enough to pay that thanks bye
"This has been a great app for some time now, in fact my favorite ... but this latest update has completely ruined it! It takes forever to load and when I finally open a movie, it buffers every 2-3 minutes! Very frustrating. I tried uninstalling, reinstalling, rebooting my tablet several times, etc ... all to no avail. How is that a better app? Sadly, I've uninstalled tubi and now trying freevee, but there's no comparison. Please let us know when you fix this. I miss my tubi! Thank you!"
Had to delete. I used to love Tubi but now i cant even get through a movie without ads playing literally (without exaggeration) every 45 seconds. To top it off they were the same 3 three 30 second ads every time. So 1.5 minutes of ads every 45 seconds of a movie was the deal breaker for me. Would have been nice to at least be able to watch a scene in its entirety before an ad. I get thats how they keep it free while gaining revenue but its seriously overkill.
"First time using this on my new tablet... While the movie played perfectly all the way thru, at the end the app and tablet completely froze except for the audio of the next auto-played movie that I did not want, and could not exit the app unless I simultaneously long pressed power and volume buttons to reset the tablet. Very much not cool. Which proves my long held belief that it is always best to purchase the dvd instead of streaming. Guess I won't be using this anymore then."
Used to work great. Haven't opened the app in a month or 2. Now it won't play anything except trailers. I keep getting an oops that didn't work. Tried deleting the cache and storage. Then deleted the app and downloaded it again and it still doesn't work. It was good while it lasted I guess. 4-5-23 edit: deleted. Still can't get the app to do anything and no response from developers.
Anytime there's a commercial Tubi stops and doesn't come back and you have to get out of the app and hit resume video. It doesn't just happen on one TV and happens on two TVs in my house. I have tried to do a Force-stop and load the app. I have Uninstalled the app and reloaded the app. Nothing fixes this issue. I'm using an Amazon fire stick in both cases but it also seems to happen on the application on my phone. Please help I will say it worked better before the update.
"Absolutely horrible since the last update. Horrendous. It doesn't even open anymore. Update: it worked for two days. Now it's crashed again and none of the shows are opening, not even the series/show menu. Update: now it doesn't open at all. Needs a major update!! Edit: still nothing opens."
"I used to like watching my favorite vintage 1970s series, ""The Rockford Files,"" on Tubi. Recently, it seems Rockford is no longer available on the Tubi phone app. I do notice that the series is still on the Tubi app for my TV, but, frankly, that does not suit my interests. I plan to uninstall the Tubi app from my phone if this issue cannot be resolved. Only one star."
"That sound, with now the dumb-looking rabbit that comes on when you turn on the app, is so ANNOYING!! And it SUCKS that you have to resign in with a pass word, if you update the app!!! No other app does that!! A lot of movies are the ""bottom of the barrel"" type from the 70s, 80s and 90s. With small TV screen cover, instead of FULL screen! Also when you try and fast forward a movie or something else, it will sometimes cause what you are watching to turn off!!! ðð¤¬ð"
The movies will continue playing in the background even though you paused it to switch to another app. You have to completely close the app down if you need the video to stop playing so you can make a call or switch to another app. And now a banner place across the movie advertising other movies. Not sure how I'm supposed to watch one movie when there's an ad in front of it the whole time.
I've contacted Tubi. I've tried to get the matter resolved. They're either unwilling or unable. 6 and 8 ads each break? 5 to 10 mins of ads?? Every 7 mins??? They wrote me back saying it was 2-3 mins of ads every 15 mins. That may be the standard but that's not what's happening. In 2 instances so far the same ad played 4 times or more in a row! I don't need your argument. I need you to fix the dang problem!
"Quickly becoming one of the most garbage streaming services, right up with YouTube. It went from 2 or 3 ads here and there to 6 and 7 ads, 5 minutes of ads every 12 minutes and god forbid if you rewind to hear the previous sentence, you'll have to watch all of the ads again. They are starting to give YouTube a run for their money with the shear volume of ads. Garbage."
"Don't fall for the old bait & switch. This will seem to be an awesome app for a day or two, just long enough for you to tell your friends it's a great app. Then you get downgraded to the ""Gotcha!"" version. At first you get a brief commercial before some shows & movies, sometimes none at all. After that your shows will be repeatedly interrupted for multi-commercial chunks. The timing is STOOPIT popping up when a character has his mouth open speaking. No skip. Gotta hear the diarrhea song again..."
"I was in the middle of a movie (Sleepy Hollow) and the app stopped working. I had to close it and reopen it numerous times to get it to work again, only to find that the movie I was watching, along with about 90% of the movies that were in my list, had completely disappeared from the app. Edited to add: Watching a different movie. 2-3 minutes worth of ads every 10 minutes for the ENTIRE 2 hour movie. Awesome."
"A good selection of movies. Great for the deaf or hearing impaired as closed captions are automatically displayed on all movies for which they are available. Unfortunately they are WAY too distracting if you don't need them. Found 4 step instructions to block them but couldn't actually make that work, so, deleted the whole app. Since most people don't actually need cc it might be better to make ""none"" the standard option or put in a simple on/off switch. Or send me a new brain to do it."
"I'm really sorry, but I just changed this rating from a five star to a one star! The reason is due to the fact that I keep getting the same STEM ad over and over again! When I try to watch something there always has to be a air freshener ad!! I try watching my favorite movie but when I leave the app the next day with the video still on the video begins to turn black! It's annoying because then I have to back into the app just to go back on to my progress! Horrible app if you don't like ads! Sad."
"This app is infuriating!!! I have internet, and it's taken me minutes to even look at the cover of a movie! Don't even get me started on the search option! I've tried to look up a movie, and it continued loading. I've had tubi on my TV before, and thats where it's best. On the phone, it barely even works. Don't get this app if you aren't patient enough to wait 10 minutes just to see what is available."
"Don't bother with this one, the developers are dishonest. It's ad supported because it's free, so when it cut to one a few minutes into the film, it was jarring, but expected. I hit the ""back"" button and a message said the movie would return after two ads. I endured both, but a third started. I hit ""back"" to try and escape the extra ad, and a fourth started, and a message then said the film would continue after three ads. The app can't even keep it's scams straight. Don't waste your time."
I had tubi on my last phone and it worked great but on my new phone it doesn't play the movies right. They don't play smoothly. The picture and the sound are chopped up. It makes watching a movie impossible. I really hope it's fixable because I really like this app when it's working. It's now a few weeks later and it still doesn't work. I used to watch movies on your app all the time. This sucks! Please fix!
Same old thing I guess. Too many commercials are just dead minutes with stupid music playing. It freezes and possibly skips Parts when it unfreezes. Makes it totally unable to watch anything. I know you're working behind the scenes to make it better. LOL. But something tells me y'all can work a lot harder to make it better without adding a ton of commercials or ads or whatever you want to call them. Thank you have a nice day
"I would say that the app has a good variety of movies, but they are all B-rate and subpar. The UI is very nice and easy to interface without any inconsistencies. However, the ""vast"" movie selection feature movies that at least I have not come across once if at all. This can be an amazing app if more relevant movies are added."
"The content is great! I'm rating this app lower because of the amount of ads. I'm currently trying to watch a movie that is supposed to be 1 hour and 55 minutes. It is difficult though because literally every 15 minutes there are 3 to 4 ads that last approximately 5-7 minutes total which interrupt the progress....sometimes in the middle of a character's sentence. I do understand that this the way that apps are funded, but really?!?!?! Every 15 minutes?!?!?! OMGOODNESS!!!!!!"
"Horrible app!!!! If I could give this no starring would. It took me 3 days to watch a 90 minute movie because of all the lagging. It only plays a few seconds before it stops. Then when it plays if you're lucky, it will only go back a few seconds instead of starting all over. I thought it was doing it because of a lot of traffic due to holiday weekend but Netflix and Hulu play fine. If it continues after this weekend, the app is gone. If it starts acting fine after, I will change my review."
"The constant commercials interrupt the way the video plays and always messes up the feed. Constant loading issues after the commercials play, you can never finish a movie. It's got a lot of bugs. The only reason I try to use it every now and then is, it does have alot of good movies that I wish I could finish watching. Also, 3 ads in the first 13 minutes, really?! And then after they're done, the movie then skips and stops to load or stops casting altogether. So Annoying, had to uninstall."
"The numerous ads themselves are not even the problem; while casting movies to my tv, the ads freeze up continuously and take forever while the speech sounds like a garbled robot voice. The movies sound like a broken record player on repeat, scenes and dialect play over & again. This is a terrible app so far but I cannot find my favorite movies for free elsewhere. Not sure yet if it's worth it. Probably will pay to watch the same movies from a better quality app"
"It's okay, way to many back to back adds every 10 minutes. And every time adds pop up they're long and most of the time play twice in a row. Really annoying to say the least. Most films are low budget, some just have poor quality. Overall though cant complain for having access to free movies and shows, But needs major updates, especially the adds part!"
This app has serious flaws in the quality of playing content. There seems to be a problem with looping to where it almost seems like the rewind button is pressed for a few seconds and movies repeat seceral sconds of footage over several times. The other issue i have is the amount of advertisements there are. I could see a high frequency of commercial breaks in a popular and in high demand movie but there is tons of advertising even in old and unpopular movies.
"Would be great if some major problems were fixed. If it's playing on your TV it does not pause playing to check if you're still there out of courtesy, like Netflix and Hulu do. This can cause an entire show to be marked as watched. This problem is worse with Tubi then it may seem. When an episode of a series is marked as watched its frustrating and even impossible on some devices to start the episode over from the beginning because it automatically skips to the next one without a way to stop it"
Have been using for a couple of years and has always been great until about a month ago. Now it takes forever to load even the main page. Trying to watch something gets interrupted w a black screen and forever loading page. Ready to uninstall it since i can't watch anything. Sucks! It used to run smoothly and worked very well. Never had problems till all of the sudden! Disappointing! Went from 5 star to no star
"Uninstalled after finding out you cannot do anything else on your phone while using the app to watch a show. I never just watch a show even on tv. I'm always multi tasking. You can watch a show & do something else if you use the website as it will shrink down to the corner, but 1/2 the time the screen blacks out (ex: read a text, play a game, read news, etc) then you have to log out & reload the site ....sometimes more than once."
Does not work good. Having issues using this app on a smart TV. Every time the ads end the screen goes black and stays black while what was being watched is playing in the background. No matter what I try or how many times I exit the app it doesn't fix the issue. Its all at random chance if it'll start working again. I have no issues with any other streaming apps that are ran on my smart TV.
"This app has been going downhill for a while now. And now, you end up watching more commercials than the movie you intended to watch! Then, on top of that, they advertise movies that are totally expired, but you dont know that until you contact customer service and they give you some idiotic directions and make you feel like its your fault!! So i decided right then and there to delete the app! Besides, they don't really have any edge over Netflix or Amazon Prime anymore...they lost it!!"
"I think the app is broken... I can open it but it never plays for more than 5-10 mins before it completely freezes. I thought it was pretty decent up until the last update, seems to be garbage like the other free apps now. If they were to fix the streaming problems I would give 4 stars only because of the low grade movies that are offered. Update - 12/3/19 App works for longer duration but skips back and forward for no reason... Makes trying to enjoy a movie or show very irritating."
"I'd been looking for a free & safe app for movies & series and was thrilled when I heard about tubi TV. I was starting to enjoy all it offers, until everything I try to watch started to continuously skip or lag--which never happens w/anything I watch on YouTube or Netflix. If/when they ever fix that very annoying issue, I will gladly give it 5 stars... until then, it sucks right now."
"I can't understand why on earth, the last update was a total and complete failure! I was okay with all the constant commercial's over the past 8 months or so but why can't I get past the frick'n trailers, in order to watch any of the movies, nor can I hear the trailers. I can also see from reading many of the other reviews, that I'm certainly not the only one that's experiencing this problem! It seems to a glitch in your upload system! That many people shouldn't be ignored. Looks like it could be the beginning of the end, of a good App."
"Pretty bad to be honest. All they had are old, obscure, and b-list movies. Want to find a specific movie or show? This isn't the app for you. I searched for about 12 different shows and movies from the 80's and 90's, nothing, just some out of copyright stuff that you can find on any other website. If they have something modern it is very limited and usually bad. I would much rather recomend something like ShowBox if you want to watch actual shows and movies."
This app would be great but it loads every 5 seconds. i havent been able to watch a movie yet. There is a great movie selection but the loading is so aggravating that ive stopped trying to watch movies. This really needs to looked into. I have Netflix also and have no problems. Hopefully this can be fixed asap!!!!
"I used to love this app and had rated it 5 stars, but now it has become useless to me bcuz everytime i start watching a movie, when the ads come on they freeze and will not allow me to continue with my movie. I have tried updating, reinstall, etc...nothing works. I would give 0 stars if i could but unfortunately I had to put 1. If this issue is not fixed soon I will uninstall completely!"
"At first you can find some good movies on here but they need to step it up a bit when it comes to adding movies. For the first time I tried to watch a series. What a nightmare. Every single time you try to pick up where you left off you must start at the very beginning of the episode, if not the entire season. No thanks. Yes it's free but it has it's, (very loud) commercials to fund it. Liked it at first but it's truly more worth it to pay few bucks for Netflix, Hulu, Amazon etc."
"I found a few excellent alternatives to TUBI and I'm very saddened thatâas loyal as I was, plus having convinced literally dozens of people to try itâeven with 2 emails clearly asking for help as I am disabled, which I always point out, Tubi never responded back! Nothing has been done; apparently the changed preview process of which I speak doesn't affect all platforms. PLEASE: change it back or allow us the option to change the preview to the original & not just the film's first 45 seconds!"
"This app has lots of shows and movies to offer...I am enjoying the movie Dancing at The Blue Iguana. Only problem is, this movie pauses alot on my device and doesn't let me watch it all the way. I was trying to give it a thumbs up, but instead read a thumbs down. Please fix this problem and improve the delay in your movies. Thank you"
"Samsung s7 active, crashes my UI and my phone overheats and I have to wait 5 minutes before it can be rebooted or even responds. my family uses this service on every device in the house. I'd like to be able to use it when I'm on the road since I can't drive and being a passenger just sucks when the driver wants country music. fix this and I will change to 5 stars!!!!"
"I was very surprised by the variety, and the lack of ads. However, I can't be bothered to watch anything because when I try it skips like a horrible scratched up DVD. If I had a DVD that skipped this bad, id break it out of anger and throw it away, I'm sad there is no relief I can have by breaking it enless I break my whole phone, and that just won't do. I hope the problem is fixed because I would love to use the app and give it a good review."
"This App was great until the most recent update. There's now buffering issues, but more importantly it's no longer saving what you were watching so you can't continue watching where you left off and the ""My Stuff"" option is no longer working. I uninstalled and reinstalled, but it didn't fix the issue. Please fix this or eliminate the recent update."
"After the April 5th update the app is even worse than it was on my critic from April 4th. I really just want to read a synopsis of a movie or t.v. show without complications. The screen freezes but audio still goes, the movie or t.v. show will start playing without prompting it to do so & I can't even read what a show or movie is about when I click on the indicated picture. When something isn't broken to begin with don't fix it. These updates are absurd & truly frustrating to navigate around."
"Others have said what im about to repeat. I enjoy watching my favorite shows and movies however lots of ads / commercial breaks which is fine, in fact its pretty similar to watching regular TV. The biggest issue is signing in and out for a day or two with no issue and then not being able to sign in at all and also receiving the DMR error 2001 code in the middle of viewing content not to mention buffering during a show, movie or a ad / commercial break all while being connected to Wi-Fi."
"I can honestly that I made a mistake downloading this app. Thinking it was as good as Netflix, I decided to give it a try. I was wrong. Every time I tried to play a movie, there was an ad video popping and forcing you to watch it once every five minutes. It became extremely annoying and frustrating. Are you trying to give your customers actual movies to watch or a million ad videos? I can't even tell. I'm extremely disappointed. I'll stick to Netflix."
"Every good, Non B-list movie I want to watch tells me that the title I have chosen is unavailable at this time. But if you look into it, in Tubi's help center in the FAQ's, it states that it means these titles are unavailable in your region, but if you live in the United states then all titles are available to watch. Well, I've lived in Pennsylvania my entire life, and its definitely where I am trying to watch these movies, and the app wont let me... last I checked, PA. is still a state!ð"
"Until about 2 weeks ago this app was 4 stars because it always forgets where you are and you have to search back through the seasons to find what episode you are on. Now, before you can start watching, you have to watch between 2 and 3 minutes of commercials. If you grab the wrong episode, another set of commercials. Even worse, it's been having issues playing in the last few days, but no problem playing commercials. IE commercials, error, start over, commercials, error, startover."
"I evidently have trust issues. There is an update for this program, but no indication of what the update is for. I don't trust programs/developers that provide updates without any explanation as to what the update is fixing, changing or providing. Makes me wonder what they are trying to possibly sneak in. Now I have to decide if I need to remove the program from my device and move on to another, similar program, that is more open with the users."
"I think your time would be better spent stepping in dog poop than have this app because I tried to look up a lot of my favorite tv shows & movies and 99% of the shows and movies that I expected to show up came up with different results; for example, when I typed in ""Cars"" it just showed me all the kiddy versions that are for 1 year olds. So if you think getting this app is a dream come true, it really feels like eating a plate full of poop, so I wouldn't recommend getting this app."
Buffering is an issue you should work on guys. It's not bad as some other apps but it's bad enough to irritate. The heck with writing a review. This is a direct message to the devs. Fix the buffering!!!! It's difficult to watch a movie or TV show with 4 seconds of playtime and 20-30 seconds of buffering. . In fact at this time I'm looking for another app to use because this one now sucks
"Its very aggravating trying to watch anything on tubi. Every 10 seconds or so it'll freeze to buffer, no matter if im on my data or wifi. The selection of titles is excellent but trying to watch them is a challenge. I'd also like to note that both my wifi and mobile data have good strong signal so the issue has to be in the appointment"
"Please get some dubbed options and please add a way to remove stuff from the continue watching bar. You don't advertise if something is in english, so I try watching something only to never watch it again because I can't understand it. It's really annoying. And adding three minute, unskippable ads every five minutes is the worst. I'd probably get rid of the app for that reason alone. I get ads are how you make it free for users, but is there a way to get less ads while I'm watching something."
"I've heard good things about it... But it just refuses to work. I'm on the newest Android OS, have good internet, and have restarted my phone and reinstalled the app multiple times. Every single time I try to watch a show or movie it just goes into a black screen of neverending buffering."
"The app required that I sign in manually, even though it previously signed me in automatically. When I did so, all of my saved films were gone. I know that some films are removed when rights expire, but everything? Meanwhile, others that I had never searched for, viewed, or saved were there. The website FAQ/troubleshooting page is just a bunch of nonworking links. There are a list of issues, but, no matter which you click on, it says ""Page Not Found""."
The biggest problem for me that ended up being an ultimate deal breaker was that after 7 days the movies in your list completely get taken off of the site. This is a huge deal for me. Right now a horror movie I had been watching is now completely unavailable so my options are to get the movie elsewhere. Uninstalling right now. That 'feature' is what ticked me all the way off. One star isn't enough. Trash.
"I used to love this app an incredible amount. It was one of the easiest ways for me to access 70s and 80s horror movies. They were all mostly old, but fiercely loved obscure films.Unfortunately, I can't say I feel the same about Tubi today. Recently, they have continued to add more and more modern movies from the past five years, but have not added any old horror movies in months! I once was able to find old hidden gems here. Now, its just senseless flops. Please fix this issue!!"
"I watched one movie. 1!!! Now this app is complete shÂ¡+!! Try to watch another movie go to a black screen it lags and freezes my screen. When it does play the movie all I get is audio. Close the app same thing. Delete and reinstall the same thing happens again! Super annoying!! Ya'll need to get this figured out! Lag, play audio, lag, lag, lag, lag. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"
"It use to play ads every 20 minutes. Now I don't even want to continue using the app anymore do to the excessive amount of ads that plays every 10 minutes. And to make things worse, it freezes during the ads. What's next, spending more time on watching ads than watching movies? Tubi, you have really done it!!!ð¡"
Ads are fine. The app interface is awful. Who requires horizontal scrolling on a phone in portrait mode... An idiot that's who. Doesn't save any user data maybe if you sign up but why would I sign up for an app that cant even get subtitles to work. No next feature. Just all around a failure. I'll watch my show through other means.
"Ad interruptions are far more frequent now, and longer than when I first downloaded it, . Maybe ads are infrequent and brief at first to ""suck you in,"" then increased later. They're being spaced so that toward the end of a movie an ad interruption occurs from five minutes to even ***one minute*** before a show or movie's credits begin, destroying the final scene. They occur at random, often in the middle of a spoken sentence or action shot. Even free, no longer really worth it."
"When I try to watch a movie on my tv, at the end of the ad the app shuts down, and when I go in to reload the movie and hit resume, I get another ad break within 3 minutes and it shuts down again. Barely 25 minutes into my movie and watched 18 minutes worth of ads... this app makes me appreciate dvds so much more now."
"To the developers of this app. This app is having problems like pauses, buffering, stuttering, slight freezes, etc streaming on WiFi viewing any videos on the ""Moto G Stylus 5G"" smartphone (by Motorola). Yes I've tried many solutions and their needs to be an update for the Android version of this app that would address this problem especially if this is happening for some of the other smartphones that's already available. Any other smartphone that I used runs this app with no streaming problems."
This was a good app when i download it a year ago. Now when i try to watch a movie it always play back the scenes it doubles back or play backs the scenes twice. I am tired of this snd so ready to uninstall it. Its a shame with all the good movies that is offered you cant watch because of this playback double scenes errors. What happened??? I cannot give a good review with this aggravating problem going on. I wish u would fix please.
"Once playing, the screen shows the banner the entire time. I can't rewatch an episode. It shuts off after a show instead of plays next. Couldn't pause. Ads make it ship to next episode or movie. I have no clue where all the good reviews are coming from but they must have been paid to rate. This thing sucks bad!"
"It was good at first, but then it keeps minimizing the screen, but when it plays ads it doesn't. And it will sometimes even stop showing subtitles when watching a movie. I stopped using this app and wont use it until I see some improvement, and dont even bother about holding your breath. Tubi is not worth it anymore."
have been using this app for almost 3 years now i think. i loved it at first it always played well and casted just fine. but now it skips back and forth during shows and movies it just stops working during ads and goes to a black screen. reported these problems was told the basic check settings and reinstall and if its still happening its probably my device. i guess all 4 of our devices suck then.
"I'm writing a second review and leaving a new rating. Before my first review, this app worked perfectly fine. Now, it seems to have a buffering issue. When I'm watching a movie it pauses every 2-10 seconds. Its very annoying. Please fix this ASAP. I would love to leave a better review once this issue is addressed. Thank You."
"I had the app for about an hour before I deleted it. the selection of movies and shows they have Is awful, and I had only ever heard of a few of the movies. I was searching for 20 minutes straight, and couldn't find a single Disney movie. they don't have shows like the hunger games, American dad, the simpsons etc. I would personally rather pay for Netflix than use this crummy app."
"Complete b.s. It claims that it has all kinds of popular movies and just a couple of ads when in reality most of the movies on there ard obscure and frankly some ive never heard of and they are all of quality that is low accordingly. Watching any movie, the ads are pervasive, long, and at times in which there really is no transition but just slapped in the middle of whats going on."
Everytime I download this app it gives me problems. I have downloaded it on at least 6 different phones and everytime. It doesn't want to play anything it doesn't show any pictures or trailers or pictures with the movie title and then you try and just open the movie that you want to see and you get that circle that keeps going around and around so I will be uninstalling this app and telling all my friends to not download it and go download Pluto TV because I don't have any problems with that
"The commercials are tolerable. The picks of movies is good, too good. I don't think I'll live long enough to see all the films I want to see,even all the best comedy stars and shows history completes through films tubi has just for you. I'm used to decorum in such a place for complaining but I've been trying for about two months to get ""MY"" TUBI to download in my new phone, but no it just goes through the motions but gets stuck in load mode ."
"Impossible to set up! I'm stuck at the stupid ""better know you screen"" It's IMPOSSIBLE to scroll through the genre of movies if you try to install the app on an Android tv box! You could at least give the option to skip it. Can you imagine being bared from entering a store until you said if you prefer pasta or chicken! Not even one star!"
"Depending on how you back out or pause, when you want to continue watching, you can't find ""Continue Watching"" or ""the actual movie"" anywhere on the site. Also, at the end of a movie, if you pic a new one at the bottom of the screen, you cant read the write up or see the previews. New trailer plays before you even have time to see what the name of the movie is. Same commercial 2 twice in the same break. Come on you idiots. I wouldn't pay any attention to any of them. Uninstalled !!!"
"I love the abundance of movies a lot of them mainstream. What I don't like is i may watch half a movie and return to watch the other half and it is gone from my queue, yet another which I never clicked on is there to take it's place. The navigation is horrible. Would gladly give 5 stars if these problems are fixed."
"STILL NOT FIXED! Your updates have again caused the same 2 issues: 1) The back 10sec & forward 10sec stops working at some point in the movie & the only way to get them to work again is to close your app, reopen it & find & start playing the movie again. 2) Some movies do not allow me to see their info before I play them, nor to go back & look at the info in the middle of the movie (after stopping it, of course) or even at the end. Why can't u do updates without these occurring again & again?"
"Not only will the app not cast on to anything else, Everytime I think I find a movie that might actually entertain me, it starts with an unnecessarily long ad((I have no problem with ads buy when they're over a minute long each time, 3-4 times randomly throught out the movie you need to just stop)) then buffers for another 5-10 minutes then the app straight up just crashes. I had high hopes for you Tubi. And you failed me."
"Between the movies so bad even syfy would be ashamed and the absolutely grotesque number of ads, you're better off watching paint dry. Of course this app wouldn't be complete without functionality issues. The ""continue watching"" doesn't work and restarts whatever you were watching and trying to jump forward causes the same problem. Fix that and maybe ease up on the ads a bit and the occasional hidden gem might make this service worth it."
"Ads are not too intrusive and the shows are a nice choice for my tastes. Sadly, security must be terrible. Even changing my passwords doesn't stop someone accessing my account. Beware of these breaches they can't seem to stop. No one else has access on my end. Contacting support has been unsuccessful."
"This app has the worst user interface experience I have ever seen, I would give it 0 stars if I could. And they have such limited selection it's ridiculous. I was on YouTube trying to watch Roseanne, there was a link to this app so I went through 10 minutes or more trying to figure out how to navigate through the install and search only to find that they don't even have the show. This app is the worst, and another thing by signing in with my Facebook account they got a free advert plug."
"There are either no ads or never-ending ads. The movies are generally terrible and can be found completely for free elsewhere (cyrose). I liked this app at first. Then the ads became more and more ridiculous in frequency and duration. At this rate, eventually there wont even be a movie ... just ads. I wouldn't recommend this app at all! It's budget Netflix sponsered by Tide every 1 to 12 minutes. Embarrassingly crappy."
"Thought this app was going to be a hidden gem till I watched my first movie on it. 2 1/2hr movie ended up being 3hr movie cause it kept skipping & jumping a few seconds back & forth. Kind of anticlimactic when a suspenseful movie cuts randomly jumps around & skips a few seconds. Did this somewhere around 30-40 times. I have great internet & the image quality was consistent the whole movie, has to be their servers. On that note, I could NEVER watch a movie like that again, was driving me insane!!"
"95% dysfunctional 5% slow. This service really needs some work on fluid streaming services, especially for smart tv's. I couldn't go 5 episodes of anything without it erroring out, and that's when I initially got on it for the first time, and it's only gotten worse over time. I'm lucky if I can even log into it at all without some ""apologetic"" message saying they're looking for something for you. If I make it past that, nothing ever loads and trying to watch anything only yields ""no resource"""
"EDITED AGAIN: I dropped my rating to 1 star because 3 long commercial breaks within 15 mins is ridiculous and seems more than cable. I get thats how bills are paid, but this is excessive. EDITED: I dropped my review to 2 stars because the commercials are now coming too often (every 5-7 mins) and last too long. I like the selection of quality movies, but I left cable because of commercials. If Tubi doesn't cut back on the commercials I will leave this app as well. Previous rating was 5 stars. Sad"
"Horrible!! You can't watch a movie without out skipping constantly.. like a scratched dvd, it skips then replays the seen you just watched over again then goes back to where you should be then skips again... does it about every 10 minutes thru the whole movie, not to mention the ads sucks, may as well watch a movie that has commercials every 20 minutes! Uninstalled it!"
"I freaking HATE that when the ads ome on, you have to bring the screen front and center and let it take over the whole phone until the ad is over. I like to do other stuff on my phone and have the show playing in the background, but it goes to black and won't play one more secobd until you make the ad full screen. This is RIDICULOUS."
The movies have sound but no picture. None and it's frustrating because it was a pretty good app prior to thisI uninstaller it and did almost everything else that I either know or looked up to no avail! It's not my phone either. This is my second phone having the other one stolen a couple of weeks ago so I have different carriers but the same issue???
"Constant issues with payback, movies switching by themselves in the middle and just starting a new movie out of the blue, skipping backwards or forwards 10 or 15 seconds without warning all by itself, playing an ad through my phone when it's casting to the TV and no way to see or turn the ad off blaring out of my phone. I reported all of these apps and did get customer service back which I was already impressed with but there was no follow-through and no solutions Good luck to y'all"
"This streaming program sucks! There is some shows I like on there but there's many ripoffs of popular movies. I like how there's live TV though. I don't like how it says ""Find your next rabbit hole"" and then a cursed rabbit pops out of the hole. And, I hate the layout! And for some shows that appear on YouTube with their own channel like ""Talking Tom & Friends"" is out of order. Like, S1 E6 is S1 E2!! This app may look good in the outside but it's horrible."
"Good at first, only one or two ads per movie or episode. Now, it's overloaded with ads, to the point it's not worth watching! I'm ok with ad-based, free platforms so long as it's a REASONABLE number of ads. Tubi has tripled it's ad content. It's become as ad-heavy as Google. It's the platform providers that drive the pirating industry by being so unreasonable with ad content."
"Started glitching where it cycles out than rewinds the entire movie I'm watching. Won't do anything to fix it! Also, deletes movies from my watchlist constantly, playback feature never works! Do not trust this app!"
"Internal error has been bugging me for a long time, and it's been that way for months. It used to be a good app to play videos that you can't find anywhere else, but this constant internal error is happening across all devices, including the fire stick and xbox one."
To many commercials and not enough show. It's becoming one of the worst free apps to get if you want to watch movies and shows.im really tempted to take it off my phone and put Pluto on instead. I wish they would let us upgrade to a better package for Tubi.
The notifications are persistent even though disabled via system settings. This is REALLY annoying. I pay for my screen space so if an app wants to use it with wanton disregard then they can rent the pop up. Uninstalling. Can't give zero stars. Notifications are REALLY annoying. POS.
I liked watching Tubi before Fox ruined. The commercials are not too many but now TUBI pops up every 5 mins asking if you are enjoying the app or telling me to watch something in my queue. How about letting me watch what I'm watching now first!!!!!! This is unbelievably annoying and there is no way to turn it off. There needs to be a thumbs down button on every movie and TV show so I don't have to see the same Keanu Reeves movie suggested over and over again. Great concept.POOR EXECUTION
Installed it and uninstalled several times because nothing is loading or coming on the screen anymore. I'm in Seattle and the local channels just started looping after only a few seconds and then just froze. Now nothing is loading.
"BAD Simply Does Not Stream properly Every 10 seconds or so the previous 10 seconds will be repeated, not once but two or three times This results in further sections are cut so that the app can Catch Up to where it is supposed to be, resulting in lost content further along in whatever you may be watching Stick with PLUTO, it's just far more coherent than Tubi rubbish"
"Stopped working after recent update on my samsung galaxy android 12 phone. App won't load after bunny rabbit animation. Says ""that didn't work"". All my other streaming apps peacock, pluto, yt, crackle,etc work fine. Still works on all my other devices."
"WAS the best in its genre! However, the recent 'feature' that automatically plays live events until they are scrolled past is EXTREMELY annoying! Rating reduced from 5 to 1 star!"
"Great selection of movies but good luck getting it to buffer in one constant stream. I have 5G LTE and it stops every 10 seconds to load. The ads play fine, but any movie itself will not play. Sad. Guess this is what you get when it's free."
"This app sucks. It constantly disconnects in the middle of watching. ""Continue Watching"" takes you back to the beginning of the last episode already watched. There's no way to skip intros, and no jump ahead/back 30 seconds. Every time it crashes it's a back and forth with the progress bar trying to find where I left off. I've only found 2 shows worth watching, and once the second season of From is over I'm out."
"It works great on my phone but I tried casting it on my TV and it's all blacked out all I hear is them talking, I checked with the Epix app as well and their casting is having the same problem, can you guys create the TV app or something, or at least let me log in using the Epix app, this is getting a little stressing, if not for this I would have given it a better rating. (UPDATE: You guys still haven't fixed the app for the Samsung Smart TV.)"
"I'm watching my first show on MGM+. Show is good, but the app is completely frustrating! Can't watch an episode smoothly. Fast forward, rewind, nothing works properly. And don't think about leaving the app, and coming back to watch where you left off! That is a whole different set of issues! I will not be staying long if this continues."
"Programming is good, but the app is a nuisance. I've only watched Pennyworth and here are all the issues: The subtitles are full of errors, you can't skip through recaps or the show intro, and when you want to resume watching it sends you back to the start of the show. Lastly, there's no video preview when fast-forwarding and rewinding. I'm having these issues with my phone app and Fire Cube app. Epix needs to catch up with modern times with all their functions."
"Very problematic: I set it to do downloads overnite and none did. It said that it wasn't connected to the internet even though it was. It stops frequently while watching and after it has tried to restart, then most of the time says that something went wrong. I have to start again. Sometimes it will start at the right place and sometimes not. It often takes twice as long to watch a video as the listed time. Other video apps work well; this one does not."
"Unbelievably frustrating... I was giving it shot because the list of available titles is decent; however, I couldn't even start the trial, it kept declining my cards, all of them. So obviously there's an issue with your ridiculous app, so I'm not wasting any more time in it, and hope others don't either. Thanks for nothing Epix, I'm sticking to the pros (HBO, SHO)"
"This app is not user friendly, is super glitchy and constantly closes mid show. You have to remember what you were watching, scroll through all of the shows to find the show you were watching and then attempt to find the place in movie when the app crashed so you don't have to rewatch the entire thing - IF you can get the show to restart, it buffers constantly, even on the previously downloaded the content."
"I was excited to see the new War of the Worlds and was forced to install the app because EPIX lacks the ability to stream in the browser?? This app is broken, seriously I've never come across a worse app for media, It constantly says there is no connection when there is, video just stops and app has to be force stopped and reloaded and then reloaded two more times because it says there is no internet connection. OK, fine.. shortcomings are what they are, I'll deal with it. That was until I realized the selections they have, I literally can get the same content for free on a roku or stream online free. I've used home wifi, work wifi, cellular. same results. I won't recommend this to anyone, can't do that to anyone."
Impossible to cancel. I guess if you go through the playstore it's fine but I used some link when I ordered a pizza from Dominos and now I can't figure out how to cancel it. There's nothing in the settings. The help menu just tells you to go to the playstore where I didn't subscribe. When I tried emailing through the help menu the captcha kept getting errors so the email wouldn't go through. The whole thing is shady and overly complicated to cancel. They don't support Xbox so I couldn't stream.
"I received the free trial from Domino's which I thought was great, it works good on my phone but for some reason on my smart TV it won't play anything. The menu comes up perfectly but it won't let me watch anything it just goes to a blank screen. I've tried restarting, uninstalling and reinstalling anything you can think of but it just will not work..... Sucks cuz I was looking forward to seeing some of the movies it offered."
"Why do all the streaming apps have terrible playback controls for Android TV? This one is the worst. Forget trying to navigate the video, if you try to rewind âª there is no preview so you have to guess and you can only rewind once per video because it always goes back to the place you rewinded to the first time, and the time stamp shows you were at the same place you were before you rewinded. That's not all but I'm tired of explaining. Update: still sucks."
Worst app for watching movies ever! Slips so bad that it won't even let you watch the movie for more than 10 mins. Then it kicks you out and if it doesn't lock you out you have to go back to the beginning click on the app and start the movie again just for it to do it all over again. Tried and tried to cancel my app and ven though it says it has the support team on email says it isn't!! There is no # to call and no option to cancel inside the app only through play store!!
"Epix has great content but the APP itself is very basic: it doesn't display/remember which shows you've already seen or where you left off on a particular show, you can't do a quick 10sec replay or FF, the app keeps resetting to the first season of any show instead of allowing to browse the season you're interested in ... It's very frustrating."
"They claim to have 1000s of movies to watch. They're lying, I wouldn't even say that they have 100s of movies to watch. Even if you add in each episode of a TV show individually. More accurately, they have dozens of movies to watch. You could probably finish everything they have on this app before the trial expires."
"No fast forward or rewind button. Unreliable in continuing where I left off. Closed captions turn off and then I have to dig around in the app to turn them back on. It's like the weirdest, laggy, confusing app from the early 2000's. It's like the geocities of video entertainment."
"Subscribed to watch one movie that wasn't available anywhere else and we can't log in on anything but a phone, my TV and Xbox won't connect and theres no way to just log in on the TV apps, you have to connect it to a mobile app and I'm assuming they only approve subscribers that have the service through their cable provider. Just a waste of time and this was not clarified when we were signing up.."
"I got the 30day trial on my tv from Domino's because it seemed like a good deal but after numerous issues I'm not going to subscribe. First I started watching a horror movie then I paused its so I went back it said I cant watch it because I'm only allowed to watch Rated G! I never changed my settings so I had to fix it to finish. Then I started watching Pennyworth&when I tried to watch it again after pausing it, the video wouldn't play it just stopped working completely!I can't navigate now"
"Awesome shows, but there is no continuity. It does not display if an episode of a series has already been watched or even started. Also, it's not user-friendly. Hopefully, due to multiple reviews and feedback, the app will be updated in the near future."
"Just simply, terrible! I have never experienced buffering from any streaming service but this one. Thankfully it happens on the very first day of my 7 days free membership and on the very first TV series title I chose. All my streamers are getting over 350 Gb internet service out of the 1 Gb regular internet service we have in place. So this is obviously a server issue when the platform hasn't been ready to be launched. Would not recommend at all!"
I tried to cancel this subscription and I keep getting the run around about who to contact now I'm going to have to cancel the card because the customer service is no good they take the money easy but when it's time to cancel they stall and I've got endless emails claiming they can't cancel at my request!
Logged in and signed up through the website. App doesn't even return an error when I use the same login. Button registers the tap but does nothing. Useless waste of storage space.
"Horrible. The only way to watch it is to cast it on your TV. Every time I try and cast it, it doesn't show. Not like other apps were you just download it on your TV and watch it. You have to download it on your mobile device and cast it to your TV. Sucks"
"The audio is only stereo. They still can't figure out what Starz and Disney+ have. How to give us Dolby 5.1 surround. Netflix, Vudu, & HBO Max even have Atmos."
"Why have you removed the ability to scroll through ALL available movies? The latest update has made this app like others with multiple catagories and sub catagories (trending, because you watched, black, aisian pacific, women, lgbtq, if you liked, crowd pleasers). Race, sexual orientation, gender identity or programmed Ai guessing have no business in an app like this! The old version with simple movie and tv genres is more appropriate! More efficiency, less scrolling. Get rid of it, or I will."
Could this app suck anymore holy smokes it constantly just stops working when I attempt to open it and please make a real application I can download onto a Chromecast or something I don't want to have to screen cast thanks or don't idc however between you and bums at warner discovery you may have half a working app
Before buying this app make sure you know. It's only in the USA. And what's annoying very much is that Google Play is selling the App with no refund possible. A very much rip off policy?
"The app for Google TV sucks. It freezes, it's choppy. When continuing where you left off the screen freezes, but the audio plays on. The controls don't work, clicking Skip Intro and it skips a few seconds and continues to play on. Very sloppy app. The worst of the TV/Streaming Apps that I've used."
"HORRIBLE CONTROLS. Want to at least give 3-stars, but the reason I can't is NOT b/c of the app for my phone through Google Play, but rather the FireTV app. I have NEVER experienced a more horrible time dealing with the controls than that of the EPIX NOW app on the FireTV, OMG (here's looking at you, rewind and FF buttons/controls...). I'm leaving my review here though b/c, although the app on my phone isn't that bad, the app on the FireTV is SO bad I won't even finish my free trial!!"
"I have this subscription on my downstairs TV, but cannot open app upstairs without purchasing another subscription. Doesn't seem reasonable. Seems like there should be a better option."
"Even though I pay for the MGM+ channels through my Direct TV Stream subscription, unlike the other apps, they want me to pay for this one and it shouldn't be required. I refuse to do it."
"App is broken signed up with Google account, won't let me log in with the account used to sign up. Changed password and still will not let me log in. At this point I'm going to unsubscribe."
Couldn't get it to load on any of my devices and tried to call customer service and they couldn't help at all I tried to ask for a manager and was told no then was asked the same question I was asked five times before that had nothing to do with trying to log in y'all are a disappointment
The Google provided version of this EPIX/MGM+ app doesn't allow you to choose Samsung Smart TV as your visual provider like it says to do with the provided activation code so you can only watch it on your phone or maybe a computer. I have tried all ways that they have directed me to do and still can't use my SAMSUNG SMART TV to watch it on with my no refund year subscription...??? So m giving just one star for phone watching ability...!!!
Why are you showing spoilers for the shows I'm watching! Awesome I'm glad you ruined my viewing experience! You literally put unskipable ad of the show I'm already about to watch! This is so stupid!
I cannot get this on my samsung tv says I can cast it from the app on my phone just one problem I type in my password and email and app says it's incorrect. Really frustrating can get it on the little roku tv but not these devices. Now I can't even change password log in what a trash app never been more frustrated over an app
You can't watch downloaded content unless you have a connection to wifi or data. Seems kind of stupid to have a download option if you require connectivity to watch something offline that requires you to be connected.
"No foreign language subtitles as compared with Netflix and Disney+, such as Chinese"
Well if you don't have the right TV this won't have a picture and hell mine petty new insane and can't cancel threw the app you have to email them wow
I just paid a 1 year subscription and I am already having major issues. I downloaded the App on my TV. It tells me to cast from my phone. ð¤·ð¿ââï¸ I downloaded the App to my phone. No casting options. #Frustrated
Wow just got this subscription and the app stays frozen on logo smh I tried to open it on my smart tv too and same thing like wow guys really already making yourselves not worthy
Won't even connect to login. Garbage app.
"By far one of the worst streaming apps, you can not access your watch list without going through the settings menu and it crashes and reopens each time after having watched a show and come back to it later. Use it on Chromecast. Will be canceling after I finish the two shows I got EPIX for."
movies were downloading and now they're not please fix Since I can't download movies I'm canceling my subscription
Must download app on tv and phone and then cast. It constantly disconnects. By far the worst streaming app I've ever dealt with.
Sucks. Won't let me login using my cable provider (Epix). App gives NO way to login via cable provider. SUCKS!!! PLZ Fix before I just cancel and remove off my cable plan
"It keeps stalling and starting back every min when im trying to watch anything, its not my internet connection because none of my other apps are doing it, if they dont get it fix before next renewal im going to have to cancel it, its very annoying when you watching a good show and it pauses for 30 seconds or more every min or 2. I would love to restart my subscription if they fix the app to where it stops stalling every few secs."
"EPIX & MGM+ is garbage. Don't waste your time nor money on them. Explain to me how I can have a subscription, but I'm not authorized to view content? What's the purpose in having it, if I can't see the programming?"
"If you wanna hook up to Google home you have to give away information that this app shouldn't need , they are trying to collect personal information from Google account ."
"My family and I were looking forward to seeing Belgravia and the new War of the Worlds, but it only works on my phone! To watch it on my TV I have to use Epox Cast, and it only worked once! Since then, it keeps asking me to install Cast even though it's still installed, and then gives an error message! Really disappointed!!! Will be canceling my subscription."
"A complete scam. They offer a 30 day trial and will not let you cancel trial unless you trick it!! You must call or send an email. You must give a reason from the drop down box for the email and one is ""cancel subscription"". After doing the "" I am not a Robot"" deal before submitting the email, it will tell you there's a problem with authentication of captcha. I finally got smart and changed my reason for sending email and changed nothing else. Bam.. no problem submitting. Now the wait.. ."
I just want to cancel the subscription before the 30-day free trial is over. I got this information through a Domino's but the only way to cancel a subscription is by going to Google Play but I did not start this subscription through Google play so it is not under my subscriptions. You should be able to cancel the subscription on the app without having to go through the App Store. I can't see a thing
This was a waste of my time and I will NEVER download it again. Every single time I tried to login on my tv I would get the code and both the website and app said it was the wrong code. I reset everything 30 times and still wouldn't work. Honestly the worst streaming app I've dealt with... at least the other ones work like they're supposed to ð
Constantly disconnects from my chromecast saying no internet connection when there is or just stops for no reason. It takes me forever to get through just one show and then having to reconnect and finding the spot you left off because it doesn't save it for you!!! Completely frustrating!
The app keep freezing up on me and I have Chromecast and sometimes the window goes away and sometimes it comes back I keep installing and uninstalling it and every time I watch a movie is constantly freezing up on me . I figured I'd give it a second chance because this is my second time getting this app and this is my last time after this month I'm done. 5.99 gone smh
Ive been getting charged for epix now twice a month for over a year despite being told my payments declined. I have proof of charges in my bank statements. this is absolutely ridiculous. so much money spent & i can't even use the service I pay double for! Im just told to change my payment method. I've tried to cancel my subscription many times for a long time & I'm told a subscription cannot be found! I subscribed in November of 2020 and was charged once for 2 months & twice since Februar 2021.
"Absolutely terrible, not only does it not work but attempts to get anyone to possibly fix it are met with frustration, aggravation and generally useless clicking on a service that works about as much as box full of rocks. Wouldn't download it again if you paid me."
For a well known paid monthly subscription streaming service I would expect the Android app to have a option/setting to allow auto play that will non stop automatically play the next episode in the series or start new show of no more episodes. Same with movies. >BIGGEST DISLIKE: I want to be able to queue movies/shows so I can have a list of what I want to play next after each show or movie. And have another option that will randomly pick the next movie/show within my interests. 5-â­'s IF FIXED
"This app is garbage! No individual queues, the ""keep watching"" section doesn't work at all, and I keep getting a reminder that a new episode is available when there is none. If there were less than one star available, this app would get it hands down. Hire someone who knows how to build a working app."
"I got free with Domino's. It looked promising, but the selection was limited. Constant buffering and lagging issues with quality switching, on both my phone and smart TV. Other streaming services run smoothly on my devices l, but this one is meh."
"Literally the worst app. You can't even connect your account on a smart TV. It goes full retard and doesn't know what to do. Codes don't work, provider doesn't work -- the whole damn thing doesn't work.....I'm out after this. Didn't even watch a show or better yet run through the list/lineup"
"Content and quality =+5 stars App functionality =-4 stars. There's a lot to watch but the app wont function for poo. Sound keeps being ahead or behind. If i get a text everything stops. Still, considering keeping the subscripton to watch on my desktop (assuming that works, havent tried yet)"
Not worth the free trial. Very glitchy. Difficult to navigate. Search feature is pathetic. You only get one chance to see the list of items matching your search term. You can only pick one item from the list to view. You can't go back to the list. You have to go back to the search feature and re-enter your search terms every time.
"The app is unable to connect to the internet and as such is completely useless. Keeps throwing an error prompting to check my internet settings. My internet is fine however and this is the only installed app that is unable to connect to the internet. Paired with a poor selection of movies and shows, unsubscribed."
"All it does is buffer. I have a Roku TV and I paid for the subscription and it's not working. It doesn't give you the option to select Roku, as stated for activating. I've tried logging in several times and it's not working. I'm canceling my subscription and I just got it."
"Terrible useability of app! Very confusing whether you need epix, epix cast or epix now cast, it takes at least 30 mins for the app to even show the cast button to show up on the TV! All the TV allows you to do is watch trailers. There is no way to just login & watch from my TV, every single time I have to open my phone, start the show I want & then cast, & if I'm not home everyone else can forget watching it on the TV bc it only casts from my phone! Dumbest & MOST DIFFICULT network app EVER!!"
"App stops streaming to the TV when phone screen shuts off. Got 10 minutes into a movie for the grandkids before app stopped streaming. Twice because I couldn't even resume the streaming, but, had to restart the whole streaming process over."
"1 star because it has very few movie choices and it buffered SO much! Had to restart one movie several different times. I downloaded the app due to a free 30 day trial provided by Domino's but unistalling after 1 day. Also, most of the movies I had never heard of before."
"I can't believe that it's still not possible to stream epix, in a browser, on a laptop...that feature has been "" comming soon,"" for a really, really,really (and did i mention ""really""), long time? that in itself, places a ""deal breaker"" on it, for me... obviously, not in a positive sense of the phrase"
"Subscribed through Google account, but the only way to log in is to download the app to my phone. From there, I can't connect it to my TV or Chromecast because it says the code is incorrect. Super frustrating that you can't just log into epix on a browser and sort this out."
"Epix Now mirrors Hulu basically 95%, which I already subscribe to. I got 30-Day trial from Dominos, and was going to cancel, but none of the cancellation options apply to me. They don't apply to how I signed up. So now I am wondering if I am going to get charged after 30 days because I can't figure out how to cancel. Epix Now would have to get payment info from some other source since I never provided it. I'll be super mad if that happens."
Just unbelievable this app and how poor it is as well as Domino's 30-day free trial that I had to pay to use then while trying to work with them to get it fixed they deleted my account and all my information including my free trial which means I have to pay for all of it and will never get my issues fixed even though I never requested it they put in the system per my request which is false and a lie
This app continues to have a plethora of bugs. I pay a monthly subscription fee and am unable to cast content to my smartTV. If this problem isn't corrected im going to cancel my subscription. The major premium cable providers don't have this problem.
"Downloaded it on my Sony Bravia (2019) TV, signed up for 7 day free trial......couldn't get past the part where they ask for who your provider is. Mine wasn't listed in their drop down menu......so I cancelled and uninstalled it.....not much in the way of support."
"Figured i would try the service out since i got a free month from dominos pizza. And I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING AFTERWARDS. It is a complete mess. The app works(occasionally) on my phone and i cannot connect to my xbox 1, tablet, or laptop. I get stuck in a loop trying to activate devices. It is constantly asking for logins it has no reason to ask for. If EPIX intends for this to be a rival to ANY streaming service LOL. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Pretty annoyed and irritated that i wasted mine."
When you scroll through movies it shouldn't force jump you to one. It should be a seamless scroll. It I want to scroll and stay between two movies well let me. It's annoying to be bounced either back or forth depending on how close you are to it. ANNOYING.
"Nothing is loading, every title I select just shows a yellow loading circle under the details tab that lasts indefinitely. I can however play things from my history tab.. Maybe if movies had a play button from the get go instead of making me muddle through menus that don't function, I could actually use this app."
"*Update after resonse. THANK YOU for responding here. The trial was clear as mud thru Dominos. Now I won't worry. Hope others read this as well. *Old review I got this as a free trial thru Dominos pizza and CANNOT unsubscribe. There is nowhere to get rid of this useless app. Put on Roku app but didn't sign up thru Roku. Literally no where to stop this. Can't even find a ""contact me"" area. *On Roku app there is no My List. Navigation is a joke. It's horrible"
"What a joke got free trial no where to cancel subscription any form of communication isnt working either says enter wrong captcha or invalid selection, has an email to contact corporate that sends back an email saying delivery cant be sent. There's no way of communication with this company or cancelling before free trial ends..I'll be disputing charges with my bank since this company lacks communication.Wouldn't try free trial unless you want stuck with app seems like scam to me."
Absolutely horrible app. Didn't save a spot in the movie I was watching. Now it won't cast to smart tv even though it did yesterday. Glad there was a free trial. Showed me I definitely don't want to waste my $ on a subscription. Garbage app and service.
Ordered pizza and got this epix now for free for 30 days. I only watched it for about an hour and a half and then deleted the app . The movie kept freezing up and picture was stopped but the audio was still working fine. Not worth the hassle of just listening to a movie with no picture even if it's Free . Gave it 1 star because I can't give it a -5 star rating .
"Everytime I try to load EpixNow on my Roku TV it immediately shuts off it will load for literally 3 seconds and then it will shut off so I cannot watch anything at all. What is the point of having it if I can't watch it? Also, I have been trying every possible method in the world to unsubscribe and I find it impossible. I am convinced this is what Epix does. They take your money and then refuse to allow you to unsubscribe even though you cannot use their service in any way."
"Supposed to be free with Quantum Fiber, couldn't login to the app without a provider. No XBOX app, really? Logged in with my browser to checkout the movie selection and it's just awful. Couldn't uninstall fast enough."
"horrible, sadly it doesn't even deserve 1â­...I guess I subscribed for the 7 day trial but when tried to download a movie it kept saying please subscribe, deleted the app because I'm assuming I don't have the 7 day free trial, just to find out I do, and now can't download the app again.. unbelievable, never been through something like this before, canceled the prescription permanently ð£"
"AP download free yes but Feebased $15/month to use it according to cable provider. Movies are older releases and the library didn't change ofter enough to justify the fees, There are Free APs that offer a wider variety of movies and those free choices have a more up to date selection. casting buffers which is distracting also it's content needs to be more in step with the free services if your going to ask for service fees. Stay safe and don't forget to where a mask when downloading this ap"
"Worst TV streaming app ever! Paying for this app to watch is just not worth at all! Please fix, there are tons of issues, video doesn't play many times, subtitles flag doesn't work half the time, navigation is horrible!!"
"Don't even bother subscribing to Epix. Their whole movie and show selection is trash. There is barely any content. Everything they have, you can get on Hulu or Netflix. Totally not worth it. Just $3 for a 3 month trial today, and I'm canceling it and deleting the app. You get what you pay for. Total waste of $3. I should have used it and went and got a Quarter Pounder w cheese; which is way more valuable than this junk here.. Just a horrible piece of dog $hit of an app. Save your time & move on"
Downloaded this app on my Google tv. It doesn't work properly you can get into the app. When you try to look at what you wanna watch it glitches out and goes black and all you can see is the side menu.
Disconnected from chromecast 2 times in the first 10 minutes of a movie. Says there is no internet but there is. Good thing I only had to pay 99 cents to see the one movie I wanted. It will probably take the whole month to do so at this rate
"got this app after redeeming a code through dominoes and was under the impression we would't be charged after the 30 days but after reading the reviews i am seeing they are charging people after the free trial and i would like to cancel this all together, i didn't need another app i just figured if it was free i would try it out in case i wanted to cancel netflix in the future"
"Live tv does not cast for some reason. ð¤ Could that be fixed expeditiously? And why is Epix Now NOT on Xbox One? I'm trying my hardest to give you guys a 5 star rating, but I keep finding reasons to take stars. ð¤·ð¾ââï¸ Yes. Live tv is the only issue on my mobile device. That's why tried to download it on my Xbox, but discovered it's just regular Epix and not Epix Now."
Can't manage the subscription from the app and it's not showing up in my play store subscriptions and now I can't cancel my member so hopefully this gets fixed and you cancel it for me. Not to mention the customer service is terrible.
"I just want to use my phone to watch Pennyworth and whatever other shows and movies they have but it wont let me make an account because i don't have cable. I expected this to be like Netflix or Hulu where you give them money and watch what the have to offer, but apparently not. I tried to pay for their service but theres no option without having cable."
You can only watch live TV on demand then it freezes and I have to restart my fire stick.
Got it on Google Play. Tried to use it on Firestick. Couldn't use it. If you buy Now though the play store you should be able to use it on Roku or Firestick. You still have to use a cable company etc. If I ordered though xfinity I could use it on other devices. Hope you fix that soon.
"Hands down, the worst streaming service ever. If you manage to even stay logged in, you'll find the worst selection of movies possible. Also, there is no way to cancel that I've found yet."
"I have been installing and uninstalling this app for 2 days (as instructed by i.t.) because it will not connect to my chromecast device. Very dissapointedð­ I cancelled my subscription weeks before my 30 day trial was over but they charged my card for an entire month, very bad business practices.ð¨"
No compatibility with EPIX app. It's 2021 and cable TV subscriptions are declining quickly. Do not release apps that have no compatibility with your primary app and make it impossible for customers to stream on additional devices. If you're thinking of subscribing to watch Saint Maud then don't. EPIX NOW app and EPIX app are two different apps that do not connect to each other despite being made by the same company. Rating should be 0 out of 5 stars.
I put my code in for the Dominos 30 days. However I unsubscribed from my membership 2 days after installing cause there isnt anything new I hadn't seen before. But now it being a week later now Epix has charged me a month membership when I had a 30 day code and I unsubscribed anyhow!! Do not install!!! Get Hulu or Netflix either is so much beyter with newer movies. Plus then you don't get caught up in this mess!!
"Downloaded the Epix Now app since I got a promo code from ordering pizza from Domino's. Honestly, there isn't much content on there that's worth checking out. Hoping I won't get charged once my free trial is over, I can't find the option to opt out anywhere."
"I signed up for this app because of Domino's but when I went to use it I found that it does not cast to TV from the phone app and they apparently do not have a version setup for LG tvs so I can't watch directly on my television, and there is no app for windows and you cannot watch directly from their website. Which all in all means the only way I can watch anything from them is on my phone even though I have a beautiful 65"" TV sitting there begging to be used."
"Random play is not very random, at times queuing tracks from the same artist and album in a row. I thought it would be different when paying from the chrome browser on my desktop but the experience is still the same. Also don't like that my ""liked"" playlist is limited to 5000 songs. Plus some of the artwork for older music is totally off."
"Switching from play music is required, meaning you can no longer identify a song that's playing with your phone, because that's a feature no one used. Want to listen to an album then have the music stop afterwards? Impossible, music you didn't request is automatically added to the queue and this cannot be turned off. If you're using a different streaming service do not switch, this is hot garbage. Updated 5/2023 do not use, still can't search a song currently playing without switching apps."
If an album has more than 200 tracks all the tracks after 200 don't show up. Every time you like or dislike a track you lose access to your queue for around 5 seconds. There isn't a way to search for playlist that don't contain YouTube videos if I want to listen to music I want to listen to the high quality music files not some unofficial random low quality YouTube video. Lots of little things that get in the way of what would otherwise be fine.
"I hate the new UI/layout. I have nothing but contempt for useless floating keys that just get in the way of vital viewing space. They are utter trash pieces. It's infuriating to accidentally tap the stupid thing 90,000 times! Make your Playlist suggestions optional to view. I want my stuff, not yours! Keep it simple and clean and easy to use. Scrap this junk."
"The app crashes ever few songs, stutters with downloaded song, and randomly stops playing. Only reason I'm keeping premium is because of YouTube videos. Update: it refuses to work properly and now every song stops and starts until it crashes even with a good connection. Several other people that also use it tell me the same. Edit: now I can't go 30 minutes even online without it crashing. It's only the music app that I ever have issues with"
"Most recent update is trash...cannot play multiple songs in a row without it stopping and having to unlock the screen; only then will it play. Stops halfway through songs and is overall a miserable experience. Also, it loads my regular YouTube video account with a bunch of music ""videos"" in my recommended viewing list. What is the point of having a separate app? 3 Month Update: still same issues...constant crashing and songs stopping until you unlock the screen... miserable experience."
Wow! I hate this updates layout. Now you're just forcing me to look at the top hits when it's not even remotely goes to the same music that I listen to and there's no way to remove the suggestions. I have to scroll past three different recommendation posts from top 40 hits before I can get to the music. I actually want to listen. Thank you for telling me what I should listen to.
Going on 7+ years and it seems they've finally fixed the shuffling issue. My biggest issue now is that the app doesn't play your downloaded music by default. I have thousands of songs downloaded for offline play and the app still streams them over network/wifi. If I do not have network service or wifi it is almost impossible to get the app to even open. Let alone once it does open it takes another 20 minutes just to navigate to the downloads on your device. How is this acceptable?
"Normally, I'd rate 5 stars because the app is easy to use & has all my favorite music. For the past week or so, however, the app has been constantly crashing & skipping songs. My phone is up to date, the app is up to date. I get a notification saying ""YouTube Music keeps crashing"" and to put it into sleep mode. I've tried clearing the cache, restarting my phone, and uninstalling/reinstalling the app & nothing has worked. This is a very annoying and frustrating issue & I have a paid subscription."
Update 4/19/23. Want to cast on repeat? It'll play once or twice then stop. Still trash. I refuse to believe they're so dumb they can't get this right. Update: want to listen to the last song of an album and loop the album? If you're casting you can't. Doesn't work in simple situations like bluetooth headphones when I'm working out and can't pull out my phone. Garbage. Supremely frustrating. If you're considering it go with Spotify or anything else instead.
"This app has steadily gotten worse! I pay monthly to be able to listen to music uninterrupted, and it never works correctly! They don't seem to care either! I'm doing research now on what music streaming platform I can move to because I'm sick of paying for something that never works! Yesterday it just crashed every time I opened it. When it does work it only plays a song or two before it says there is am error it's just not worth your money! Don't pay for this app!!"
"This app used to work well but ever since they did a UI update months ago, it has become garbage. Navigating through my downloads is a hassle, if they even work at all. I'm often left in silence as the app struggles to perform basic functions. I have to constantly adjust my settings because they keep being reset for some unknown reason. I just want to download albums to listen to while I travel and I can't do that anymore so I will definitely be cancelling my premium subscription soon."
"I much prefer the classic YouTube playlists. This app doesn't adjust playlists when I ""thumbs down,"" & most of the time, the songs annoy me. I've tried to adjust playlists several ways (like by artist), but they never change. The playlists are too broad- like on radio- without an option to narrow the mood, so it's not for ppl who know what they want to hear. I guess it's for ppl that listen to larger varieties of artists. It also doesn't play directly on my watch, but that maybe a galaxy issue."
"This is my go to music app, recently the play queue has been a bit buggy though. Update, now the ""play next"" button is just straight up broken. I have multiple screen recordings of this if the developers would like to see what I'm talking about. Update: this is so frustrating, I've sent videos of the issue in the feedback and it just doesn't get fixed. PLEASE I just want to use the ""play next"" button then this app would be so good"
"I have had the worst time with this app lately. I feel lucky if I get through one song entirely before it just stops playing. I can't cast music, Bluetooth music or even just listen through my phone speaker. It just stops after one song, refuses to play another, and blames my network for the interruption. I've restarted my network, restarted my phone, everything is up to date and I STILL get problems. Switching to Spotify now but I'll check in every now and again."
"One Star cus it is Ad Free and easy to use but that's it. I used to listen to Spotify for offline music which was great until Offline would only download certain songs in my playlist for whatever reason. So I switched to YT Music. Download Music works better BUT it'll randomly stop playing songs frequently. On a two hour train ride I was hitting the Play Button at least twice a song from my Download List. I tried turning it Off/On, cleared cache and still no change. iTunes might replace it."
"Horrible. If you're looking to play your own, locally stored music files, look elsewhere. There should be *instant* response when trying to view them, not a long load time as the app unnecessarily pings a server, and the local files should not be tucked away from the user. Even it's YT integration is terrible. Somehow a worse app than the Google Music app it replaced. Look for a better fit to your needs."
I wanted to listen to a particular song and for some reason I couldn't play it. I searched and played the song by pressing the button but it would redirect me to a new song each time I tried to play it. I will no longer be using this service until this issue is fixed and I cannot recommend it to anyone wanting to listen to music. It's disappointing because I don't have Spotify premium and I got it first try but I've been paying for YouTube premium for years and censorship is all I get.
"app can't clear the queue. always glitching out. Google should fire whoever is developing this. An app that claims to be about music but doesn't even have basic features every other music app has EDIT: one year later and this app is still bad. Deleted a bunch of my music for some reason EDIT: many years later and this whole service is still trash EDIT: years later and still bad. I listen to rap, and always plays the CLEAN version, not explicit. Need a setting to avoid clean version"
"This app is terrible with Android Auto. If I skip too many songs going back through a playlist, the app freaks out and completely stops working. It's ALWAYS done this. No matter how many times you people update this app, nothing ever gets any better. I pay for premium and this is the service I receive? What a waste of money. You guys have NO idea what you're doing. Zero stars until this is fixed."
This app crashes more than it works. Every song or every other song I have to restart the app because it stops playing no matter if it's on wifi or cellular connection. I have very strong connections on both and have no trouble with Apple music playing. YouTube has gotten so much worse over the last year. It made me cancel my premium subscription because it was so bad. Fix this so we can listen to music and not have to constantly be messing with the app!
"Been using this app for over 2 years. I have enjoyed listening to my favorite music, now the app won't let me enjoy it as the music cuts off after a few minutes. Sometimes multiple songs will play through their entirety, most times cut out during the 1st song played. Cancelled my membership and deleting the app until it's fixed. I see now I'm not the only 1 dealing with this problem."
"I hate this app so much, more so because we are forced to use it with Android Auto. 1. I have music on my phone, I just want to listen to the music I own, this app will not play three consecutive times in the car without forcing me to open the app to sign in, I don't want to sign in, I just want to play MY music. 2. After signing in from frustration, it's even worse, it takes forever to access music on my phone, and constantly wants me to get subscriptions I don't want. JUST PLAY MUSIC!!"
"This app has become trash. I pay a monthly subscription so that I can play music through this app with zero interruptions, and every time recently, after a song concludes, it doesn't go to the next song. Sometimes a song abruptly stops, and I have to turn on my screen, unlock my phone, open the app and press 'play', even though I never stopped the song myself. This is a Google based product, but it behaves worse than a windows Vista computer. FIX THIS!!"
"App crashes when running in background. After maybe 30 seconds to a couple of minutes, the app will crash if I try to do anything but leave it in the foreground. Doesn't matter what I am doing with the phone, sound related or not, once the app is in the background, it will crash. Been like this for some time. Everything is up to date, cleared caches and data, reinstalled app."
I'm frustrated with YouTube Music. I'm daily encountered by problems. The music skips repeatedly. It constantly needs updated. I've trouble when loading music. It's not responding to basic commands.ð¡ I'm at my breaking point! I've looked but can't find a 1-800 number. I need to talk with YouTube Music. I don't get to listen or enjoy the music I pay them for. Thanks ð¡
"I'm paying for premium so I can listen to music while I do work. Ever since the new update ruined everything, the music stops in the middle of songs randomly. If the screen is off, it stops. If I switch to another app, it stops. Even if I actively have the app on screen and open, the music stops and the song disappears. Not only is the new interface ugly, harder to navigate, and was overall unnecessary, but now the app doesn't even succeed at its only function. Please fix this."
"For over 2 years I've been paying for this app that doesn't seem to play music for longer than 2 minutes at a time before shutting off if the screen turns off or if I'm doing a simple task at work with it in the background, this happens with downloads and all other playlists. New phones changed nothing, I had hoped for this issue to be solved but after 2 years I am losing hope, I don't enjoy paying A LOT for a monthly service that doesn't work very well and is a detriment to my daily work flow."
"Well, I have to hop on the band wagon with a lot of other viewers. I'm relieved to see that I'm not the only one all of sudden experiencing problems with this app. I've been using it for several months and just in the last few weeks I've had problems with my music constantly stopping and I'm having to restart it. Very upsetting and annoying when I'm driving and Very embarrassing and disappointing when trying to entertain guests. Google needs to fix it or I'm unsubscribing from YouTube Music!!!"
"There's no way to fully close the app, it constantly runs in the background. 2 issues with this: 1. drains your battery RAPIDLY. 2. If you connect to a new Bluetooth device (like a car, for instance), OR if you simply open Google Maps, it will automatically start playing your last played song. But the app isn't actually open on your phone so you can't turn it off. Cause that's the distraction I need while driving. Deleting for the second time."
"Used to love this app. Now it has to buffer or will stop songs multiple times and I have to go back in the app to push play. I've tried everything under the sun from clearing the cache, deleting the app and reinstalling, getting off wifi and back on, using cellular data, moving to a better location, turning the phone on and off, nothing helps and it's so aggravating considering it is a paid subscription. Will definitely be looking for something else."
"This is the worst app I have on my phone. It used to be really good. Now it can't make it through a few songs without issues. Yesterday it played the same 2 songs on repeat despite having a playlist of 50+ songs. I wish there was a way to turn off everything except for the songs I've uploaded to cloud/downloaded to device, but searching seems to break that every time."
"So much potential and yet it's just terrible. Very cluttered home interface. Library and your uploaded songs are in different locations. Can't easily organize your library (by genre, etc.). Search results are a mix of helpful and unrelated items. Lost the plot on building a music app to focus on one that mainly just ties into YouTube. Can't believe they killed Play Music for this."
"Ever since the new update I hate it! I used to love it but now the music stops randomly, I have to continously re open the app to select a song to keep listening! I don't like the new interface and it's harder to navigate. Don't fix what wasn't broken! Seriously considering canceling premium and pay for something else that works. Please fix asap."
"Horrible!! I have premium, and the songs will continually stop. I restart it, and it will stop, mid song, for no reason. Many times. It's so annoying!! A friend of mine said it does this all the time without premium, but I have premium. You would think they would fix this glitches with the app. Very disappointed. I miss Google music!!!"
"No joke, it took about eight min to listen to a 3:36 song. This sucks. Really, you can get Spotify for the same price and the music isn't constantly stopping in the middle of a song. Got a new phone, thinking it might be an issue with that...nope, still stops every song in the middle (sometimes more than once) of it and I have to stop what I'm doing to open the app back up and hit play again...even with the downloaded music. Cannot express how much I have to advise not using or paying for this."
"Music don't play, if you don't keep the app on the screen n put it in the the background it will stop playing. It kinda pointless to pay for something to listen to music and Still be able to use your phone, if you wanna listen to music and still use your phone, well as of right now this isn't the app it started off perfect then someone decided to changed something that wasn't broke. There a old saying, if it isn't broke don't fix it, n this is the perfect example worked great then update"
"I find it incredibly aggravating that this application chooses to stream music that I already have downloaded instead of prioritizing playing that music from local storage. It's inefficient, wasteful, and overall makes for a poor experience. I don't understand how this application is still terrible and lacks features that weren't some of the earliest versions of many now defunct music streaming services. Pathetic."
"If I had a dollar everything this app randomly closed or crashed while listening to music, I'd be able to purchase my own streaming service. Layout is way worse than Play Music was, too, just to rub salt further into the wound. Also sometimes it doesn't register tracks are playing, so when you queue up a song to play after it just skips to that track instead. Really stellar app!"
"You still can't close the app and listen to it in the background. The functionality of it is still inferior to Google Play. It's so basic and oh my goodness, it possibly has the worst playlist selections for any song when you start the radio for it... Literally plays the same playlist every single time, like dude at least shuffle it up a bit. Worst recommendations ever. I am so tired of the same supermix selections in the exact same order every single time. Play one new song and they repeat it."
"Way too many problems: From continuously recommending me only songs that I already have in my playlists to that dumb little pop-up that I can't close. And it's the pop-up that doesn't give you the option to dismiss it since the only options are to start a free trial or to skip to paying. Once it appears, it never goes away and blocks the buttons on the bottom. It also only plays a few songs despite me having some 75+ song playlists. Many more issues, but I don't have enough characters left :/ ð¢"
"I loved Google play using and I still like the way YouTube music works. The only problem is that my music now stops on its own ALL THE TIME. It doesn't pause, the app literally closes. Happens when connected to Bluetooth, headphones, or just playing in the phone. I can't enjoy more than a few minutes, sometimes even seconds of my music without it stopping. Makes paying for this app pointless."
"Dame experience as other recent reviewers. I've had a premium membership with this service since before Google Play transitioned and never had any issues. Over the last few weeks the app crashes after 5 songs. I too, thought it was my phone but it crashes on any device. I'll be canceling my membership before the end of the month if it's not fixed."
"App is a downgrade from Play Music. While having access to your own library still you cannot play music in the background any longer, missing features that the previous app had. Edit: Moving out down to 1 star. Design changes to the UI are making it more difficult to locate previously purchased songs and uploaded music. I can only assume this to be a predatory change to encourage people to purchased a subscription."
"Zero stars!!! For at least 6 months, the music stops mid song and goes into buffering, circling and circling!! I've been PAYING for this streaming service for quite a while now and believe that I, and anyone else who's experiencing this issue, is due a refund for 6 months of not being able to use this app!! While it being data, wifi, in the car, using ear pods, a wireless speaker or just playing in the background, this app does not function properly!!! I don't see any effort to fix!!"
"Overall a great app that I use pretty much every day and have no major issues with. Minor issues I've come into contact with are, some downloaded songs randomly being unplayable due to being restricted (restriction mode is off) and sometimes it takes forever to switch to downloads/offline. Lowered rating to one star after trying to get assistance to no avail."
Makes listening to my music so much harder. The branding is confusing. It doesn't cache my library so it slowly loads titles as I'm scrolling. The search defaults away from my library. The assistant can't find my music. A song I created myself has a playlist added to it instead of just stopping when the song was over. Same for music from my personal library. I got Premium to remove ads from YouTube. The YouTube Music experience is not better in any way after subscribing. I do not recommend this.
"The app works well, but recently it has begun to play non explicit versions of explicit songs in the auto generated que. It does not mark on clean versions ad such (except the lack of the explicit tag). I have explicit filter turned off. There is not way to turn off this ""feature."" I use this app to help me find new music that I like. The fact that it is giving me altered versions of songs without telling me is a violation of my trust in the algorithm."
"I gave this a 1 star rating because of the latest update. I pay for the premium subscription and why am I paying for it? So I can listen to my music without any interruptions. But I'm getting them. Music stops randomly, screen has to be on. I can't even listen to my music in my VW cause the music keeps stopping. Fix the update so we all can enjoy our music. Don't ""fix"" things that aren't broke!"
"Your last update has glitched the smooth running of the app and it needs to be fixed!! When I listen from my playlists, it repeatedly pauses/stops playing midsong once the screen times out. This is exceptionally annoying, especially when attempting to fall asleep to music but keep having to repress Play or refresh. I pay for a Premium subscription and the app is not, nor has it been, performing its primary function. A refund is in order."
"Updated 3/25/2023: app is still pretty awful with Android Auto. If I want to search for an album to play from my uploads, the library when connected to Android auto is missing almost my entire collection. For example, let's say I want to listen to the band Wake. Outside of accessing their new album from the ""recently played"" menu, none of their albums or EPs show up under W in the alphabetical display of the uploaded library. But when you search in the app outside the car, it's all there."
"Whatever update they did has caused it to pause music randomly. Even when my phone is on, it will randomly cut the music and pressing ""play"" on my headphones to continue the music won't work sometimes. I think the only time it won't pause music is if you stay on the app page.. not very convenient for multitasking and not good for battery opposed to having the screen off. Please fix this it was an awesome Mao before."
"Continuously getting worse. Now, all of my EDM songs have a ""10 sec. back, 30 sec. forward"" instead of a skip. Not all of my songs play when I put a Playlist on shuffle and some need to be added multiple times to have it play at all which is inconvenient when I'm driving and can't just get to the song even when I know it's in the Playlist. Still glitches and sometimes will take up to an hour to load. As soon as I get my iPod back I'm done with this trash."
"A month ago it started pausing for a moment at irregular intervals before resuming. Deeply annoying and ruins the music. Online I found other people complaining about the same thing but no fixes. Also, it can't replay songs. It gets stuck in loading hell. To listen again you actually have to close out of the song and then re-select it."
"This app is even worse than I originally thought. I can't play music in the background while using other apps and it plays adds while listening to my own music. I switched over from Google Music since they are apparently shutting that down soon and I hate it. I use these apps to store and play music that I uploaded and this app is much more clunky for doing that. It keeps trying to sell the premium version were you can stream music, but I am not interested. - Now I can't even browse my own songs"
I have this app because Google recommended I get this to listen to my personal music saved on my phone after they did away with Google Music. What a terrible app to be honest. It plays two of my songs then just sits and loads or days. I can pull up the list of songs and click a song and then it takes 30+ seconds to even the load the song... This song is saved on my phone... Why is it so slow?
I have a long list of issues with this app Mainly that they shut down google play music (a much better service with more features) and forced users over to this app. They rarely update this app and when they finally did they made it alot harder to find the music I listen to regularly. But the biggest issue is that now out of nowhere so many of the albums I had added are missing or have large portions of the album missing. Very frustrating
"Bring back Google Music please. Never had any issues with Google Music. Since the switch to YouTube Music, this app is terrible. How hard is it to fix a glitch that causes the songs to stop 30 seconds into it?? And this happens no matter what Bluetooth device I'm connected to. When I shuffle a playlist, why the hell would I only want to shuffle 20 songs and not the whole playlist?? Stupid. Worst music app. Definitely not worth the money. Switching over to something else."
"All this time later after replacing Google Play Music and it's still not as good. I just want to listen to the music I purchased, but uploads take extra time to get to, you have to wade through multiple ads asking you to subscribe, and the app only remembers PART of the playlist you were listening to when you reload it. Garbage"
"I have been paying for ""Google Play Music"" (which transitioned into YouTube music) for about 12 years. I was extremely skeptical when they made the transition, but all seemed to go well. Within the last 2 months, I have noticed the app crashes and stops playing music. At first, I thought it was my phone or car, but it's been happening in all vehicles and across all devices. This is unacceptable, and I'd like to see it fixed asap. Until then, don't waste your time or money."
The app keeps stopping in the middle of a song or di won't advance to the next song. I've updated it and it still isn't working correctly. I wish they never got rid of Goggle Play. To make matters worse I'm paying for Premium. Apple Music is looking better and better. It comes with my plan and I won't have to continue to PAY for an app that doesn't work. Whatever y'all did with the last update you screwed up the app. Not a happy customer!!!
"Great app... experiences will vary. The UI is easy to use and seemless with music you already have liked from YouTube. But I wish you luck with the app because even on a Google Pixel 6, a Google made phone, you may be able to play a total of three songs before you have to force stop the application in order to have the app work again. So one star because the app is borderline unusable."
"Disappointed. I've had my subscription for less than a year. I was loving it. Now I'm going to cancel my subscription and go back to pandora. I love having ad free music, but why does it take almost 5 mins for a song to buffer? To make the buffering go faster, I have to open the app. The whole point of paying was to not have to worry about ads and be able to let my phone lock while I work out or do chores and enjoy jamming out. The buffering issue is between every song. Worst part, it's on wifi"
"Ever since a recent update, it crashes ALOT. If it doesn't crash it will go back to the YouTube music main page. It also pauses randomly now. Have to close and reopen to work. I was already on the fence about renewing premium, this pushes me full into a hard no. But, before all this, it worked pretty well. If it can be reverted then great."
"Was my favorite music app until the recent update. Now the first 30 seconds of any song, downloaded or not, is choppy and cuts out randomly. 75% the time the app crashes before a full minute plays and then won't restart without immediately crashing again. Also despite paying for premium it seems I can't run it in the background anymore. As soon as I transfer to another window or app it just shuts down. Very disappointing."
"With Google play being gone, this was one of the few choices I had for music. It was fine for a while, but for some reason lately YouTube music seems to randomly stop playing and closes out. I thought it was my cell signal. Nope, even with downloaded music it still fails play continuously and closes out at random times. Please fix this, it is beyond annoying dealing with this."
"The app frequently seizes up. I'll be cruising along the, suddenly ni music have to reboot at least 6 times on a 75 mile road trip. I signed up mainly because I could download all this great music. Thing is If I go for using the app off line. The app just crashes. Please fix it! I loved this app. I deserve a refund for the dozens of disruptions it causes me each week. Fix it!"
"Why are you censoring what I can or can't listen to YouTube Music? When the sound stops and I have to go to the app on my desktop or open the app on my phone (usually while in the car) only to find out you're warning me (again) that the next song has serious content of some sort. Once, sure. But give me the option to turn it off after that! I pay for premium membership, I deserve premium rewards! I can't believe it..."
"The new UI update is pretty ugly, and im not sure what update caused it, but the app crashes. It stops mid song when you tab out/switch out to another app or even when you use an app like Waze/Google Maps. The crashes even affect the downloaded songs, which doesn't make sense to me. I'm paying for YouTube Music Premium, and it's been pretty bad so far. My main issue is the constant app crashing, I'll change my review when these crashes stop happening."
"Taking away the option to create a radio station based on decade is the worst update yet in a series of terrible updates. The only reason I still use this bad app is because it's included with YouTube premium, but this is making me research other music apps. And it's still only available in dark mode, which is a serious accessibility issue. As soon as I get a chance to download my purchased music, I'm uninstalling."
Any time I start listening to music it will either pause or completely shut off. I've tried clearing my cache for the app in hopes it would help and it hasn't. I've tried deleting and reinstalling the app with no luck either. It's frustrating to constantly have to go into the app to restart a song or unpause. I'd give it zero stars if I could.
I have had this app for a very long time and it has been perfect. Yes I subscribe so I do not have to listen to the commercials and download. But lately the app has been terrible. Every few songs it crashes or says there is an error. Everything is updated but it continues to pause out. Please fix this you tube so I don't have to switch to Spotify. I'm sure they won't mind my subscription.
I'm paying for a premium membership that I can't even listen to for 2 seconds before it randomly crashes. I thought it was my phone also but I upgraded to a completely different phone and it still does it. If this issue doesn't get resolved soon I'm canceling my membership. As much as we're being charged for a membership you can't even take an advantage of the perk of a paid membership.
"I don't understand how this app is so bad. Just randomly stops playing or won't even bother playing the next song if the app is running in the background, which seems like kind of a big deal for a music player. I feel like YouTube has the money and resources to fix this thing. I stopped using this app for a long while and sort of forgot why, but it all came rushing back to me when I redownloaded it this morning. Disappointing."
"I'm trying out YTM for the first time in Android and it's been a frustrating experience. The music I'm playing will frequently just stop in the middle of a song for whatever reason, and I either need to go to the app to get it to play again or it'll restart in the middle of a previous song. I don't mind the interface, but honestly this is the biggest issue I have with this app. I'd like to be able to listen to the music seamlessly without it stopping."
I've always loved this app because of its ability to play in the background. I'm not sure what happened or I'd there was a bad update.. but I can't even switch over to a simple text message without it completely shutting down the app. It's pretty infuriating and will be looking into other streaming apps.
"It used to be great. Now the music (all downloaded) randomly stops playing mid song... Every 5-10 minutes. I use music to focus while working, and this becomes an interruption. If it keeps up I will find another player. Update: still happening, getting worse. Might be time to save all my music as mp3 and find a good player app."
Started with Google Play Music and had to move to this app and it's been a miserable experience from the get go. Was able to make do but recent updates have been awful. Sorting on albums went from alphabetical to recent activity and no way to change. Now latest one could no longer access the gigs of downloads I had so I had to reinstall and now redownload everything. Truly awful. Would not use if it was the only option for subscribers.
"App used to work fine, now it is completely unsuable. Music playback won't go for more than 5 seconds. Locking the device freezes everything and forces a restart. Using a usb-c to 3.5 mm canle in the car just makes the issues worse. Wouldn't want my worst enemies to have to use this app. Can't even play back local files on the device. At least the google play music app had basic functionality. Would give less stars if I could"
"I have been using this app for a year or more now and it has had issues before but they was resolved. It's been 2 days now and I still can't use the app. Sounds like I'm listening to a scratched CD. I've tried clearing the cache, restarting my phone and stopping the app. Nothing is helping. If this continues to be an issue, I will be cancelling my subscription and finding another music app to use that won't give me these issues."
"The app literally never loads the first anymore on WiFi or mobile data. I can't even listen to a full album that I supposedly have downloaded without losing connection by the 3rd song. I want an offline mode that functions like the old Google music - if I am downloading songs, they should be downloaded to my phone and not need to be streamed. So incredibly frustrating, and the only solution is to restart the app 2+ times to get the next song to load before it drops again. Need a hotfix asap"
This app was amazing until just recently. The songs keep stopping randomly. You have to open the app back up and press play again. It's VERY IRRITATING to be paying for a service and not getting the service your paying for. It doesn't even matter if you keep the app open while playing music it still stops randomly and it sucks honestly. Whatever happened needs to be fixed.
"I use to swear by this app/service and recommend it to everyone however over the past few months it has been insufferable. The app crashes & buffers constantly and makes it impossible to enjoy my music. This has been a well known issue for MONTHS, and you all have released several updates doing various things (i.e meddling with UI), but not fixing the core functionality. I'm seriously looking into other alternatives now."
"Well, it was at 3 stars, new update and redesign have dropped it down to 2. I put music from my laptop onto my phone. Before the update, everything loaded fine... this redesign is stupid.. 5 mins to load songs. Another few to load the artist tab or album tab. You are working on a 1-star rating if this issue doesn't get fixed. Nothing was wrong with the old look.. you had long enough to fix things, so 1 star."
"I have been a paying YouTube music fan for years. But lately, I've been having issues with playing the music that I've downloaded, and a couple of other issues I've noticed have come up in the last couple of months as well. I'm very disappointed and will probably not continue to pay for this if these issues aren't addressed and corrected. YTM is going to lose a lot of faithful customers if something isn't corrected soon. â¹ð * I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED in this app. ð"
This used to be the best music app available. Then a couple updates back I started to have problems accessing my music in the app. Haven't been able to play my music for nearly 2 weeks now. Contacted customer service who had me repeat all the steps I already tried then told me it had been escalated to the tech people who would advise customer service when it would be fixed. Keep in mind I pay for the premium service but can't access my music library at all. If I could rate zero I would. Very sad
"This app was great for the first TWO weeks. It would let me play music in the background, turn my phone off, and the music would still play. But after that, it wouldn't even let me do that stuff without getting a buying an upgrade or buying youtube music premium. Also, I would have to listen to ads after every song. So that is why it is getting ONE star from me."
"This update is too glitchy. The music continues to stop which is quite annoying, especially when working out. If this proceeds, I may just cancel the subscription and stick with Spotify. This is just way too annoying, it defeats the purpose of paying for a subscription to listen to ad free music when the music continues to stop."
"O look a new lie! The history button is another bs lie. It just gives you a duplicate of the playlist. I did NOT LISTEN TO MOST OF THEM! everything about this app. Throw it out and bring google music back it actually ran properly. This thing after an hr of hitting the same to songs back to back so it will play them back to back, youtube m is to stupid to understand what you want. Google music would have figured it out after the second time. Just shows the Intelligence of the people who made it."
"Very disappointed, I have Ben's using this app since it was Google Music. The app continues to stop playing music. This happens when steaming or when playing songs downloaded to my device. It's happened with 2 separate phones so I know it's not a device or user error issue. I pay monthly for premium and I am really close to cancelling and trying Spotify or Tidal. I might even do Amazon Music. Fix this with an update immediately!"
"I thought it was because i haven't updated both my youtube and YouTube music for a while that it was happening but even after updating them (today), both the apps freeze on their own, the musics and videos stops playing on their own even when the network speed is okay for some unknown reason that it is becoming annoying. Please see to this issue and fix this."
"Frustrating, they are trying to police account sharing but in the process they are screwing over people who use multiple devices. I listen to music on my tablet at night and on my phone during the day. I accidentally left my tablet going. It keeps timing out my phone instead of my tablet. There is none home to turn it off. I can't go back. This app should prioritize the device that has interaction instead of the device that's been going longer. This is beyond stupid."
"Downloaded songs won't play offline. The interface is completely internet based, so everything about the app freezes and spins continuously because there's no internet. Going to downloads > playing albums guarantees I get one song before everything freezes for the remainder of my 30min trip. Absolutely awful. I can't believe Google Listen died for this to not work at all."
"Had Google music and bought my music that I liked and could play it anytime with or without signal on a blank screen. Now that it's on YouTube music I can't listen to my music while driving because I live in sparce cell signal and will not load, also the screen has to stay on or it will shut off as well. Or I have to basically buy a monthly subscription and repay for the music I have already bought. Very frustrated with this service. Would not recommend."
This is a terrible app that was rushed out by somebody who has obviously never actually used it themselves. It randomly stopped playing music. It randomly crashes. It removed a lot of the functionality of Google play music especially when hooked up to Android auto. All in all this app is worse in every possible regard to the one that replaced. 2023- still a horrible app that for some reason has not yet reached feature parity with Google music back in 2016
"I've been using this app/its predecessors for years. YT Music has been crashing for over a month, so I can't listen to my music and it's killing my battery too. I thought it'd be fixed with recent updates, but it hasn't been. Tried reaching out to developers and got an autoresponse to use 'Help & Feedback' - that won't work either! I already cleared my cache, un/re installed, etc. I keep having to use pandora instead, so what am I paying for this for? Used to be good before continuous crashing"
"It's like every other music app, there's really nothing setting this one apart from others - except recently, it's doing these ""age checks"" on certain music. I tried to download an album and it wouldn't download certain songs. It also wouldn't provide me the option to ""prove"" my age. So you can take my money and censor what music I listen to? Classy."
"Only thing worth it is no ads on regular YT. Their algorithm is so bad for the next songs to recommend (only picks songs you've already played/are on a playlist of yours) you barely get any new music. Explore page is terrible...there's a total of maybe 10 playlists that update. Lastly search functionality is horrendous. If you're looking for a music video, playlist, whatever - good luck. They only give you the results they feel like giving you."
"The least you can do is make sure when going through your ""downloaded music"" it's in the order you downloaded when playing your music. It keeps jumping to different songs throughout the download Playlist. You would think that a genius would at least understand what order means. The old downloads tab was way better three-four updates ago. I forget, because what we have now makes it that much more shittier driving. An extra two click is enough for me to get into a driving accident. You guys suck"
"The songs stops randomly, regardless of being on WIFI or mobile data. The controls are not always displayed on the lock screen, forcing me to unlock the phone, open the app to only then change to the next song to make it to play again. If it doesn't get fixed I'll have to switch to another provider... Terrible user experience."
